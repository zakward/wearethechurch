      "4": "Nevertheless, David had brought the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, after having erected a tent for it in Jerusalem.",
      "5": "Also, the bronze altar that Uri’s son Bezalel, Hur’s grandson, had erected, was in place in front of the Lord’s tent. Solomon and the assembly sought the Lord there.",
      "6": "Solomon approached the presence of the Lord at the bronze altar that had been placed at the Tent of Meeting and offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.",
      "7": "That very night God appeared to Solomon and told him, “Ask what I am to give you.”",
      "8": "Solomon replied to God, “You showed great gracious love to my father David, and have established me as king in his place.",
      "9": "Now, Lord God, your promise to my father David is fulfilled, because you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.",
      "10": "Give me wisdom now, so I may go in and out among this people, because who can rule this great people that belongs to you?",
      "11": "God told Solomon, “Since you had this in mind, to ask neither to focus on riches, wealth, honor, or the lives of those who hate you, nor have you requested a long life, but instead you have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you may rule my people over whom I have established you as king,",
      "12": "wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. Furthermore, I will give you riches, wealth, and honor—such as none of the kings owned who lived before you and none after you are to ever attain their equal.”",

This is mandated forever in Israel.",
      "5": "“The Temple that I’m building will be great, because the greatness of our God surpasses that of all gods.",

      "10": "“Now look! I will pay your servants, the lumberjacks who prepare the timber, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.”",
      "11": "In a letter that he sent to Solomon, King Hiram of Tyre wrote, “Because he loves his people, the Lord has placed you as king over them.”",

      "13": "Now I’m sending along Hiram-abi, a skilled craftsman, who is very creative.",
      "14": "He is the son of a mother from the tribe of Dan, and his father is from Tyre. He’s skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and timber, as well as in purple, blue, linen, and crimson materials. He is skilled in engravings, and can craft any design to which he may be assigned. He will work with your skilled artisans and with all of your craftsmen who have been assigned by my lord David, your father.",

Why should you be struck down?”\nSo the prophet stopped speaking, but he also said, “I know God has determined to destroy you, because you’ve done all this and ignored my counsel.”",
