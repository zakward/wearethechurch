      "2": "“Utterly pointless,”\n        says the Teacher.\n“Absolutely pointless;\n    everything is pointless.”",
      "3": "What does a man gain\n    from all of the work that he undertakes on earth?",
      "4": "A generation goes,\n    a generation comes,\n        but the earth remains forever.",
      "5": "The sun rises,\n    the sun sets,\n        then rushes back to where it arose.",
      "6": "The wind blows southward,\n    then northward, constantly circulating,\n        and the wind comes back again in its courses.",
      "7": "All the rivers flow toward the sea,\n    but the sea is never full;\n        then rivers return to the headwaters where they began.",
      "8": "Everything is wearisome,\n    more than man is able to express.\nThe eye is never satisfied by seeing,\n    nor the ear by hearing.",
      "9": "Whatever has happened, will happen again;\n    whatever has been done, will be done again.\n        There is nothing new on earth.",
      "10": "Does anything exist about which someone might say,\n    “Look at this! Is this new?”\nIt happened ages ago;\n    it existed before we did.",
      "11": "No one remembers those in the past,\n    nor will they be remembered\n        by those who come after them.",
      "12": "I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I dedicated myself to using wisdom for study and discovery of everything that is done under heaven. God uses terrible things so human beings will struggle with life.",
      "14": "I observed every activity done on earth. My conclusion: all of it is pointless—like chasing after the wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be made straight;\n    what is not there cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I told myself, “I have become greater and wiser than anyone who ruled before me in Jerusalem—yes, I have acquired a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "So I dedicated myself to learn about wisdom and knowledge, and about insanity and foolishness. And I discovered that this is also like chasing after the wind.",
      "18": "For with much wisdom there is much sorrow;\n    the more someone adds to knowledge,\n        the more someone adds to grief."

      "1": "I told myself, “I will test you with pleasure, so enjoy yourself.” But this was pointless.",
      "2": "“Senseless,” said I concerning laughter and pleasure, “How practical is this?”",
      "3": "I decided to indulge in wine, while still remaining committed to wisdom. I also tried to indulge in foolishness, just enough to determine whether it was good for human beings under heaven given the short time of their lives.",
      "4": "With respect to my extravagant works, I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.",
      "5": "I constructed gardens and orchards for myself, and within them I planted all kinds of fruit trees.",
      "6": "I built for myself water reservoirs to irrigate forests that produce trees.",
      "7": "I acquired male and female slaves, and had other slaves born in my house. I also acquired for myself increasing numbers of herds and flocks—more than anyone who had lived before me in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "I also accumulated silver, gold, and the wealth of kings and their kingdoms. I gathered around me both male and female singers, along with what delights a man—all sorts of mistresses.",
      "9": "So I became great, greater than anyone who had lived before me in Jerusalem. Throughout all of this, I remained wise.",
      "10": "Whenever I wanted something I had seen, I never refused that desire. Instead, I enjoyed everything I did, and this became the reward in what I had undertaken.",
      "11": "Then I examined all of my accomplishments that I had brought about by my own efforts, including the work that I had labored so hard to complete—and it was all pointless, like chasing after the wind, and there was nothing to be gained on earth.",
      "12": "Next I turned to examine wisdom, insanity, and foolishness, because what can a person do who succeeds the king except what has already been accomplished?",
      "13": "I concluded that wisdom is more useful than foolishness, just as light is more useful than darkness.",
      "14": "The wise use their eyes, but the fool walks in darkness. I also perceived that the same outcome affects them all.",
      "15": "Then I told myself, “Whatever happens to the fool will happen also to me. Therefore what’s the point in being so wise?” And I told myself that this also is pointless.",
      "16": "For neither the wise nor the fool will be long remembered, since in days to come everything will be forgotten. The wise man dies the same way as the fool, does he not?",
      "17": "So I hated life, because whatever is done on earth causes me trouble—it’s all pointless, like chasing after the wind.",
      "18": "Then I despised everything I had worked for on earth, that is, the things that I will leave to the person who will succeed me.",
      "19": "And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Either way, he will take possession of everything that I have done on earth, especially where I have excelled. This also is pointless.",
      "20": "So I came to be in despair about everything I had accomplished on earth.",
      "21": "For sometimes people who strive to obtain wisdom, knowledge, and equity leave everything as an inheritance to a person who never worked for it. This, too, is pointless and greatly troublesome.",
      "22": "For what does a person gain from everything that he accomplishes and from his inner life struggles that he undergoes while working on earth?",
      "23": "Indeed, all of his days are filled with sorrow, and his struggles bring grief. In fact, his mind remains restless throughout the night. This is pointless, too!",
      "24": "The only worthwhile thing for a human being is to eat, drink, and enjoy life’s goodness that he finds in what he accomplishes. This, I observed, is also from the hand of God himself,",
      "25": "for who can eat or enjoy life apart from him?",
      "26": "After all, to the person who is good in God’s sight, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner he gives the troublesome task of acquiring and accumulating in order to leave it to someone who is good in the sight of God. This also is pointless and chasing after the wind."

      "15": "That which was, now is; and that which will be, already is; and God examines what has already taken place.",

      "18": "“As for human beings,” I told myself, “God puts them to the test, that they might see themselves as mere animals.”",
      "19": "For what happens to people also happens to animals—a single event happens to them: just as someone dies, so does the other. In fact, they all breathe the same way, so that a human being has no superiority over an animal. All of this is pointless.",
      "20": "All of them go to one place: all of them originate from dust, and all of them return to dust.",
      "21": "Who knows whether the spirit of human beings ascends, and whether the spirit of animals descends to the earth?",

      "3": "Better than both of them is someone who has not yet been born, because he hasn’t experienced evil on earth.",
      "4": "Then I examined all sorts of work, including all kinds of excellent achievements that create envy in others. This also is pointless and chasing after the wind.",

      "6": "It’s better to have one handful of tranquility than to have two handfuls of trouble and to chase after the wind.",
      "7": "Then I turned to re-examine something else that is pointless on earth:",
      "8": "Consider someone who is alone, having neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his work, and he is never satisfied with wealth. “So for whom do I work,” he asks, “and deprive myself of pleasure?” This, too, is pointless and a terrible tragedy.",
      "9": "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.",
      "10": "If they stumble, the first will lift up his friend—but woe to anyone who is alone when he falls and there is no one to help him get up.",
      "11": "Again, if two lie close together, they will keep warm, but how can only one stay warm?",
      "12": "If someone attacks one of them, the two of them together will resist. Furthermore, the tri-braided cord is not soon broken.",
      "13": "A poor but wise youth is better\n    than an old but foolish king\n        who will no longer accept correction.",
