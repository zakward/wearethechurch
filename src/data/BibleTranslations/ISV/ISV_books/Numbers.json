A group of people have escaped from Egypt. They cover the surface of the whole earth, and are sitting here right in front of me.",

      "26": "Then the angel of the Lord went along a little further and stood in a much narrower space, where it was impossible to turn either right or left.",
      "27": "When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she crouched down under Balaam. As a result, Balaam got so angry that he started to whip the donkey with his staff.",
      "28": "That’s when the Lord enabled the donkey to speak. She asked Balaam, “What did I do to you that you would beat me in the space of only three footsteps?”",
      "29": "“Because you’re playing a dirty trick on me,” Balaam answered the donkey. “If only I had a sword in my hand! I’d kill you right now!”",
      "30": "But in response, the donkey asked Balaam, “I’m your donkey that you’ve ridden on in the past without incident, am I not, and I’m the same donkey you’re riding on right now, am I not? Am I in the habit of treating you like this?”\n“No,” he admitted.",
      "31": "Then the Lord enabled Balaam to see, so he observed the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with an unsheathed sword in his hand. So he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.",
      "32": "Then the angel of the Lord asked him, “Why did you beat your donkey in the space of only three footsteps? I’ve come to oppose you, because I say that what you’re doing is perverted.",
      "33": "The donkey saw me and turned in front of me in the space of those three footsteps.",
      "34": "If she hadn’t turned away from me, I would have killed you by now and left her alive!”\nAt this, Balaam replied to the angel of the Lord, “I’ve sinned! I didn’t know that you were standing to meet me on the road. So now, since it displeases you, let me go back.”",
      "35": "But the angel of the Lord told Balaam, “Go with the men, but deliver only the message that I’m going to give you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials.",
      "36": "When Balak heard that Balaam had arrived, he went out to meet him in the city of Moab on the border of Arnon at the extreme end of his territory.",
