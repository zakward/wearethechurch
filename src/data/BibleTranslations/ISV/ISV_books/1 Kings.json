      "1": "When David had grown very old, they covered him with blankets, but he could not keep warm,",
      "2": "so his servants suggested to him, “Let’s look for a young virgin woman to take care of you, your majesty. She will be of use to you if you have her lie down near you so that your majesty may keep warm.”",
      "3": "So they conducted a search throughout the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman, and Abishag the Shunammite was located and brought to the king.",
      "4": "The young woman was absolutely beautiful. She served the king and was very useful to him. The king was not sexually involved with her.",
      "5": "Meanwhile, about this time Haggith’s son Adonijah began to seek a reputation for himself and decided, “I’m going to be king!” So he prepared chariots, cavalry, and 50 soldiers to serve as a security detail to guard him.",
      "6": "His father had never challenged him at any time during his life by asking him, “Why are you acting like this?” Adonijah was very handsome and had been born after Absalom.",
      "7": "He had the support of Zeruiah’s son Joab and of Abiathar the priest, who followed Adonijah and assisted him,",
      "8": "but Zadok the priest, Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s personal elite forces would have nothing to do with Adonijah.",
      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the Serpent Stone near En-rogel, inviting all of his relatives, the king’s sons, and all of the men of Judah who worked for the king,",
      "10": "but he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, David’s personal elite forces, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "“Haven’t you heard?” Nathan asked Solomon’s mother Bathsheba. “Haggith’s son Adonijah has become king and David, our true king, isn’t aware of it.",
      "12": "If you listen to me, you’ll save your life and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go right now to King David and ask him, ‘Your majesty, you promised your servant that “Your son Solomon will certainly become king after me and will sit on my throne,” didn’t you? So why has Adonijah become king?’",
      "14": "Then, while you are still talking to the king, I’ll come in after you and verify your statement.”",
      "15": "So Bathsheba went to the king in his private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.",
      "16": "Bathsheba knelt and bowed down to the king, and the king asked her, “What do you wish?”",
      "17": "“Your majesty,” she replied, “you promised your servant in the name of the Lord your God, ‘Your son Solomon will certainly become king after me and will sit on my throne.’",
      "18": "Now look, Adonijah has become king, and your majesty is not aware of it.",
      "19": "Adonijah has sacrificed myriads of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep, and he has invited all of the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited your servant Solomon.",
      "20": "And as for you, your majesty, everyone in Israel is looking to you to tell them who will sit on your majesty’s throne after you.",
      "21": "Otherwise, as soon as your majesty is laid to rest with his ancestors, my son Solomon and I will be branded as traitors.”",
      "22": "While she was still talking to the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.",
      "23": "They informed the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.”\nWhen he had been ushered into the presence of the king, Nathan bowed low in front of the king with his face to the ground",
      "24": "and asked, “Your majesty, did you say ‘Adonijah will be king after me and will sit on my throne’?",
      "25": "Well now, he went down today and sacrificed lots of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep, and has invited all the king’s sons, the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. They’re having a party together and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "Of course, he never invited me, Zadok the priest, Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, nor your servant Solomon.",
      "27": "Were you behind this, your majesty, without letting your servants know who would sit on your majesty’s throne after him?”",
      "28": "“Call Bathsheba for me,” King David replied. So she came in and stood in front of the king.",
      "29": "“As the Lord lives,” the king said with an oath, “who has redeemed me from all sorts of troubles,",
      "30": "I certainly did tell you in the name of the Lord God of Israel, ‘Your son Solomon will be king after me and will sit on my throne in my place.’ I’m certainly going to make this happen today!”",
      "31": "“King David,” Bathsheba said as she bowed low in front of the king with her face to the ground, “your majesty, may you live forever.”",
      "32": "“Get me Zadok the priest,” King David said, “along with Nathan the prophet, and Jehoiada’s son Benaiah.” So they were ushered into the king’s presence",
      "33": "and David addressed them. “Take your lord’s servants, have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.",
      "34": "Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then sound a trumpet and declare ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "35": "After this, you are to follow him back here, and he is to come and sit on my throne and take my place as king, because I’ve appointed him to be Commander-in-Chief over Israel and Judah.”",
      "36": "“Amen!” replied Jehoiada’s son Benaiah to the king. “May the Lord God of your majesty make this happen!",
      "37": "As the Lord has been with your majesty the king, so may he be with Solomon. May he make his throne greater than the throne of your majesty, King David.”",
      "38": "So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, and the special forces and mercenaries went out and had Solomon ride the king’s mule all the way to Gihon.",
      "39": "Zadok the priest brought from his tent a horn filled with oil and anointed Solomon, a trumpet was sounded, and everybody yelled out, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "40": "All the people followed after him, playing on wind pipes and so full of joy that the earth shook because of all the noise!",
      "41": "Right about then, Adonijah and all of his guests were just finishing their meal when they heard all the noise. “Why is the city in such an uproar?” Joab asked as he heard the trumpet sounds.",
      "42": "While he was still asking that question, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest arrived, so Adonijah told him, “Come on in, since you’re a worthy man and are bringing us good news!”",
      "43": "“No,” Jonathan answered. “Our lord King David has installed Solomon as king.",
      "44": "The king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, and the special forces and mercenaries, along with Solomon, who is riding the king’s personal mule.",
      "45": "Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gihon, and they just left from there rejoicing, and that’s why the city is all in an uproar. That’s the noise that you’ve been hearing!",
      "46": "Solomon now sits on the royal throne.",
      "47": "In addition to all of this, the king’s servants have come along to congratulate our lord King David. They’ve been telling David ‘May your God make Solomon’s reputation even more famous than yours, and may he make his throne greater than yours!’ The king has himself bowed in worship on his own bed",
      "48": "and said ‘Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who has provided someone to sit on my throne today. I’ve seen it with my own eyes!’”",
      "49": "Terrified, all of Adonijah’s guests jumped up and ran away.",
      "50": "Afraid of Solomon, Adonijah also jumped up and headed straight for the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "“Hey look!” somebody informed Solomon. “Adonijah is terrified of King Solomon! He’s gone out, grabbed hold of the horns of the altar, and now he’s begging King Solomon, ‘Swear to me that you won’t put your servant to death with a sword!’”",
      "52": "“If he’s done nothing wrong, not a hair of his head will be harmed,” Solomon replied. “But if we find evil in him, he’s a dead man.”",
      "53": "So King Solomon sent for him, and he was brought down from the altar. When he had arrived, he fell on his face in front of King Solomon, so Solomon told him, “Go home!”"

      "1": "As David’s time to die approached, he addressed his son Solomon with these words:",
      "2": "“I’m headed down the road that everyone who lives on earth travels, so be strong and demonstrate that you’re a grown man",
      "3": "by keeping the charge that the Lord your God entrusted to you. Live life his way, keep his statutes, his commands, his ordinances, and his testimonies, just as they’re written down in the Law of Moses, so that you may succeed in everything you do and wherever you go,",
      "4": "and so that the Lord may fulfill his promise that he spoke about me when he said, ‘If your sons pay attention to how they live by walking truthfully in my presence with all their heart and with all their soul, you will never lack a man on the throne of Israel.’",
      "5": "“Furthermore, you’re aware of what Zeruiah’s son Joab did to me and to those two commanders of the armies of Israel, Ner’s son Abner and Jether’s son Amasa, whom he killed, and how he shed the blood of wartime during times of peace, staining the very belt he wears around his waist and the sandals he wears on his feet.",
      "6": "So act consistently with your wisdom, and don’t let him die as a peaceful old man.",
      "7": "Be gracious to the descendants of Barzillai the Gileadite, and provide for them in your household, because they helped me when I had to run from your brother Absalom.",
      "8": "“Pay attention now! You have with you Gera’s son Shimei the descendant of Benjamin from Bahurim. He cursed me violently that day when I had to leave for Mahanaim. When he visited me at the Jordan River, I made an oath to the Lord and told him, ‘I won’t execute you with a sword.’",
      "9": "But don’t let him off unpunished, since you’re a wise man and you’ll know what you need to do to him. Find a way that he dies in his old age by shedding his blood.”",
      "10": "After this, David died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in the City of David.",
      "11": "David had reigned over Israel for 40 years. He reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for 33 years.",
      "12": "Solomon then assumed his father David’s throne, and his kingdom was firmly established.",
      "13": "Later, Haggith’s son Adonijah approached Solomon’s mother. “Are you here on a peaceful mission?” she asked.\n“Yes,” he replied.",
      "14": "“I have something to ask you about.”\n“Talk,” she told him.",
      "15": "So he replied, “You know that the kingdom should have come to me, and that everyone in Israel intended to place me as the next king. However, the kingdom has turned around and now belongs to my brother, because it went to him from the Lord.",
      "16": "So now I’m asking one thing from you. Don’t refuse me.”\n“Talk,” she told him.",
      "17": "Then he asked her, “Please talk to King Solomon for me, since he won’t refuse you. Ask him to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”",
      "18": "“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I’ll talk to the king for you.”",
      "19": "So Bathsheba went to talk to King Solomon for Adonijah. The king rose to meet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. He ordered a throne be set in place for his mother. She sat on a throne to his right",
      "20": "and told him, “I would like to make a minor request of you. Please don’t refuse me.”\n“What is your request, mother?” the king asked her. “I won’t turn you down.”",
      "21": "So she asked him, “Give Abishag the Shunammite to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”",
      "22": "But King Solomon replied to his mother, “Why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Why not ask me to give up the kingdom for him, since he’s my older brother, and why not ask for Abiathar the priest, and for Zeruiah’s son Joab?”",
      "23": "Then King Solomon took this oath in the name of the Lord: “May God do so to me, and more besides, if Adonijah hasn’t endangered his life by bringing up this subject.",
      "24": "Now therefore, as the Lord lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of my father David, and who has established a dynasty, just like he promised, Adonijah will surely be executed today.”",
      "25": "So King Solomon sent for Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, who attacked and killed Adonijah.",
      "26": "The king also told Abiathar the priest, “Go home to Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I won’t kill you today, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David and because you shared all the troubles that my father went through.”",
      "27": "So Solomon fired Abiathar as the Lord’s priest, thus fulfilling the promise that the Lord had spoken in Shiloh concerning Eli’s household.",
      "28": "When Joab learned what had happened, he ran to the Lord’s tent and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar, since Joab had supported Adonijah (though he had not supported Absalom).",
      "29": "Somebody informed King Solomon, “Joab just ran to the Lord’s tent and now he’s standing beside the altar!”\nBut Solomon ordered Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, “Go kill him!”",
      "30": "So Benaiah went into the Lord’s tent and told Joab, “The king orders you to come out!”\n“No,” Joab said, “I’d rather die here!”\nSo Benaiah went and informed the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”",
      "31": "The king replied to him, “Do just what he asked. Kill him and bury him so that you may remove from me and from my father’s household the guilt that Joab shed needlessly.",
      "32": "The Lord will repay him for his bloodshed because, without my father David’s consent he attacked and murdered two men more righteous and better than he, Ner’s son Abner, the commander of Israel’s army and Jether’s son Amasa, commander of Judah’s army.",
      "33": "May their blood be repaid to Joab and to his descendants forever, and may there be peace shown from the Lord forever to David, to his descendants, to his household, and to his throne.”",
      "34": "Jehoiada’s son Benaiah then approached Joab, attacked him, killed him, and had him buried at Joab’s home in the wilderness.",
      "35": "The king appointed Jehoiada’s son Benaiah in charge of the army to replace Joab and also appointed Zadok the priest to replace Abiathar.",
      "36": "The king sent for Shimei and told him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but don’t go anywhere from there.",
      "37": "If you ever leave and cross the Kidron Brook, you can be sure that you’ll die. You’ll be responsible for your own death.”",
      "38": "Shimei replied to the king, “What your majesty has decreed is acceptable to me. I’ll do what you’ve said.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for quite some time.",
      "39": "But three years later, two of Shimei’s servants escaped to Maacah’s son Achish, the king of Gath.\nSomebody told Shimei, “Look! Your servants went to Gath!”",
      "40": "So Shimei got up, saddled a donkey, and traveled to Gath to find his servants. He found them and brought them back from Gath.",
      "41": "Later, Solomon found out that Shimei had left Jerusalem, gone to Gath, and had returned,",
      "42": "so the king sent for Shimei and asked him, “Didn’t I make a promise to the Lord and warn you, ‘The day you leave and go anywhere else, you can be sure you’ll die’? And you told me, ‘What your majesty has decreed is acceptable to me.’",
      "43": "So why haven’t you kept the oath you made to the Lord, and why didn’t you obey my personal order to you?”",
      "44": "The king also reminded Shimei, “You know all the evil things that you admit you did to my father David. Therefore the Lord is going to repay you for all of your evil.",
      "45": "But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will be established in the presence of the Lord forever.”",
      "46": "So the king gave orders to Jehoiada’s son Benaiah to go out, attack Shimei, and kill him. That is how the kingdom was established under Solomon’s control."

      "1": "Later, Solomon intermarried with the family of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt by taking his daughter and bringing her to the City of David to live until he had completed building his own palace, the Lord’s Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem.",
      "2": "The people were sacrificing at various high places because the Temple had not yet been built and dedicated to the Lord.",
      "3": "Solomon loved the Lord, and lived according to the statutes that his father David obeyed, except that he sacrificed and burned offerings at the high places.",
      "4": "The king used to go to Gibeon to sacrifice, since there was a famous high place there, where Solomon once offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar.",
      "5": "The Lord appeared to Solomon one night in a dream and told him, “Ask me for whatever you want and I’ll give it to you.”",
      "6": "So Solomon said:\n“You have demonstrated abundant gracious love to your servant David, my father, as he lived in your presence truthfully, righteously, and uprightly in his heart. In addition, you have kept on showing this abundant gracious love by giving him a son to sit on his throne today.",
      "7": "Now, Lord my God, you have set me as king to replace my father David, but I’m still young. I don’t have any leadership skills.",
      "8": "Your servant lives in the midst of your people that you have chosen, a great people that is too numerous to be counted.",
      "9": "So give your servant an understanding mind to govern your people, so I can discern between good and evil. Otherwise, how will I be able to govern this great people of yours?”",
      "10": "The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this,",
      "11": "so God told him:\n“Because you asked for this, and you didn’t ask for a long life for yourself, and you didn’t ask for the lives of your enemies, but instead you’ve asked for discernment so you can understand how to govern,",
      "12": "look how I’m going to do precisely what you asked. I’m giving you a wise and discerning mind, so that there will have been no one like you before you and no one will arise after you like you.",
      "13": "I’m also giving you what you haven’t requested: both riches and honor, so that no other king will be comparable to you during your lifetime.",
      "14": "If you will live life my way, keeping my statutes and my commands, just like your father David did, I’ll also increase the length of your life.”",
      "15": "Then Solomon woke up and realized that he had dreamed a dream. Then he went back to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant, offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and threw a party for all of his servants.",
      "16": "Right about then, two prostitutes approached the king and requested an audience with him.",
      "17": "One woman said, “Your majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.",
      "18": "Three days later, this woman also gave birth. We lived alone there. There was nobody else with us in the house. It was just the two of us.",
      "19": "This woman’s son died overnight because she laid on top of him.",
      "20": "She got up in the middle of the night, took my son from me while your servant was asleep, and laid him to her breast after laying her dead son next to me.",
      "21": "The next morning, I got up to nurse my son, and he was dead. But when I examined him carefully in the light of day, he turned out not to be my son whom I had borne!”",
      "22": "“Not so,” claimed the other woman. “The living child is my son, and the dead one is yours.”\nBut the first woman said, “Not so! The dead child is your son and the living one is my son.” This is what they testified before the king.",
      "23": "The king said, “One of them claims, ‘This living son is mine, and your son is the dead one’ and the other claims ‘No. Your son is the dead one and my son is the living one.’",
      "24": "“Somebody get me a sword.” So they brought a sword to the king.",
      "25": "“Divide the living child in two!” he ordered. “Give half to the one and half to the other.”",
      "26": "The woman whose child was still alive cried out to the king, because her heart yearned for her son. “Oh no, your majesty!” she said. “Give her the living child. Please don’t kill him.”\nBut the other woman said, “Cut him in half! That way, he’ll belong to neither one of us.”",
      "27": "The king announced his decision: “Give the living child to the first woman. Don’t kill him. She is his mother.”",

      "3": "A portico extended in front of the Temple for 20 cubits outward, corresponding to the width of the Temple. Along the front of the Temple its depth was ten cubits.",
      "4": "Solomon also constructed windows in the Temple with specially designed frames.",
      "5": "Against the wall of the Temple he built a series of rooms that encompassed the exterior of the Temple walls around the inner sanctuary. He built these side chambers all around the building.",
      "6": "The lower structures were five cubits wide, the middle structures were six cubits wide and the third structures were seven cubits wide. Offsets were placed all around the Temple so that beams would not protrude through the walls of the Temple.",
      "7": "The Temple was constructed of stone precut at the quarry so that no hammer, axe, or any other iron implement would be heard in the Temple while it was being built.",

Furthermore, their wings in the center of the wall were touching each other wing-to-wing.",

      "32": "He installed two doors made of olive wood, inlaying them with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and blooming flowers, and overlaying them with gold. Then he added more gold to cover the cherubim and palm trees.",

      "7": "He constructed the Judgment Hall for the throne room where he would be ruling, paneling it with cedar from floor to ceiling.",
      "8": "Solomon’s personal dwelling quarters, a separate court behind the hall, was of similar workmanship. Solomon also built a house similar to this for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had married.",

      "15": "He fashioned two bronze pillars, each one eighteen cubits high, with a circumference of twelve cubits.",
      "16": "He also crafted two capitals of cast bronze and set them on top of the pillars. The height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.",

      "22": "The work on the pillars was finished with a lily design on top of the pillars.",
      "23": "Hiram also made a sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in shape and five cubits and 30 cubits in its inner circumference.",
      "24": "Under the brim, completely encircling it, were two rows of gourds inlaid as part of the original casting, ten to a cubit.",
      "25": "The sea stood on top of twelve oxen. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The sea was set on top of them, and their hind parts faced the center.",
      "26": "The reservoir, which held about 2,000 baths, stood about a handbreadth thick, and its rim looked like the brim of a cup or of a lily blossom.",
      "27": "Hiram also made ten bronze water carts. Each one was four cubits wide, four cubits long, and three cubits high.",
      "28": "The carts were designed with borders between cross-pieces,",
      "29": "and on the borders between the cross-pieces were lions, oxen, and cherubim. A pedestal was placed above the cross-pieces, and beneath the lions and oxen there were wreaths hanging down.",
      "30": "Each cart had four bronze wheels equipped with bronze axles with four support feet. Beneath the basin were cast support structures made like wreaths on each side.",
      "31": "The opening to each water cart inside the crown on top was one cubit wide, with engravings on the opening. The borders to the frames surrounding the opening were square, not round.",
      "32": "The four wheels were placed underneath the borders, and the axles for the wheels were on the stand. Each wheel stood one and a half cubits high.",
      "33": "The wheels resembled those of a chariot, with their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs made of cast bronze.",
      "34": "Four supports stood at the four corners of each cart, built into the carts themselves.",
      "35": "On top of each stand was a circular structure one half of one cubit high, with its braces and support frames integral with it, forming a single piece.",
      "36": "Hiram engraved ornamental cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and frames wherever there was space to do so, and encircled the artwork with wreaths.",
      "37": "He made ten identical water carts by using the same plans, castings, and shapes for all of them.",
      "38": "Hiram also fashioned ten bronze basins, each holding about 40 baths, each basin measuring four cubits in diameter, with one basin for each stand.",
      "39": "He set five of the stands on the right side of the Temple and five on the left side of the Temple. He set the bronze sea on the right side of the Temple eastward facing the south.",
      "40": "Hiram also made the basins, shovels, and bowls to complete the work that he performed for King Solomon in the Lord’s Temple,",

      "42": "plus the 400 pomegranates for the two lattices (that is, the two rows of pomegranates for each lattice to cover the two bowls of the capitals that stood on top of the pillars),",
      "43": "the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands,",
      "44": "the single bronze sea and the twelve oxen that stood under the sea,",
      "45": "and the pots, shovels, and bowls—all of these utensils that Hiram made for King Solomon for the Lord’s Temple were made from polished bronze.",
      "46": "The king had them cast in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan in the Jordan plain.",
      "47": "Solomon never inventoried the weight of the bronze used, because there were too many utensils, so the weight of the bronze used was never ascertained.",
      "48": "Solomon made all the furnishings that were placed in the Lord’s Temple, including the golden altar and the golden table on which the bread of the Presence was placed,",
      "49": "along with the lamp stands (five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary), all made of pure gold, as well as the flower blossoms, lamps, and tongs of gold,",
      "50": "and the cups, snuffers, bowls, spoons, and the fire pans, all made of pure gold, and hinges for the doors of the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place, and for the gates of the Temple that led to the nave, also of gold.",
      "51": "Thus all the work that King Solomon performed in the Lord’s Temple was finished. Then Solomon brought in the articles that had been dedicated by his father David, including silver, gold, and other utensils, and he placed them into storage in the treasuries of the Lord’s Temple."

      "14": "“I’ve been very zealous for the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies,” he replied. “The Israelis have abandoned your covenant, demolished your altars, executed your prophets with swords, and I—that’s right, just me!—am the only one left. Now they’re seeking my life, to get rid of me!”",
      "15": "The Lord replied to him, “Go! Return to Damascus, and when you get there, anoint Hazael as king over Aram,",
      "16": "anoint Nimshi’s son Jehu as king over Israel, and anoint Shaphat’s son Elisha from Abel-meholah as a prophet to replace you.",
      "17": "Whoever escapes from Hazael’s sword Jehu will execute, and whoever escapes from Jehu’s sword Elisha will put to death.",
      "18": "Nevertheless, I’ve reserved 7,000 in Israel who have neither bowed their knees to Baal nor kissed him.”",
      "19": "Elijah left there and located Shaphat’s son Elisha, who was plowing, along with a total of twelve pairs of oxen. (He was plowing with the twelfth pair.) As Elijah passed by, he tossed his cloak at Elisha.",
      "20": "He abandoned the oxen, ran off to follow Elijah, and asked him, “Please, let me kiss my mother and father good-bye, and then I’ll come after you.”\n“Go back again,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?”",
      "21": "So Elisha turned back, took the pair of oxen, sacrificed them, boiled their flesh using the farm implements for fuel, and gave the food to the people with him. Then he got up, followed Elijah, and became his servant."

      "1": "A little while later, King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered an army of cavalry and chariots in a military confederacy with 32 kings, invaded Samaria, and set up siege encampments there.",
      "2": "Then he sent envoys to visit King Ahab of Israel and told him, “This is what Ben-hadad says:",
      "3": "‘Your silver and gold belong to me. So do the most beautiful of your wives and children.’”",
      "4": "“Whatever you want, your majesty,” the king of Israel answered. “I belong to you, as does everything I own.”",
      "5": "After delivering Ahab’s answer, the envoys returned with this message: “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I’ve sent my envoys to you to tell you that your silver, gold, wives, and children are to be given to me.",
      "6": "About this time tomorrow, I’ll send my servants to you, and they’ll search through your palace and your servants’ houses. Whatever is important to you will be seized and taken away.’”",
      "7": "Then the king of Israel called together all of the elders of the land and told them, “Please note that this man is here looking for trouble. He sent a message to me, demanding my wives, my children, and my silver and gold, and I haven’t refused him.”",
      "8": "“Don’t listen to him,” all the elders and the people replied. “And don’t agree to his terms.”",
      "9": "So he told Ben-hadad’s envoys, “Tell his majesty the king, ‘Everything that you asked for the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” So the envoys left to deliver Ahab’s response. They returned a little while later.",
      "10": "Beh-hadad sent this message back: “May the gods do so to me, and more than that also, if the dust that remains of Samaria is enough to fill up a few handfuls for all of the armies at my disposal.”",
      "11": "But the king of Israel replied, “Tell him, ‘The one who is starting to strap on his battle armor should never brag like the one who is taking it off.’”",
      "12": "Ben-hadad received Ahab’s response while he was celebrating with his kings in the battle pavilions. “Sound ‘Battle Stations!’” he ordered, and the army began to prepare their attack.",
      "13": "Right about then, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and told him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You see all of this great big army, do you? Well now, I’m going to deliver them all right into your hand, and you will learn that I am the Lord!’”",
      "14": "“By whom?” Ahab asked.\n“This is what the Lord says,” the prophet replied. “‘By the young men who serve as officials within the provinces.’”\n“Who is to begin the battle?” Ahab asked.\n“You,” the prophet answered.",
      "15": "So Ahab gathered together 232 young men who served as officials within the provinces and then mustered 7,000 soldiers from among the Israelis.",
      "16": "They attacked at noon, just as Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the battle pavilions, along with the 32 kings who had joined him.",
      "17": "The young men who served as officials within the provinces led the charge, and somebody informed Ben-hadad, “Some men have come out from Samaria.”",
      "18": "“Take them alive, whether they’ve come in peace or not,” he ordered.",
      "19": "Meanwhile, as the young men who served as officials within the provinces left the city, their army followed after them.",
      "20": "Each man struck down his opponent, and the Arameans ran away with Israel in pursuit. King Ben-hadad of Aram escaped on horseback with the help of his cavalry.",
      "21": "The king of Israel went out and attacked the cavalry and chariots and killed the Arameans in a massive victory.",
      "22": "The prophet approached the king of Israel and told him, “Go replenish your forces and prepare for the future, because early this next year the king of Aram will attack you again.”",
      "23": "Sure enough, the advisors to the king of Aram told him, “Their gods are mountain gods. That’s why they were stronger than we were. But when we fight them on the plains, we’re certain to be the stronger army!",
      "24": "So do this: remove the kings from command and replace them with captains.",
      "25": "Then replace the army that you lost, horse-for-horse and chariot-for-chariot. We’ll fight them on the plains, and we’re certain to be the stronger army.” Ben-hadad listened to what they had to say and carried out their advice.",
      "26": "Early the next year, Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and invaded Aphek in a battle against Israel.",
      "27": "The Israelis were mustered, equipped with provisions, and sent out to fight. The Israeli encampment looked like two little flocks of goats compared to how the Aramean encampments filled the countryside!",
      "28": "Right about then, a man of God approached and told the king of Israel, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because the Arameans keep saying “The Lord is a mountain god, but isn’t a valley god,” I’m going to deliver this entire vast army right into your control, so you’ll learn that I really am the Lord.’”",
      "29": "So they remained in opposing camps for seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle commenced, and the Israelis killed 100,000 Aramean infantry troops in a single day.",
      "30": "The rest of the Aramean army retreated into Aphek, but the city wall collapsed on 27,000 soldiers who had taken shelter there. Ben-hadad himself ran away and hid inside a closet somewhere in the city.",
      "31": "“Look, now,” his advisors suggested, “we’ve heard that the Israeli kings are merciful. So let’s clothe ourselves with sackcloth, tie our hair back with ropes, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he’ll spare your life.”",
      "32": "So they put on some sackcloth, tied their hair back with ropes, and approached the king of Israel. “Your servant Ben-hadad says this,” they said. “Please let me live.”\n“Is he still alive?” Ahab asked. “He’s my brother.”",
      "33": "Ben-hadad’s advisors, quickly analyzing the signs in what Ahab was saying, responded, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.”\n“Go get him,” Ahab responded. So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab took him up into his personal chariot.",
      "34": "Ben-hadad made this promise to Ahab: “I will restore the cities that my ancestors took from your ancestors. You’ll be able to build streets named after yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”\n“With this promise I will release you,” Ahab replied. So Ahab made a treaty with Ben-hadad and let him go.",
      "35": "Right about then, one of the members of the guild of prophets told another through a message from the Lord: “Please strike me!” But the man refused to do so,",
      "36": "so he told him, “Because you haven’t obeyed the Lord’s voice, as soon as you leave here, a lion will kill you.” As soon as the man left, a lion found him and killed him.",
      "37": "Later, he found another man and told him, “Please strike me!” So the man struck him and wounded him.",
      "38": "Then the prophet left and waited for the king to pass by, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.",
      "39": "As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and told him, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle, and a soldier turned aside, brought a prisoner to me, and told me, ‘Guard this man. If he turns up missing for any reason at all, you’ll pay for it with your life or be fined one talent of silver.’",
      "40": "While your servant was busy here and there, the prisoner escaped.”\nThe king told him, “By your actions you’ve earned the proper judgment!”",
      "41": "Then the prophet quickly tore off his bandage, and the king of Israel recognized him as being one of the prophets.",
      "42": "He told the king, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because you let the man whom I had dedicated to destruction go free, therefore your life is to be forfeited for his life, and your people for his people.’”",
      "43": "After hearing this, the king of Israel rode back to his palace in Samaria, frustrated and in a foul mood."

    "21": {
      "1": "Meanwhile, there was a man named Naboth from Jezreel who owned a vineyard that was located contiguous to King Ahab’s palace in Samaria.",
      "2": "Ahab addressed Naboth and asked him, “I would like to plant a vegetable garden near my house. Please exchange your vineyard with a better one from me, or if you’d rather have cash, I’ll buy it for its full value.”",
      "3": "But Naboth replied to Ahab, “No way! The Lord prohibits the sale to you of the inheritance of my ancestors!”",
      "4": "Ahab went back to his palace, sullen and in a foul mood, because Naboth the Jezreelite had turned down Ahab’s offer by saying, “I will not transfer my ancestors’ inheritance to you!” He laid down on his bed, curled up with his face to the wall, and refused to eat.",
      "5": "But his wife Jezebel went to him and asked him, “How is it that you’re so sullen and refusing to eat?”",
      "6": "“I asked Naboth the Jezreelite, ‘Sell me your vineyard for cash, or if you want, I’ll give you a better one in its place.’ But he refused. He told me, ‘I won’t give you my vineyard!’”",
      "7": "“Aren’t you the reigning king of Israel?” his wife Jezebel replied. “Get up, have a meal, and get ready to be happy. I’ll go get you the vineyard that Naboth the Jezreelite owns.”",
      "8": "So she wrote some memos in Ahab’s name, set his personal seal to them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.",
      "9": "In the memos, she wrote the following directives: “Proclaim a public fast and seat Naboth in the front row.",
      "10": "Seat two wicked men in front of him, and make them testify against him. Tell them to claim, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”",
      "11": "So the leading men of the city, along with the elders and nobles who lived there, did precisely what Jezebel had directed them to do. They followed the instructions that she had set forth in the memos:",
      "12": "They proclaimed a public fast and seated Naboth in the front row.",
      "13": "Two wicked men came in, sat down in front of them, and testified against Naboth in public, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.",
      "14": "Afterwards, they sent a message to Jezebel that said, “Naboth has been stoned. He’s dead.”",
      "15": "When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she told Ahab, “Get up and confiscate Naboth’s vineyard that he refused to sell you for cash. Naboth the Jezreelite isn’t alive anymore. He’s dead!”",
      "16": "So once he heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab got up, went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, and confiscated it.",
      "17": "That’s when this message from the Lord came to Elijah the foreigner:",
      "18": "“Get up and go down to meet King Ahab of Israel. He’s in Samaria. Look! He’s in Naboth’s vineyard, where he’s gone to confiscate it.",
      "19": "Ask the king, ‘Did you commit murder? And now you’re going to steal as well?’ Also tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Where the dogs were licking up Naboth’s blood, dogs will also lick up your blood—that’s right—yours!”’”",
      "20": "Later on, Ahab asked Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?”\nBut Elijah answered, “I’ve found you because you sold yourself to do what the Lord considers to be evil!",
      "21": "Now pay attention! I’m going to send evil in your direction! I will completely sweep you away and eliminate from Ahab every male, whether indentured servant or free, throughout Israel.",
      "22": "I will make your household resemble that of Nebat’s son Jeroboam, or like the household of Ahijah’s son Baasha, because of how you’ve provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin.",
      "23": "The Lord also has this to say about Jezebel: ‘Dogs will eat Jezebel within the outer ramparts of Jezreel.",
      "24": "Dogs will eat whoever belongs to Ahab and who dies in the city. The birds of the sky will eat whoever dies in the fields.’”",
      "25": "It can be truly said that no one else sold himself to practice what the Lord considered to be evil quite like the way Ahab did, because his wife Jezebel incited him.",
      "26": "His behavior in pursuing idolatry was detestable, just like the Amorites had done whom the Lord had expelled in front of the army of Israel.",
      "27": "Nevertheless, as soon as Ahab heard this message, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He even slept in sackcloth and wandered around meekly.",
      "28": "Later, this message from the Lord came to Elijah the foreigner:",
      "29": "“Have you noticed that Ahab has humbled himself in my presence? Because he has humbled himself in my presence, I will not bring his evil to harvest during his lifetime, but I will bring evil to his household during his son’s lifetime.”"

      "2": "During that third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit the king of Israel.",
      "3": "The king of Israel asked his servants, “Were you aware that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, but we aren’t doing anything to remove it from the control of the king of Aram?”",
      "4": "Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you join me in battle against Ramoth-gilead?”\n“I’m with you,” Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel. “My army will join yours, and my cavalry will be your cavalry.”",
      "5": "But Jehoshaphat also asked the king of Israel, “Please ask for a message from the Lord, first.”",
      "6": "So the king of Israel called in about 400 prophets and asked them, “Should we go attack Ramoth-gilead, or should I call off the attack?”\n“Go attack them,” they all said, “because the Lord will drop them right into the king’s hand!”",
      "7": "But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the Lord left here that we could talk to?”",
      "8": "“There is still one man left by whom we could ask the Lord what to do,” the king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, “but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me. Instead, he prophesies evil. He is Imla’s son Micaiah.”\nBut Jehoshaphat rebuked Ahab, “Kings should never talk like that.”",
      "9": "Nevertheless, the king of Israel called one of his officers and ordered him, “Bring me Imla’s son Micaiah quickly.”",
      "10": "Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were each sitting on their respective thrones, arrayed in their robes, on the threshing floor at the entrance to the city gate of Samaria, and all of the prophets were prophesying in front of them.",
      "11": "Chenaanah’s son Zedekiah made iron horns for himself and told them, “This is what the Lord says, ‘With these horns you are to gore the Arameans until they are eliminated!’”",
      "12": "All the other prophets were saying similar things, like “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!”",
      "13": "Meanwhile, the messenger who had gone off to summon Micaiah advised him, “Look, everything that the other prophets were saying was unanimously favorable to the king. So please, cooperate with them and speak favorably.”",
      "14": "“As the Lord lives,” Micaiah replied, “I’ll say what my God tells me to say.”",
      "15": "When Micaiah approached the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I not?”\n“Go to war,” Micaiah replied, “and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!”",
      "16": "When he heard this, the king asked him, “How many times do I have to make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth? Now do it in the name of the Lord!”",
      "17": "So Micaiah replied:\n“I saw all of Israel\n    scattered on the mountains\n        like sheep without a shepherd.\nAnd the Lord told me,\n    ‘These have no master,\n        so let them each return to his own home in peace.’”",
      "18": "Then the king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me, but only evil?”",
      "19": "But Micaiah responded, “Therefore, listen to what the Lord has to say. I saw the Lord, sitting on his throne, and the entire Heavenly Army was standing around him on his right hand and on his left hand.",
      "20": "“The Lord asked, ‘Who will tempt King Ahab of Israel to attack Ramoth-gilead, so that he will die there?’ And one was saying one thing and one was saying another.",
      "21": "“But then a spirit approached, stood in front of the Lord, and said, ‘I will entice him.’",
      "22": "“And the Lord asked him, ‘How?’\n“‘I will go,’ he announced, ‘and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets!’\n“So the Lord said, ‘You’re just the one to deceive him. You will be successful. Go and do it.’",
      "23": "“Now therefore, listen! The Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouth of all of these prophets of yours, because the Lord has determined to bring disaster upon you.”",
      "24": "Right then, Chenaanah’s son Zedekiah approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek. Then he asked him, “How did the Spirit of the Lord move from me to speak to you?”",
      "25": "Micaiah replied, “You’ll see how when the day comes that you run away to hide yourself in a closet!”",
      "26": "Then the king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and place him in the custody of Amon, the city governor. Hand him over to Joash, the king’s son.",

      "30": "The king of Israel suggested to Jehoshaphat, “I’ll go into battle in disguise, but you keep your royal uniform on.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and they both went into the battle.",
      "31": "Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to 32 of his chariot commanders: “Don’t attack unimportant soldiers or ranking officers. Go after only the king of Israel.”",
      "32": "So when the chariot commanders observed Jehoshaphat, they said by mistake, “It’s the king of Israel!” and they turned aside to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out.",

      "34": "Meanwhile, somebody drew his bow aimlessly and struck the king of Israel between the scales where his armor breastplates joined, so he instructed his chariot driver, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, because I’ve been severely wounded.”",
      "35": "The battle continued on for the rest of the day while the king of Israel was propped up in front of the Arameans until the sun set, at which time he died. The blood from Ahab’s wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot.",
      "36": "As the day drew to a close, this order was circulated throughout the army telling the soldiers, “Everybody go back to his city and to his own land.”",
      "37": "So the king died and was brought back to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.",
