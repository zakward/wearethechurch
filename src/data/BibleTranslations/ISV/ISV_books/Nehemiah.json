      "1": "In this document, I, Hacaliah’s son Nehemiah, recount what occurred during the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.\nIn the month of Chislev, while I was in Shushan at the palace,",
      "2": "Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, about those who had survived the Babylonian captivity, and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They told me, “The survivors of the captivity there in the province are living in great distress and shame. Furthermore, the Jerusalem wall remains broken down and its gates have been burned by fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard this, I sat down and cried, mourning for a number of days while I fasted and prayed in the presence of the God of Heaven.",
      "5": "I said, “Please, Lord, God of Heaven, the great and fearsome God who keeps the covenant, showing gracious love to those who love you and keep your commands,",
      "6": "please turn your attention to observe carefully and listen to the prayer of your servant today that I am presenting to you day and night on behalf of your servants, the Israelis.\n“I confess the sins that we Israelis have committed against you. Both I and my father’s house have sinned.",
      "7": "We have abandoned you by not keeping your commands, your ceremonies, and your judgments that you proscribed to your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Please remember what you spoke in commanding your servant Moses. You said,\n‘If you rebel, I will scatter you among the nations",
      "9": "but if you return to me, keeping my commands and doing them, even if your exiled people are in the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I have chosen to establish my Name.’",
      "10": "These are your servants as well as your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.",
      "11": "“And now, Lord, I ask you to listen to the prayer of your servant—and to the prayers of your servants who delight in revering your Name. I ask you, please prosper your servant today by granting him to receive favor from this man.”\nNow I was the king’s senior security advisor."

    "2": {
      "1": "It came about in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, during the month of Nissan, the king was about to drink some wine that I was preparing for him. Now I had never looked troubled in his presence.",
      "2": "The king asked me, “Why do you look so troubled, since you’re not ill? This cannot be anything else but troubles of the heart.”\nThen I was filled with fear.",
      "3": "I replied to the king, “May the king live forever. Why shouldn’t I be troubled, since the city where my ancestral sepulchers are located lies waste, with its gates burned by fire?”",
      "4": "The king answered, “What do you want?”\nSo I prayed to the God of heaven",
      "5": "and I replied to the king, “If it seems good to you, and if your servant has found favor with you, would you send me to Judah, to the city where my ancestral sepulchers are located, so I can rebuild it?”",
      "6": "With his queen seated beside him, the king asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” The king thought it was a good idea to send me, so I presented him with a prepared plan.",
      "7": "I also asked the king, “If it seems good to you, order that letters of authorization be given me for the Trans-Euphrates governors, so they will allow me to pass through to Judah,",
      "8": "along with a letter to Asaph, the royal Commissioner of Forests, so that he will supply me with timber to craft beams for the gatehouses of the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house in which I will be living.”\nThe king granted this for me, according to the good hand of my God.",
      "9": "So I went to the Trans-Euphrates governors and gave them the king’s letters of authorization. The king also sent army officers and cavalry to accompany me.",
      "10": "But when Sanballat the Horonite and his servant Tobiah the Ammonite heard of this, they were greatly distressed because someone had come to do good for the Israelis.",
      "11": "I arrived in Jerusalem and remained there for three days.",
      "12": "Then I got up at night, along with a few men with me. I had not confided to any person what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. Furthermore, there was no other animal with me except for the one I was riding.",
      "13": "So I went out during the night through the Valley Gate toward Dragon’s Well, and from there to the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and burned by fire.",
      "14": "I proceeded to the Fountain Gate, and then to the King’s Pool, but there wasn’t sufficient clearance for the animal I was riding to pass.",
      "15": "I traveled the valley by night to inspect the wall, returning through the Valley Gate.",
      "16": "The local officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done—I informed neither the Judeans, nor the priests, nor the nobles, nor the officials, nor any of the rest who would be doing the work.",
      "17": "Later I told them, “You all are watching the predicament we’re in, how Jerusalem lies desolate, with its gates burned by fire. Let’s rebuild the Jerusalem wall so we’re no longer a disgrace.”",
      "18": "Then I told them how good my God had been to me, and about what the king had told me.\nThey replied, “Let’s get out there and build!” So they encouraged themselves to do good.",
      "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, his servant Tobiah the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they jeered at us and despised us when they said, “What is this thing that you’re doing? You’re rebelling against the king, aren’t you?”",
      "20": "In reply to them, I said, “The God of Heaven will prosper us. That’s why we’re preparing to build. But as far as you’re concerned, there exists no ancestral heritage, no legal right, nor any historic claim in Jerusalem."

      "1": "So Eliashib the high priest came forward, along with his fellow priests, and reconstructed the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and installed its doors. They also consecrated the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.",
      "2": "Men from Jericho did repairs next to him, and Imri’s son Zaccur did repairs next to them.",

      "1": "When Sanballat heard that we were reconstructing the wall, he flew into a rage, became indignant, and mocked the Jews.",
      "2": "He addressed his allies and the Samaritan officials, saying “What are these pathetic Jews doing? Are they intending to rebuild it by themselves? Do they intend to offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a single day? Can they make stones from this burned out rubble?”",
      "3": "Tobiah the Ammonite stood to the side, commenting, “If a fox were to jump onto what they’re building, it would collapse their stone wall!”",
      "4": "“Listen, our God, because we are being mocked. Let their insults fall back on them, and let them be dragged away as captives into exile.",
      "5": "Don’t atone their iniquity, and don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you, because they have demoralized the builders.”",
      "6": "So we rebuilt the wall, completing it halfway up, because the people were committed to working.",
      "7": "But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair work on the Jerusalem wall was progressing and that its breaches were being repaired, they flew into a rage.",
      "8": "So they all conspired together to invade and fight against Jerusalem, creating confusion there.",
      "9": "But we prayed to our God. We also set up guards day and night because of them.",
      "10": "Meanwhile, the people of Judah said, “The builders are tired and there’s so much rubble that we can’t reconstruct the wall!”",
      "11": "Our enemies said, “Before they notice or see us, we’ll penetrate their midst, kill them, and stop the work!”",
      "12": "The Jews who lived near them kept coming to us, reporting at least ten times, “They’ll attack us from every direction.”",
      "13": "So I stationed the people by families behind the wall in the lower exposed areas, equipping them with their swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "Looking things over, I stood up and spoke to the officials, the military leaders, and the rest of the people: “Don’t fear them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord. Fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”",
      "15": "Our opponents heard that we had learned about them, that God had brought their plans to failure, and that each and every one of us had come to work on the wall.",
      "16": "From that day on, half of my helpers engaged in the work while the other half kept spears, shields, bows, and armor ready. The senior officials backed all of the Judeans",
      "17": "who worked on the wall. Those who carried building materials worked with one hand, carrying a spear in the other.",
      "18": "Each builder worked with a sword strapped to his side, while a trumpeter remained beside me to sound an alarm.",
      "19": "I told the officials, rulers, and the rest of the people, “The project is large and extensive, and we are separated from each other on the wall,",
      "20": "so wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come over to us, and our God will fight for us!”",
      "21": "So we worked hard, half of us holding spears from dawn to dusk.",
      "22": "At the same time I told the people, “Let’s have everyone sleep at night inside Jerusalem with their servants, so they can guard us at night and work during the day.",
      "23": "No one—neither I, my allies, my servants, nor the bodyguards who accompanied me—changed clothes. Everyone carried a weapon even while going for water."

      "1": "Now the people along with their spouses complained loudly against their fellow Jews,",
      "2": "because certain of them kept claiming, “Since we have so many sons and daughters, we must get some grain so we can eat and survive.”",
      "3": "Others were saying, “We’re having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our homes so we can buy grain during this famine.”",
      "4": "Still others were saying “We’ve borrowed money against our fields and vineyards to pay the king’s taxes.",
      "5": "Now our bodies are no different than the bodies of our relatives, and our children are like their children. Nevertheless, we’re about to force our sons and daughters into slavery, and some of our daughters are already in bondage. It’s beyond our power to do anything about it, because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "I became very livid when I heard their complaining and these charges.",
      "7": "So after thinking it over carefully, I accused the officials and nobles openly, “Every one of you is charging your fellow countrymen interest!” So I opened a public investigation against them.",
      "8": "I accused them, “To the best of our ability, we’ve been buying back our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners. Even now you’re selling your fellow countrymen, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet and never spoke a word.",
      "9": "So I said, “What you’re doing isn’t right! Shouldn’t you live in the fear of our God to avoid shame from our foreign enemies?",
      "10": "I’m also lending money and grain, as are my fellow-Jews and my servants, but let’s not charge interest.",
      "11": "So today please restore to them their fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and homes, along with the one percent interest charge that you’ve assessed them on the grain, wine, and oil.”",
      "12": "They responded, “We will restore these things, and will assess no interest charges against them. We will do what you are requesting!”\nSo I called the priests and made them take an oath to fulfill this promise.",
      "13": "I also shook my robes, and said, “May God shake out every man from his house and his possessions who does not keep this promise. May he be emptied out and shaken just like this.”\nAll the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. And the people kept their promise.",
      "14": "In addition, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah (that is, during the twelve years from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes), neither I nor my relatives relied on the provisions allotted to the governor.",
      "15": "Nevertheless, the former governors before me placed a heavy burden on the people. They received food and wine, plus a tax of 40 shekels of silver. Even their young men took advantage of the people, but I never did so because I feared God.",
      "16": "Also, as I continued to work on the wall, we purchased no land, and all of my young men were employed in the work.",
      "17": "I fed 150 Jews and officials every day, not counting those who came from the nations around us.",
      "18": "Our daily requirements were one ox and six choice sheep, along with various kinds of poultry prepared for me. Every ten days there was a delivery of an abundant supply of wine. Despite all this, I refused the governor’s allotment, because demands on the people were heavy.",
      "19": "“Remember me with favor, my God, for everything I’ve done for this people.”"
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had completed the wall and that no break remained in it (even though by that time I hadn’t yet installed the doors in the gates),",
      "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me, saying “Come, let’s meet together at Kephirim on the Ono Plain.” But they were just trying to do me harm.",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, replying “I am involved in a great endeavor, so I can’t leave. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?”",
      "4": "They sent me this message four times, and I answered them the same way.",
      "5": "Then Sanballat sent his assistant to me the fifth time. But this time the letter was sent unsealed, and",
      "6": "in it was written:\nIt is reported among the nations—and Gashmu confirms this—that you and the Jews are planning a revolt, and that you’re rebuilding the wall in order to declare yourself king. According to these reports,",
      "7": "you also have appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Jerusalem, “There is a king in Judah!” Since these words are being reported to the king, come and let’s meet together.",
      "8": "I sent word back to him, “Nothing has happened as you’ve claimed. You’re making up these charges in your imagination.”",
      "9": "For they all were trying to make us afraid by saying, “Their hands will become tired from laboring, so the work won’t be completed.”\n“Therefore, Lord, strengthen my hands!”",
      "10": "Later I visited Delaiah’s son Shemaiah, a grandson of Mehetabel, who was confined at home. He kept urging me, “Let’s meet together at the house of God, within the Temple, and take refuge there, because they’re coming to kill you. In fact, they’re coming at night to kill you!”",
      "11": "But I asked him, “Should a man like me run? Should someone like me run into the Temple to save his life? I won’t go there!”",
      "12": "I perceived that God had not sent him. Instead, Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to pronounce this prophecy against me.",
      "13": "He had been hired to make me afraid so I would sin by doing what he suggested. Then they could create a slanderous report to use against me.",
      "14": "“Remember me, my God, and take note of what Tobiah and Sanballat are doing. Also take note of the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who intend to make me afraid.”",
      "15": "So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul in 52 days.",
      "16": "When all of our enemies—including the surrounding nations—heard this, they became very discouraged, since they saw that the work had been done by our God.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, at that time the nobles of Judah continued to send many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah kept sending letters to them.",
      "18": "For many Judeans had sworn allegiance to him, since he was son-in-law to Arah’s son Shecaniah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Berechiah’s son Meshullam.",
      "19": "Furthermore, they kept reporting Tobiah’s good deeds to me, and kept repeating what I told him. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "After the wall had been completed and its doors installed, then the gatekeepers, singers, and descendants of Levi were appointed.",
      "2": "I appointed my brother Hanani and fortress commander Hananiah to be over Jerusalem, since he was a faithful person who revered God more than many others did.",
      "3": "I charged them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until mid-day. Until then, let everyone stand watch, keeping the gates shut and locked. Appoint security watches from those who live in Jerusalem. Everyone should maintain his own watch near his house.”",
      "4": "Even though the city was large and spread out, not many people were living there and not many houses had been built.",
      "5": "So my God gave me the idea to gather together the nobles, the officials, and the people so they could be registered according to their genealogies.\nI found a register of the original inhabitants in which there was recorded",
      "6": "a list of descendants of the province of Judah who returned from captivity, from those who had been exiled by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They had come back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his town.",
