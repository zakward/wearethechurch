      "1": "This is a record of what happened during the reign of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.",
      "2": "At that time King Ahasuerus was ruling from Susa the capital.",
      "3": "In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his officials and ministers, and the military leaders of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the provincial officials were present.",
      "4": "He displayed the enormous wealth of his kingdom, along with its splendid beauty and greatness for many days—for 180 days in all.",
      "5": "When those days were over, the king held a seven-day banquet in the courtyard of the garden of his palace for all the people who were present in Susa the capital, from the greatest to the least important.",
      "6": "There were curtains of white and blue linen tied with cords of fine linen and purple material to silver rings on marble columns. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other precious stones.",
      "7": "Drinks were served in gold vessels of various kinds, and there was plenty of royal wine because the king was generous.",
      "8": "According to the king’s decree the drinking was not compulsory because the king instructed every steward in his house to serve each individual what he desired.",
      "9": "Queen Vashti also held a banquet in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus for the women.",
      "10": "A week later, when the king was under the influence of all that wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasuerus,",
      "11": "to bring Queen Vashti to the king, wearing the royal crown to display her beauty to the people and the officials, since she was lovely to look at.",
      "12": "Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s order that was brought by the eunuchs.\nThen the king flew into a rage.",
      "13": "The king spoke to the wise men who understood the times, for it was the king’s custom to consult all those who understood law and justice.",
      "14": "(His closest advisors were: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had direct access to the king and who held the highest rank in the kingdom.)",
      "15": "The king inquired, “According to law, what should be done to Queen Vashti because she did not obey the order of King Ahasuerus that was delivered by the eunuchs?”",
      "16": "Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and his officials, “It is not the king alone whom Vashti has wronged, but rather all of the officials and all of the people who are in the provinces of King Ahasuerus.",
      "17": "When the report about the queen goes out to all the women, it will cause them to despise their husbands. They’ll say, ‘King Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she wouldn’t come.’",
      "18": "This very day the wives of the officials of Persia and Media who hear the report about the queen will speak in the same way to all the officials of the king, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger.",
      "19": "If it seems good to the king, let a royal decree go out from him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her royal position to another woman who is better than she.",
      "20": "When the edict of the king that he issues is heard throughout his kingdom—for it’s vast—then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the greatest to the least important.”",
      "21": "This seemed like a good idea to the king and his officials, so the king did what Memucan suggested.",
      "22": "He sent letters to all the provinces of the king, written in the script of that province, and to each people in their own language, ordering that every man should be the master in his house and speak the language of his own people."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "After this, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed about her.",
      "2": "Then the young men who attended the king suggested, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.",
      "3": "Let the king appoint officials in all the provinces of his kingdom to bring all the beautiful young virgins into the harem in Susa the capital. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women to give them their beauty treatments.",
      "4": "Then let the young woman who pleases the king rule in place of Vashti.” This advice pleased the king, and he did this.",
      "5": "In Susa the capital there was a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin, Jair’s son Mordecai, who was a descendant of Kish’s son Shimei the descendant of Benjamin.",
      "6": "He had been taken into captivity from Jerusalem along with the exiles who had been deported with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon had taken into exile.",
      "7": "Mordecai had raised his cousin Hadassah, or Esther, because she had no father or mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was very attractive. After her mother and father died, Mordecai had taken her as his daughter.",
      "8": "The king’s order and edict was proclaimed, and many young women were brought to Susa the capital under the care of Hegai. Esther was taken to the palace into the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.",
      "9": "The young woman pleased him and gained his favor. He quickly provided her beauty treatments and gave her portions of food to her. He also assigned her seven suitable young women from the palace and transferred her and her young women to the best place in the harem.",
      "10": "Esther did not make known her people or heritage because Mordecai had instructed her not to make it known.",
      "11": "Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem to find out about Esther’s well-being and what was happening to her.",
      "12": "Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus at the end of the twelve month period, at which time she was treated according to the regulations for women. This process completed the period of her beauty treatments—six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and cosmetics for women.",
      "13": "After that the young woman would go in to the king, and whatever she asked for would be given to her to take with her from the harem to the palace.",
      "14": "In the evening she would go into the palace and in the morning she would return to the second harem, into the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the mistresses. She would not go again to the king unless the king wanted her and she was called for by name.",
      "15": "Now Esther was the daughter of Abihail, who had been Mordecai’s uncle. Mordecai had taken Esther in as his own daughter. When her turn came to go in to the king, she did not want anything except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the harem, advised. Esther found favor with everyone who saw her.",
      "16": "Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.",
      "17": "The king loved Esther more than any of the other women, so he favored her and was kinder to her than he was to any of the other virgins. He put the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.",
      "18": "The king put on a great banquet for all his officials and ministers to honor Esther. He declared a holiday for the provinces and gave generous gifts.",
      "19": "When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.",
      "20": "Now Esther had not declared her heritage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her, for Esther did what Mordecai told her just as she had done when she was raised by him.",
      "21": "At that time when Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs among those who guarded the threshold, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus.",
      "22": "When Mordecai learned about the plot, he told Queen Esther, and she told the king in Mordecai’s name.",
      "23": "After the matter had been fully investigated, Bigthan and Teresh were hanged on a pole, and this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Sometime later King Ahasuerus promoted Hammedatha the Agagite’s son Haman, elevating him to a position above all the other officials who were with him.",
      "2": "All the king’s ministers who were in the king’s gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, because the king had commanded that Haman be honored in this way. Mordecai, however, would not kneel and would not bow down.",
      "3": "The king’s ministers who were in the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?”",
      "4": "They asked him this day after day, and he would not listen to them, so they told Haman to see whether or not Mordecai would get away with his disobedience, since he also had told them that he was Jewish.",
      "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel and bow down to him, he flew into a rage.",
      "6": "Because they had told him who the people of Mordecai were, Haman found it unacceptable to kill only Mordecai. So Haman sought to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jewish people, who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.",
      "7": "In the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, in the first month (the month Nisan), the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in Haman’s presence to determine the best day and month to carry out his plot. The lot indicated the twelfth month, the month Adar.",
      "8": "Then Haman told King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and divided among the people throughout the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different than all the other people, they don’t obey the king’s laws, and it’s not in the king’s best interest to leave them alone.",
      "9": "If the king approves, let it be decreed that they’re to be destroyed, and I’ll measure out 10,000 silver talents and bring it to the king’s treasury for those who will do the work.”",
      "10": "The king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Hammedatha the Agagite’s son Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people.",
      "11": "The king told Haman, “The silver is given to you, along with the people, to do with them as you see fit.”",
      "12": "The king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and all that Haman commanded was written to the regional authorities of the king, to the governors who were over each province, and to the officials of each people. This order was translated in the name of King Ahasuerus into the language of each province and bore the seal of the king’s signet ring.",
      "13": "Letters were sent by couriers to all of the king’s provinces to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all the Jewish people, both young and old, women and children, and to confiscate their goods on a single day—the thirteenth day of the twelfth month of Adar.",
      "14": "A copy of the letter was to be issued as an edict in every province and published to all the people, telling them to be ready for that day.",
      "15": "The couriers went out, urged on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in Susa the capital. The king and Haman sat down to drink, while the city of Susa was thrown into confusion."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his garments and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes. He went into the middle of the city and cried out with a loud and bitter cry.",
      "2": "He came as far as the front of the king’s gate, because no one was allowed to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth.",
      "3": "In every province where the order of the king and his edict reached, among the Jewish people there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and lamenting, and many lay down on sackcloth and ashes.",
      "4": "When Esther’s young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was greatly distressed. She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on so he could take off the sackcloth that he had on, but he would not take them.",
      "5": "Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had assigned to her, and she ordered him to go to Mordecai to find out what was happening and why it was happening.",
      "6": "Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king’s gate.",
      "7": "Mordecai told him everything that had happened and the exact amount of money that Haman had said he would pay into the king’s treasury in order to destroy the Jewish people.",
      "8": "Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the written decree ordering the Jews’ destruction that had been issued in Susa. Mordecai wanted him to show it to Esther, to explain it to her, and then to instruct her to go in to the king to seek his favor and plead with him for her people.",
      "9": "Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.",
      "10": "Then Esther spoke to Hathach, instructing him to go back to Mordecai with this message:",
      "11": "“Every servant of the king and every person in the king’s provinces knows that for any man or woman who goes to the king in the inner court without being summoned there is only one law—that he be put to death—unless the king holds out the golden scepter to him. Only then he will live. For these last 30 days I’ve not been summoned to come to the king.”",
      "12": "They reported Esther’s message to Mordecai.",
      "13": "Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Don’t suppose that because you are in the palace, you will escape any more than the other Jewish people.",
      "14": "Indeed, if you are silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. Who knows but that you were brought to the kingdom for a time like this?”",
      "15": "Then Esther replied to Mordecai,",
      "16": "“Go and gather all the Jewish people who are in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, night or day. Both I and my young women will also fast in the same way, and then I’ll go in to the king, even though it’s against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”",
      "17": "Then Mordecai left and did everything that Esther had ordered him."

    "5": {
      "1": "On the third day, Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace in front of the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the building.",
      "2": "When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she won his favor, and the king extended to Esther the gold scepter that he was holding. Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.",
      "3": "The king asked her, “What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even if it’s half of the kingdom, it will be given to you.”",
      "4": "Esther replied, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet I’ve prepared for him.”",
      "5": "The king responded, “Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther has requested.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.",
      "6": "While they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther, “What’s your petition? It will be given to you. What’s your request? Up to half of the kingdom, and it will be done.”",
      "7": "Esther answered, “This is my petition and my request:",
      "8": "If I’ve found favor with the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to honor my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I’ll prepare for them tomorrow, and then I’ll do what the king has said.”",
      "9": "Haman went out that day pleased and happy, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and that he did not stand up and tremble in his presence, Haman was furious with Mordecai.",
      "10": "Haman restrained himself, went to his house, and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.",
      "11": "Then Haman told them about his splendid wealth, the number of his sons, all the ways the king had honored him, and that he had promoted him above all the other officials and ministers of the king.",
      "12": "Then Haman said, “Even Queen Esther brought no one except me with the king to the banquet that she held. Furthermore, I (along with the king) have also been invited by her tomorrow.",
      "13": "But all this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”",
      "14": "Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said, “Have a pole made 50 cubits high, and then in the morning speak to the king and have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet happy.” This advice pleased Haman, and he had the pole made."

      "3": "So the king asked, “What honor and distinction was bestowed on Mordecai for this?”\nThe young men who served the king answered, “Nothing was done for him.”",
      "4": "The king said, “Who is in the courtyard?” Now Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the pole he had set up.",
      "5": "The king’s young men told him, “Look, Haman is standing in the courtyard.”\nThe king said, “Let him come in.”",

      "7": "Haman answered the king, “For a man whom the king desires to honor,",
      "8": "let them bring royal robes that the king has worn and a horse on which the king has ridden, with a royal crown placed on its head.",
      "9": "Then give the robes and the horse to one of the king’s most noble officials. Let them put the robes on the man whom the king desires to honor, and let them put him on the horse in the main square of the city. Then let them announce in front of him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honor.’”",
      "10": "Then the king told Haman, “Quick! Take the clothes and the horse just as you have suggested and do this for Mordecai the Jew who sits in the king’s gate. And don’t let anything you’ve suggested fall through the cracks.”",
      "11": "So Haman took the clothes and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and put him on the horse in the main square of the city. He cried out in front of him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honor.”",
      "12": "Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, while Haman hurried to his house, mourning and hiding his face.",
      "13": "Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His wise friends and his wife Zeresh told him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is one of the Jewish people, you won’t prevail against him. Instead, you will surely fall before him.”",
      "14": "While they were still talking to him, the king’s eunuchs arrived, and they quickly took him to the banquet that Esther had prepared."

      "3": "Queen Esther answered: “If I’ve found favor with you, your majesty, and if it seems good to the king, let my life be given to me as my petition and my people as my request.",
      "4": "Indeed, I and my people have been sold to be annihilated, killed, and destroyed. If we had just been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because the trouble wouldn’t have been sufficient to bother the king.”",

      "6": "Esther replied, “An adversary and an enemy—it’s this wicked Haman!” So Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.",
      "7": "The king got up from the banquet in anger and went out to the palace garden, while Haman stood there begging Queen Esther to spare his life, because he realized that the king intended to harm him.",
      "8": "When the king returned to the banquet hall from the palace garden, Haman was prostrate on the couch where Esther was. The king asked, “Will this man even assault the queen with me in the house?” The king had no sooner spoken than they covered Haman’s face.",
      "9": "Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, observed, “Look there! A pole is standing 50 cubits high at Haman’s house that he prepared for Mordecai, whose report benefitted the king!”\nThe king said, “Hang him on it.”",
