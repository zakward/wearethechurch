    "1": {
      "1": "This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.",
      "2": "As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,\n“See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way.",
      "3": "He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:\n    ‘Prepare the way for the Lord!\n        Make his paths straight!’”",
      "4": "John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism about repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
      "5": "People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins.",
      "6": "Now John was dressed in camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate grasshoppers and wild honey.",
      "7": "He kept proclaiming, “The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.",
      "8": "I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
      "11": "Then a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”",
      "12": "At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.",
      "13": "He was in the wilderness for 40 days being tempted by Satan. He was among wild animals, and angels were ministering to him.",
      "14": "Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God.",
      "15": "He said, “The time is now! The kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing the gospel!”",
      "16": "While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.",
      "17": "Jesus told them, “Follow me, and I’ll make you fishers of people!”",
      "18": "So immediately they left their nets and followed him.",
      "19": "Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets.",
      "20": "He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
      "21": "Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbaths, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
      "22": "The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one with authority, and not like their scribes.",
      "23": "All of a sudden, there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit! He screamed,",
      "24": "“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "But Jesus rebuked him. “Be quiet,” he ordered, “and come out of him!”",
      "26": "At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.",
      "27": "All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!”",
      "28": "At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.",
      "29": "After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.",
      "30": "Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her.",
      "31": "He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.",
      "32": "When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him everyone who was sick or possessed by demons.",
      "33": "In fact, the whole city gathered at the door.",
      "34": "He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn’t allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was.",
      "35": "In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there.",
      "36": "Simon and his companions searched frantically for him.",
      "37": "When they found him, they told him, “Everyone’s looking for you.”",
      "38": "“Let’s go to the neighboring town,” he replied, “so I can preach there, too, because that’s why I came.”",
      "39": "So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.",
      "40": "Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and told him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”",
      "41": "Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and told him, “I do want to. Be made clean!”",
      "42": "Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.",
      "43": "Then Jesus sternly warned him and encouraged him to go at once.",
      "44": "He told the man, “Be sure that you don’t tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”",
      "45": "But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere."

    "2": {
      "1": "Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum and it was reported that he was at home.",
      "2": "Such a large crowd gathered that there wasn’t room for them, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking his message to them",
      "3": "when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men.",
      "4": "Since they couldn’t bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he told the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,",
      "7": "“Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
      "8": "At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. “Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?” he asked them.",
      "9": "“Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?",
      "10": "But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins…” Then he told the paralyzed man,",
      "11": "“I say to you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home!”",
      "12": "So the man got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of all of them.\nAs a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God as they kept on saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
      "13": "Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them.",
      "14": "As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector’s desk. Jesus told him, “Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.",
      "15": "Later, he was having dinner at Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, because there were many who were following him.",
      "16": "When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard that, he told them, “Healthy people don’t need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”",
      "18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”",
      "19": "Jesus replied, “The wedding guests can’t fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can’t fast.",
      "20": "But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.”",
      "21": "“No one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. If he does, the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and a worse tear is made.",
      "22": "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins.”",
      "23": "Jesus happened to be going through the grain fields on a Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain.",
      "24": "The Pharisees asked him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on Sabbath days?”",
      "25": "He asked them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?",
      "26": "How was it that he went into the House of God during the lifetime of Abiathar the high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”",
      "27": "Then he told them, “The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Jesus went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there.",
      "2": "The people watched Jesus closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.",
      "3": "He told the man with the paralyzed hand, “Come forward.”",
      "4": "Then he asked them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on Sabbath days, to save a life or to destroy it?” But they remained silent.",
      "5": "Jesus looked around at them in anger, deeply hurt because of their hard hearts. Then he told the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand was restored to health.",
      "6": "Immediately the Pharisees and Herodians went out and began to plot how to kill him.",
      "7": "So Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,",
      "8": "Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing.",
      "9": "Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn’t crush him,",
      "10": "because he had healed so many people that everyone who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him.",
      "11": "Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was.",
      "13": "Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to himself those whom he had decided on, and they approached him.",
      "14": "He appointed the Twelve, whom he called apostles, to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,",
      "15": "and to have the authority to drive out demons.",
      "16": "He appointed the Twelve: Simon (whom he named Peter),",
      "17": "Zebedee’s sons James and his brother John (whom he named Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),",
      "18": "Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Cananaean,",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.",
      "20": "Then he went home. Such a large crowd gathered again that Jesus and his disciples couldn’t even eat.",
      "21": "When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him, because they kept saying, “He’s out of his mind!”",
      "22": "The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”",
      "23": "So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables. “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "And if a household is divided against itself, that household won’t stand.",
      "26": "So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.",
      "27": "No one can go into a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.",
      "28": "I tell all of you with certainty, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.",
      "29": "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is guilty of eternal sin.”",
      "30": "…because they had been saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "Then his mother and his brothers arrived. Milling around outside, they sent for him, continuously summoning him.",
      "32": "A crowd was sitting around him. They told him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”",
      "33": "He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”",
      "34": "Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!",
      "35": "Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Jesus began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore.",
      "2": "He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said,",
      "3": "“Listen! A farmer went out to sow.",
      "4": "As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.",
      "5": "Others fell on stony ground, where they didn’t have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once, because the soil wasn’t deep.",
      "6": "But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they didn’t have any roots, they dried up.",
      "7": "Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes came up and choked them out, and they didn’t produce anything.",
      "8": "But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced 30, 60, or 100 times what was sown.”",
      "9": "He added, “Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”",
      "10": "When he was alone with the Twelve and those around him, they began to ask him about the parables.",
      "11": "He told them, “The secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables",
      "12": "so that\n‘they may see clearly but not perceive,\n    and they may hear clearly but not understand,\n        otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.’”",
      "13": "Then he told them, “You don’t understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables?",
      "14": "The farmer sows the word.",
      "15": "Some people are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
      "16": "Others are like the seeds sown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, at once they joyfully accept it,",
      "17": "but since they don’t have any roots, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away.",
      "18": "Still others are like the seeds sown among the thorn bushes. These are the people who hear the word,",
      "19": "but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can’t produce a crop.",
      "20": "Others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops—30, 60, or 100 times what was sown.”",
      "21": "Then Jesus told them, “A lamp isn’t brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? It’s to be put on a lamp stand, isn’t it?",
      "22": "Nothing is hidden except for the purpose of having it revealed, and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light.",
      "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!",
      "24": "He went on to say to them, “Pay attention to what you’re hearing! You will be evaluated by the same standard with which you do your evaluating, and still more will be given to you,",
      "25": "because whoever has something, will have more given to him. But whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.”",
      "26": "He was also saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.",
      "27": "He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow, although he doesn’t know how",
      "28": "the ground produces grain by itself—first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.",
      "29": "But when the grain is ripe, he immediately starts cutting with his sickle because the harvest time has come.”",
      "30": "He was also saying, “How can we show what the kingdom of God is like, or what parable can we use to describe it?",
      "31": "It’s like a mustard seed planted in the ground. Although it’s the smallest of all the seeds on earth,",
      "32": "when it’s planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.”",
      "33": "With many other parables like these, Jesus kept speaking his message to them according to their ability to understand.",
      "34": "He did not tell them anything without using a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private.",
      "35": "That day, when evening had come, he told them, “Let’s cross to the other side.”",
      "36": "So they left the crowd and took him away in a boat without making any special preparations. Other boats were with him.",
      "37": "A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly becoming swamped.",
      "38": "But Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and asked him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to die?”",
      "39": "Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and told the sea, “Calm down! Be still!” Then the wind stopped blowing, and there was a great calm.",
      "40": "He asked them, “Why are you such cowards? Don’t you have any faith yet?”",
      "41": "Overcome with fear, they kept saying to one another, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes.",
      "2": "Just as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.",
      "3": "He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain.",
      "4": "He had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him.",
      "5": "He kept screaming night and day among the tombs and on the mountainsides, and kept cutting himself with stones.",
      "6": "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him,",
      "7": "screaming in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you in the name of God never to torment me!”",
      "8": "Jesus had been saying to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”",
      "9": "Then Jesus asked him, “What’s your name?”\nHe told him, “My name is Legion, because there are many of us.”",
      "10": "He kept pleading with Jesus not to send them out of that region.",
      "11": "Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby.",
      "12": "So the demons begged him, “Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!”",
      "13": "So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down a steep slope into the sea and drowned there.",
      "14": "Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened in the city and countryside. So the people went to see what had happened.",
      "15": "When they came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.",
      "16": "The people who had seen it told them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.",
      "17": "So they began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.",
      "18": "As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging him to let him go with him.",
      "19": "But Jesus wouldn’t let him. Instead, he told him, “Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.”",
      "20": "So the man left and began proclaiming in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was utterly amazed.",
      "21": "When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat, a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.",
      "22": "Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet",
      "23": "and begged him urgently, saying, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”",
      "24": "So Jesus went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him.",
      "25": "Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years.",
      "26": "Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all, but rather grew worse.",
      "27": "Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe,",
      "28": "because she had been saying, “If I can just touch his robe, I will get well.”",
      "29": "Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness.",
      "30": "Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”",
      "31": "His disciples asked him, “You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”",
      "32": "But he kept looking around to look at the woman who had done this.",
      "33": "So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came forward fearfully, fell down trembling in front of him, and told him the whole truth.",
      "34": "He told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your illness.”",
      "35": "While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader’s home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?”",
      "36": "But when Jesus heard what they said, he told the synagogue leader, “Stop being afraid! Just keep on believing.”",
      "37": "Jesus allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.",
      "38": "When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw mass confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly.",
      "39": "He entered the house and asked them, “Why all this confusion and crying? The child isn’t dead. She’s sleeping.”",
      "40": "They laughed and laughed at him. But when he had driven all of them outside, he took the child’s father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room where the child was.",
      "41": "He took her by the hand and told her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Young lady, I tell you, get up!”",
      "42": "The young lady got up at once and started to walk. She was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment.",
      "43": "But Jesus strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.",
      "2": "When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. “Where did this man get all these things?” they asked. “What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!",
      "3": "This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn’t it? His sisters are here with us, aren’t they?” And they were offended by him.",
      "4": "Jesus had been telling them, “A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home.”",
      "5": "He couldn’t perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.",
      "6": "He was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching.",
      "7": "He called the Twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.",
      "8": "He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick—no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag.",
      "9": "They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt.",
      "10": "He told them repeatedly, “Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you leave that place.",
      "11": "If any place will not welcome you and the people refuse to listen to you, when you leave, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”",
      "12": "So they went and preached that people should repent.",
      "13": "They also kept driving out many demons and anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them.",
      "14": "King Herod heard about this, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That’s why he is able to do these miracles.”",
      "15": "Others were saying, “He is Elijah.”\nStill others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”",
      "16": "But when Herod heard about it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised,”",
      "17": "because Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom Herod had married.",
      "18": "John had been telling Herod, “It’s not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”",
