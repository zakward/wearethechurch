      "2": "The next day, a man escaped from Saul’s camp! With torn clothes and dirty hair, he approached David, fell to the ground, and bowed down to him.",
      "3": "David asked him, “Where did you come from?\nHe answered him, “I just escaped from Israel’s encampment.”",
      "4": "David continued questioning him, “How did things go? Please tell me!”\nHe replied, “The army has fled the battlefield, many of the army are wounded or have died, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”",
      "5": "David asked the young man who related the story, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "The young man who had been relating the story answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa and there was Saul, leaning on his spear! Meanwhile, the chariots and horsemen were rapidly drawing near.",
      "7": "Saul glanced behind him, saw me, and called out to me, so I replied, ‘Here I am!’",
      "8": "He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ So I answered him, ‘I’m an Amalekite!’",
      "9": "He begged me, ‘Please—come stand here next to me and kill me, because I’m still alive.’",
      "10": "So I stood next to him and killed him, because I knew that he wouldn’t live after he had fallen. I took the crown that had been on his head, along with the bracelet that had been on his arm, and I have brought them to your majesty.”",
      "11": "On hearing this, David grabbed his clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were attending to him.",
      "12": "They mourned and wept, and then decided to fast until dusk for Saul, for his son Jonathan, for the army of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen in battle.",
      "13": "Meanwhile, David asked the young man who had told him the story, “Where are you from?”\nHe answered, “I’m an Amalekite, the son of a foreign man.”",
      "14": "At this David asked him, “How is it that you weren’t afraid to raise your hand to strike the Lord’s anointed?”",
      "15": "Then David called out to one of his young men and ordered him, “Go up to him and cut him down!” So he attacked him and killed him.",
      "16": "David told him, “Your blood is on your own head, because your own words testified against you! After all, you said, ‘I myself have killed the Lord’s anointed!’”",
      "17": "So David intoned this song of lament about Saul and his son Jonathan,",
      "18": "and he gave orders to teach the descendants of Judah the art of warfare, as is recorded in the Book of Jashar:",

      "20": "Don’t make it known in Gath!\n    Don’t declare it in the avenues of Ashkelon!\nOtherwise, the daughters of Philistia will rejoice;\n    and the daughters of the uncircumcised will triumph.",
      "21": "Mountains of Gilboa,\n    let no dew or rain fall on you,\n        and may none of your fields be filled with plenty,\nbecause in that place the shield of the valiant ones was defiled,\n    the shield of Saul without an anointing with oil.",
      "22": "From the blood of the slain,\n    from the blood of the valiant,\nJonathan’s bow would not retreat\n    nor would Saul’s sword return empty.",
      "23": "Saul and Jonathan, loved and handsome in life,\n    in death were not separated.\nSwifter than eagles they were,\n    and more valiant than lions.",
      "24": "Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul!\n    He clothed you in scarlet luxury\n        and decorated your garments with gold.",
      "25": "How have the valiant fallen in the tumult of battle!\n    Jonathan lies slain on your high places.",
      "26": "I am in distress for you, my brother Jonathan.\n    You have been most kind to me.\nYour love for me was extraordinary—\n    beyond love from women.",

      "2": "So David went there, along with his two wives Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, widow of Nabal from Carmel.",
      "3": "David brought his army with him, each soldier accompanied by his household, and they settled in the cities of Hebron.",
      "4": "After this, the army of Judah arrived, and they anointed David king over the house of Judah.\nThere they informed David, “The men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul.”",
      "5": "So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead and told them, “May the Lord bless you, because you showed gracious love like this to your lord Saul by burying him.",
      "6": "Now may the Lord reward you with gracious love, as well as faithfulness, to you, too! And I will also reward you because you did this good thing.",

      "9": "He installed him as king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all of the rest of Israel.",
      "10": "Ish-bosheth began to reign over Israel at the age of 40 years, and he reigned for two years, even though Judah’s lineage followed David.",

      "12": "Ner’s son Abner and the servants of Saul’s son Ish-bosheth set out from Mahanaim for Gibeon.",
      "13": "Zeruiah’s son Joab and some of David’s staff went out to meet them at the pool of Gibeon. One side encamped on one side of the pool while the other encamped on the other side of the pool.",
      "14": "Abner told Joab, “Let’s have the young men get up and fight in our presence.”\nJoab replied, “Let them come.”",
      "15": "So they got up and twelve were counted to represent Benjamin and Saul’s son Ish-bosheth and twelve to represent members of David’s staff.",
      "16": "Each man grabbed his opponent by the head, plunged his sword into his opponent’s side, and then they both fell together. That’s why the place at Gibeon was named The Field of Swords.",
      "17": "The battle was very violent that day, with Abner and the men of Israel being defeated in the presence of David’s servants.",
      "18": "Zeruiah’s three sons Joab, Abishai, and Asahel were there. As a runner, Asahel was fast, like one of the wild gazelles.",
      "19": "So Asahel ran straight after Abner, following him.",
      "20": "When Abner looked behind him, he said, “Is that you, Asahel?”\nHe answered, “I am.”",
      "21": "Abner told him, “Go off to your right or left after one of the young men and grab some war spoils.” But Asahel would not stop following him,",
      "22": "so Abner told Asahel again, “Stop following me. Why should I strike you down? How could I show my face to your brother Joab?”",
      "23": "But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner struck Asahel in the abdomen with the butt end of his spear, and the spear protruded through his back. He collapsed to the ground and died where he fell. Everyone gathered round the place where Asahel had collapsed and died, and stood still there.",
      "24": "Meanwhile, Joab and Abishai continued to chase Abner. At dusk, as they approached the hill of Ammah that is located near Giah on the way to the Gibeon desert,",
      "25": "the descendants of Benjamin rallied around Abner, forming a single military force. They took their stand on top of the hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called out to Joab, “Must the battle sword keep on devouring forever? Don’t you realize that the end result is bitterness? How long will it take for you to order your army to stop pursuing their own relatives?”",
      "27": "Joab answered, “As God lives, if you hadn’t spoken up, by morning my army would have broken off their pursuit of their own relatives.”",
      "28": "So Joab sounded his battle trumpet, his entire army stopped pursuing Israel any longer, and they quit fighting.",
      "29": "Abner and his army traveled through the Arabah by night, crossed the Jordan, and arrived at Mahanaim after marching all morning.",
      "30": "Joab returned from his pursuit of Abner, and when he had mustered his entire army, nineteen of David’s soldiers were missing besides Asahel.",
      "31": "Meanwhile, other soldiers of David had killed 360 of Abner’s men from the tribe of Benjamin.",

      "6": "While war continued between the dynasties of Saul and David, Abner was growing in influence within the dynasty of Saul.",
      "7": "Meanwhile, Saul had a mistress named Rizpah, who was the daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth asked Abner, “Why did you have sex with my father’s mistress?”",
      "8": "What Ish-bosheth said made Abner furious, so he replied, “A dog’s head for Judah—is that what I am? Up until today I’ve kept on showing loyalty to your father Saul’s dynasty, to his relatives and friends, and I haven’t turned you over to David, but you’re charging me today with moral guilt regarding this woman!",
      "9": "Therefore may God do to me—and more also!—just as the Lord has promised to David, since I’m doing this for him:",
      "10": "I will take away the kingdom from the dynasty of Saul by making the throne of David firm over Israel and Judah—from Dan to Beer-sheba!”",
      "11": "Ish-bosheth couldn’t say another word in response to Abner, because he was terrified of him.",
      "12": "So Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron to ask him, “Who owns this land? Cut a deal with me, and look!—I’ll lend my hand in bringing all of Israel over to you!”",
      "13": "David replied, “Sounds good to me! I’ll cut a deal with you under one condition: you’re not to show yourself in my presence unless you bring Saul’s daughter with you when you come to see me.”",
      "14": "Then David sent a delegation to Saul’s son Ish-bosheth to say, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was engaged with a dowry of 100 Philistine foreskins.”",
      "15": "So Ish-bosheth ordered that she be taken away from her husband, Laish’s son Paltiel.",
      "16": "Her husband accompanied her, crying as he followed after her all the way to Bahurim, where Abner told him, “Leave! Go back!” So he went back.",
      "17": "Later, Abner had a talk with the elders of Israel. He said, “In the past you were looking to see David made king over you.",
      "18": "So do it, then! Because the Lord has said this about David:\n‘Through my servant David I will save my people Israel\n    from the control of the Philistines\n        and from all of their enemies.’”",
      "19": "Abner also addressed the tribe of Benjamin. Furthermore, with David’s permission, Abner said anything that seemed like it would be good for Israel and for the entire tribe of Benjamin.",
      "20": "Afterwards, Abner brought 20 soldiers to David at Hebron, and David threw a party for Abner and the men who were with him.",
      "21": "So Abner told David, “Give me permission to go out and rally all of Israel to your majesty the king so they can enter into a formal agreement with you to reign over everything that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner off, and he went away in peace.",
      "22": "Right about then, David’s servants returned from a raid, bringing plenty of war booty with them, but Abner wasn’t in Hebron with David, since David had sent him away and Abner had left in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab returned with his entire army, Joab was informed, “Ner’s son Abner visited the king, and he has dismissed him. He has left in peace.”",
      "24": "So Joab approached the king and asked him, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you! What’s this? You sent him away? He’s long gone now!",
      "25": "You know Ner’s son Abner came to mislead you, to learn your troop movements, and to learn everything you’re doing!”",
      "26": "As soon as Joab left David, Joab sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah, but David was not aware of this.",
      "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab brought him aside within the gateway to talk to him alone and then stabbed him in the abdomen. So he died for shedding the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel.",
      "28": "Later on, David found out about it and proclaimed, “Let me and my kingdom remain guiltless forever in the Lord’s presence for the death of Ner’s son Abner.",
      "29": "May judgment rest on Joab’s head and on his father’s entire household. May Joab’s dynasty never be without one who has a discharge, who is a leper, who walks with a cane, who commits suicide, or who lacks food!”",
      "30": "He said this because Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner after he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.",
      "31": "David ordered Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” King David walked behind the funeral procession,",
      "32": "and they buried Abner at Hebron. The king wept loudly at Abner’s grave, and all the people wept, too.",
      "33": "The king composed this mourning song for Abner:\n“Should Abner’s death be like a fool’s?",
      "34": "Your hands were not bound,\n        nor were your feet in irons.\nAs one falls before the wicked,\n    you have fallen.”\nThen all the people cried again because of him.",
      "35": "Everyone tried to persuade David to have a meal while there was still daylight, but David took an oath by saying, “May God to do like this to me and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!”",
      "36": "Everybody took note of this and was very pleased, just as everything else the king did pleased everyone.",
      "37": "As a result, the entire army and all of Israel understood that day that the king had nothing to do with the murder of Ner’s son Abner.",
      "38": "The king reminded his staff, “Don’t you know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?",
      "39": "Today, even though I’m anointed as king, I’m weak. These men, sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the one who acts wickedly in accordance with his wickedness!”"

      "5": "Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, left and arrived during the hottest part of the day at the home of Ish-bosheth while he was taking a noon day nap.",
      "6": "They entered the house as though they intended to obtain some grain and stabbed him in the abdomen. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.",
      "7": "While they were in the house, they struck him, killed him, and cut off his head while he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They took his head, and traveled all night along the Arabah road.",
      "8": "They brought Ish-bosheth’s head to David at Hebron and told the king, “Look! Here’s the head of your enemy Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, who sought your life. Today the Lord has given your majesty the king vengeance on Saul and his descendants.”",
      "9": "David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite: “As the Lord lives, who has saved my life in every adversity,",
      "10": "when the man who told me ‘Look! Saul is dead!’ thought he was bringing me good news, I arrested him and had him killed at Ziklag as the reward I gave him for his news.",
      "11": "How much worse will it be, then, when evil men kill an innocent man on his own bed in his own house! Shouldn’t I avenge his blood—which you are responsible for shedding—by removing you from the earth?”",
      "12": "So David commanded his personal guards, and they killed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung up their bodies beside the pool at Hebron. They took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb at Hebron."

      "3": "So all the elders of Israel approached the king at Hebron, where King David entered into a covenant with them in the presence of the Lord. Then they anointed David to be king over Israel.",

      "6": "Later, the king and his army marched on Jerusalem against the Jebusites, who were inhabiting the territory at that time and who had told David, “You’re not coming in here! Even the blind and the lame could turn you away!” because they were thinking “David can’t come here.”",
      "7": "Even so, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now known as the City of David.",
      "8": "At that time, David had said, “Whoever intends to attack the Jebusites will have to climb up the water shaft to attack the lame and blind, who hate David.”\nTherefore they say, “The blind and lame are never to come into the house.”",
      "9": "David occupied the fortress, naming it the City of David. He built up the surroundings from the terrace ramparts inward.",
      "10": "David became more and more esteemed because the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies was with him.",
      "11": "Later, King Hiram of Tyre sent a delegation to David, accompanied by cedar logs, carpenters, and stone masons. They built a palace for David.",
      "12": "So David concluded that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom in order to benefit his people Israel.",
      "13": "But after arriving in Jerusalem after leaving Hebron, David took more wives and mistresses, and more sons and daughters were born to David.",

      "20": "So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated them there. He called the place Baal-perazim, because he said, “Like a bursting flood, the Lord has jumped out in front of me to fight my enemies.”",
      "21": "The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his army carried them off.",

      "37": "Absalom continued to flee, eventually going to Ammihud’s son King Talmai of Geshur, while King David continued to mourn for his son every day.",
      "38": "After fleeing to Geshur, Absalom remained there for three years.",
      "39": "Meanwhile, King David longed to visit Absalom, since he was moved to compassion over Amnon’s death."
    },
    "14": {
      "1": "Meanwhile, Zeruiah’s son Joab knew that the king’s attention was focused on Absalom,",
      "2": "so he sent messengers to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He told her, “Please play the role of a mourner, wear the clothes of a mourner, and refrain from using makeup. Act like a woman who’s been in mourning for the dead for many days.",
      "3": "Then go to the king and speak to him like this…” Then Joab told her what to say.",
      "4": "When the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, prostrating herself to address him, “Help, your majesty!”",
      "5": "The king asked her, “What’s your problem?”\n“I’ve been a widowed woman ever since my husband died,” she answered.",
      "6": "“Your humble servant used to have two sons, but they got into a fight out in the field. Because there was no one to keep them apart, one of them attacked the other and killed him.",
      "7": "Now please pay attention closely! My whole family is attacking your humble servant! They’re saying, ‘Turn over the one who attacked his brother and we’ll put him to death in retribution for his brother, whose life he took. That way, we’ll kill the heir also!’ They’re going to extinguish the only light left in my family, leaving my late husband neither an ongoing name nor a survivor on the face of the earth!”",
      "8": "Then the king replied to the woman, “Go home and I’ll issue a special order just for you.”",
      "9": "But the woman from Tekoa told the king, “Your majesty, let any guilt for this be on me and on my ancestors’ household, and not on my king or his throne!”",
      "10": "The king replied, “Bring anyone who talks to you about this to me, and he certainly won’t be bothering you anymore!”",
      "11": "Then she said, “Your majesty, please remember the Lord your God, so that blood avengers don’t do any more damage! Otherwise, they’ll destroy my son!”\nSo he promised, “As the Lord lives, not even a single hair from your son’s head will fall to the ground!”",
      "12": "At this, the woman responded, “Would your majesty the king please allow your humble servant to say one more thing?”\n“Say it…” he replied.",
      "13": "“Why, then,” the woman asked, “are you planning to act just like this against God’s people? Based on what your majesty has said, you’re acting like one who is guilty himself, because you’re not bringing back the one whom you’ve banished!",
      "14": "After all, even though we all die, and we’re all like water being spilled on the ground that cannot be recovered, nevertheless God doesn’t take away life, but carries out his plans so as not to cast away permanently from him those who are presently estranged.",
      "15": "“Now as to why I’ve come to speak with your majesty the king, it’s because the people have made me afraid, so your humble servant told herself, ‘I’ll go speak to the king, so perhaps the king will do what his humble servant has requested.",
      "16": "Perhaps the king will listen and deliver his humble servant from the oppression of the man who intends to eliminate both me and my son from what God has apportioned to us!’",
      "17": "“So your humble servant is saying, ‘Please, your majesty, let what the king has to say be of comfort, because just as the angel of God is, so also is your majesty the king to discern both good and evil. And may the Lord your God remain present with you.’”",
      "18": "In reply, the king asked the woman, “Please don’t conceal anything about which I’m going to be asking you now.”\nSo the woman replied, “Please, your majesty, let the king speak.”",
      "19": "Then the king asked, “Is Joab behind all of this with you?”\n“As your soul lives, your majesty, the king,” the woman answered, “no one can divert anything left or right from what your majesty the king has spoken! As a matter of fact, it was your servant Joab! He was there, giving me precise orders about everything that your humble servant was to say. Your servant Joab did this,",
      "20": "intending to change the outcome of this matter. Nevertheless, your majesty is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to be aware of everything that’s going on throughout the earth.”",
      "21": "Then the king addressed Joab, “Look! I’ll do this thing that you’ve requested. Go bring back the young man Absalom.”",
      "22": "At this, Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrating himself to bless the king, and then said, “Today your servant realizes that he’s found favor with you, your majesty, in that the king has acted on the request of his servant.”",
      "23": "Then Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "Nevertheless, the king said, “Let him return to his own home and not show his face to me.” So Absalom returned to his own home and did not show his face to the king.",
      "25": "Now throughout all of Israel no one was as handsome as Absalom or so highly praised, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there wasn’t a single thing wrong about him.",
      "26": "Whenever he cut his hair —he cut it at the end of every year, because it grew thick on his head, which is why he cut it—his hair weighed in at 200 shekels measured by the royal standard.",
      "27": "Absalom fathered three sons and one daughter, whom he named Tamar. She was a beautiful woman, both in form and appearance.",
      "28": "Meanwhile, Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but never saw the king’s face.",
      "29": "After this, Absalom sent for Joab, intending to send him to the king, but Joab would not come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but he still would not come.",
      "30": "So Absalom told his servants, “Observe that Joab’s grain field lies next to mine. He has barley planted there. Go set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.",
      "31": "At this, Joab got up, went to Absalom’s home, and demanded of him, “Why did your servants set fire to my grain field?”",
      "32": "In answer to Joab, Absalom replied, “Look, I sent for you, telling you ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask him “What’s the point in moving here from Geshur? I would have been better off to have remained there!”’ So let me see the king’s face, and if I’m guilty of anything, let him execute me!”",
      "33": "So when Joab approached the king and told him what Absalom had said, he summoned Absalom, who then came to the king and fell to the ground on his face in front of him. Then the king kissed Absalom."
    },
    "15": {
      "1": "Sometime later, Absalom acquired a chariot equipped with horses and recruited 50 men to accompany him.",
      "2": "Then he would get up early, stand near the passageway to the palace gate, and when anyone arrived to file a legal complaint for a hearing before the king, Absalom would call to him and ask, “You’re from what city?” If he replied, “Your servant is from one of Israel’s tribes,”",
      "3": "Absalom would respond, “Look, your claims are valid and defensible, but nobody will listen to you on behalf of the king.",
      "4": "Who will appoint me to be a judge in the land? When anyone arrived to file a legal complaint or other cause, he could approach me for justice and I would settle it!”",
      "5": "Furthermore, if a man approached him to bow down in front of him, he would put out his hand, grab him, and embrace him.",
      "6": "By doing all of this to anyone who came to the king for a hearing, Absalom stole the loyalty of the men of Israel.",
      "7": "And so it was that forty years after Israel had demanded a king, Absalom asked the king, “Please let me go to Hebron so I can pay my vow that I made to the Lord,",
      "8": "because when I was living at Geshur in Aram, your servant made this solemn promise: ‘If the Lord ever brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.’”",
      "9": "The king replied to him, “Go in peace!” So Absalom got up and left for Hebron.",
      "10": "But Absalom sent agents throughout all of the tribes of Israel, telling them, “When you hear the sound of the battle trumpet, you’re to announce that Absalom is king in Hebron.”",
      "11": "Meanwhile, 200 men left Jerusalem with Absalom. They had been invited to go along, but were innocent, not knowing anything about what was happening.",
      "12": "Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from his home town of Giloh while Absalom was presenting the sacrificial offerings. And so the conspiracy widened, because the common people increasingly sided with Absalom.",
      "13": "Then a messenger arrived to inform David, “The loyalties of the men of Israel have shifted to Absalom.”",
      "14": "So David told all of his staff who were with him in Jerusalem, “Let’s get up and get out of here! Otherwise, none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry, or he’ll overtake us quickly, bring disaster on all of us, and execute the inhabitants of the city!”",
      "15": "“Look!” the king’s staff replied. “Your servants will do whatever the king chooses.”",
      "16": "So the king left, taking his entire household with him except for ten mistresses, who were to keep the palace in order.",
      "17": "The king left, along with all of his people with him, and they paused at the last house.",
      "18": "All of his staff were going on ahead of him—that is, all of the special forces and mercenaries, all of the Gittites, and 600 men who had come to serve him from Gath, went on ahead of the king.",
      "19": "Then the king suggested to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you have to go with us? Return and stay with the new king, since you’re a foreigner and exile. Stay where you want to stay.",
      "20": "It seems only yesterday that you arrived, so should I make you wander around with us while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your brothers with you. May gracious love and truth accompany you!”",
      "21": "“As the Lord lives,” Ittai answered in reply, “and as your majesty the king lives, wherever your majesty my king may be—whether living or dying—that’s where your servant will be!”",
      "22": "So David replied, “Come along, then!” So Ittai the Gittite went along also, accompanied by all of his men and all of his little ones.",
      "23": "With all of the people in the territory crying loudly, everybody passed over the Kidron brook, along with the king. Then everyone headed out toward the road that leads to the wilderness.",
      "24": "Meanwhile, Zadok showed up also, along with all of the descendants of Levi with him, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God and Abiathar approached while all the people finished abandoning the city.",
      "25": "The king told Zadok, “Take the Ark of God back to the city. If I’m shown favor in the Lord’s sight, then he’ll bring me back again and show me both it and the place where it rests.",
      "26": "But if he should say something like ‘I’m not pleased with you,’ well then, here I am—let him do to me whatever seems right to him.”",
      "27": "The king also asked Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer, too? Go back to the city in comfort, along with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan.",
      "28": "Look! I’ll camp at the wilderness fords until you send word to inform me.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar returned the Ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.",
      "30": "David then left, going up the Mount of Olives, crying as he went, with his head covered and his feet bare. All of the people who were with him covered their own heads and climbed up the Mount of Olives, crying as they went along.",
      "31": "Just then, someone told David, “Ahithophel is one of Absalom’s conspirators!”\nSo David prayed, “Lord, please turn Ahithophel’s counsel into foolishness.”",
      "32": "Just as David was coming to the top of the Mount of Olives where God was being worshipped, there was Hushai the Archite to meet him, with his coat ripped and dust all over his head!",
      "33": "David greeted him, “If you come along with me, you’ll be a burden to me.",
      "34": "So go back to the city and tell Absalom, ‘I’ll be your servant, your majesty! Just as I served your father in the past, I can be your servant now.’ That way you can manipulate Ahithophel’s advice to my benefit.",
      "35": "Won’t Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? So whatever you hear from the king’s palace, you’re to report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",
      "36": "Their two sons—Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan—are with them there. You’ll be sending me everything that you hear through them.”",
      "37": "So David’s friend Hushai went back to the city just as Absalom was arriving in Jerusalem."
    },
    "16": {
      "1": "Now just as David happened to have passed the summit of the Mount of Olives, suddenly Mephibosheth’s servant Ziba met him, accompanied by a couple of saddled donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 pieces of summer fruit, and a skin of wine!",
      "2": "The king asked Ziba, “What are those for?”\nZiba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for whoever wants to drink if they get weary in the wilderness.”",
      "3": "Then the king asked, “Where is your master’s son?”\n“He’s staying in Jerusalem!” Ziba answered the king. “He’s saying ‘The nation of Israel will restore my father’s kingdom to me today!’”",
      "4": "So the king told Ziba, “Pay attention! Everything that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!”\nIn response Ziba said, “I’m submitting to you. Let me find favor in your sight, your majesty the king!”",
      "5": "Later on, as King David approached Bahurim, Gera’s son Shimei, who was related to the family of Saul’s household, went out to meet David, cursing continually as he approached.",
      "6": "He threw rocks at David and all of David’s staff who were accompanying him, while all the rest of the entourage, including all of David’s security detail, were close by him.",
      "7": "“Get out of here! Get out!” Shimei yelled as he cursed. “You murderer! You who think you’re above the law!",
      "8": "The Lord has repaid you personally for murdering the entire dynasty of Saul, whose place you’ve taken to reign! And the Lord has given the kingdom into your son Absalom’s control. Now look! Your own evil has caught up with you, because you’re guilty of murder!”",
      "9": "At this point, Zeruiah’s son Abishai asked the king, “Why should this dead dog be cursing your majesty the king? May I have permission to go over and cut off his head?”",
      "10": "But the king responded, “What do I have in common with you sons of Zeruiah? If he continues to curse—and if the Lord has told him, ‘Curse David!’—then who are you to be demanding to know ‘Why have you done this?’”",
      "11": "So David ordered Abishai and all of his staff: “Look! My own son wants to kill me! How much more now is this descendant of Benjamin? Leave him alone and let him go on cursing, because the Lord has ordered him to do this.",
      "12": "Perhaps the Lord will take note of my troubles and return good to me instead of curses today!”",
      "13": "So David and his entourage went on their way, and Shimei walked along the hillside with him, cursing, throwing rocks, and tossing dirt at David as they went along.",
      "14": "Eventually, the king and his entourage arrived exhausted at their destination, and David refreshed himself there.",
      "15": "Right about then, Absalom and his entourage from the people of Israel entered Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.",
      "16": "When David’s friend Hushai the Archite approached Absalom, Hushai greeted Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”",
      "17": "But Absalom asked Hushai, “So this is how you demonstrate your loyalty to your closest friends? Why didn’t you leave with your friend?”",
      "18": "Hushai replied, “No! On the contrary, whomever the Lord, this group, and all the men of Israel choose is where I’ll be, and I’ll remain with him!",
      "19": "Besides, who else should I be serving? Why not the son? The same way I served your father, I’ll serve you.”",
      "20": "So Absalom asked Ahithophel, “What’s your advice? What should we do?”",
      "21": "Ahithophel responded, “Go inside and have sex with your father’s mistresses, whom he left to keep the palace in order. Then everyone in Israel will hear how your father has come to hate you and everyone who has joined you will be emboldened to act.”",
      "22": "So they erected a tent for Absalom on the palace roof and Absalom went in and had sex with his father’s mistresses right in front of all Israel.",
      "23": "Now Ahithophel’s advice that he provided at that time was being compared to one who inquired of God, so highly regarded was Ahithophel’s counsel by both David and Absalom."
    },
    "17": {
      "1": "“Give me 12,000 men! I’ll leave tonight and pursue David,” Ahithophel advised Absalom.",
      "2": "“I’ll catch him while he is still tired and weak. I’ll frighten him so all his people with him desert him. But I’ll only kill the king.",
      "3": "Then I’ll bring everybody else back to you. When the man you’re looking for is dead, all the rest of the people will return quietly.”",
      "4": "Even though this plan seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all of the elders of Israel,",
      "5": "Absalom replied, “Call in Hushai the Archite so I can hear what he has to say, too!”",
      "6": "When Hushai approached Absalom, Absalom asked him, “Here’s what Ahithophel had to advise. Should we do what he says? Or if not, say so!”",
      "7": "“Ahithophel’s advice is not best at this time,” Hushai suggested to Absalom.",
      "8": "“You know how strong your father and his men are. They’re as mad as a bear robbed of her cubs! Furthermore, your father is a skilled warrior. He won’t stay with his army at night.",
      "9": "Look! He’s probably already hiding in a cave or someplace like that. If the first attack fails, people will hear about it and think, ‘Absalom’s army is losing!’",
      "10": "Then even men who would otherwise be as brave as lions will be scared, because every Israeli knows your father is a mighty man, and they know his men are valiant!",
      "11": "So here’s my advice: Muster everybody from one end of the country to the other! You’ll have an army in number like the sand on the seashore! Then you’ll go into battle!",
      "12": "We’ll go find David wherever he’s hiding. We’ll fall on him like dew on the ground! We’ll kill him and all of his men, and we won’t leave even one man alive!",
      "13": "If he escapes into a city, we’ll bring ropes to that city and tear it down! We won’t leave a single stone left in the valley!”",
      "14": "Absalom and all of the Israelis replied, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel’s!”\nBut the Lord had planned to circumvent the sound advice of Ahithophel so the Lord could bring Absalom to destruction.",
      "15": "So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the elders of Israel. He also reported what he himself had proposed. Hushai said,",
      "16": "“Quick! Get word to David! Tell him not to spend the night at the crossings that lead to the desert. Instead, he must cross the Jordan River immediately. That way, if he crosses the river, the king and his entourage will survive.”",
      "17": "Meanwhile, since they could not risk being seen entering the city, Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at En-rogel, where a young servant woman was to go to inform them and they would then go brief King David.",
      "18": "But a young man observed Jonathan and Ahimaaz and informed Absalom, so they left in a hurry, arrived at the home of a man who lived at Bahurim, and hid inside a well that was in his courtyard.",
      "19": "The man’s wife grabbed a sheet, covered the mouth of the well with it, and spread some dried grain over it. As a result, nobody could tell it was a hiding place.",
      "20": "When Absalom’s servants approached the woman of the house, they asked her, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”\n“They’ve already crossed the brook,” the woman answered. So Absalom’s servants went away in search of Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they couldn’t find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.",
      "21": "A little while later, the men crawled up out of the well and went off to talk to King David. They told David, “Get up! Cross the water quickly, because this is what Ahithophel advised about you…”",
      "22": "So David got up and all of his entourage crossed the Jordan River. Everyone had crossed the Jordan River by dawn’s first light.",
      "23": "Meanwhile, when Ahithophel observed that his counsel was not being acted upon, he saddled his donkey, got up, and left for his hometown. Leaving behind a set of orders for his household, he hanged himself. After his death he was buried in his father’s tomb.",
      "24": "Later, David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom and all of the Israelis who supported him crossed the Jordan River.",
      "25": "Absalom had installed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. (Amasa was the son of a man named Jether the Ishmaelite. His mother was Abigail, a daughter of Nahash and a sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.)",
      "26": "Absalom and the Israelis with him camped in the territory of Gilead.",
      "27": "When David arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi (Nahash’s son from the Ammonite town of Rabbah), Makir (Ammiel’s son from Lo-debar), and Barzillai (from Rogelim in Gilead) were already there.",
      "28": "They brought along bedding, bowls, clay basins, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grains, beans, peas,",
      "29": "honey, cheeses, sheep, and cheese made from cow’s milk for David and his entourage because they had been reasoning, “The people are hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the wilderness.”"

    "18": {
      "1": "David mustered his forces and appointed officers in charge of regiments and companies.",
      "2": "Dividing his forces into three groups, he set Joab as commander of one third of his army, Zeruiah’s son Abishai, Joab’s brother, as commander of another third, and Ittai from Gath as commander of another third. The king informed the army, “I’m going out to battle with you, too.”",
      "3": "“No way!” his army responded. “If we have to retreat from the battle, Absalom’s men won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care about us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. The best thing you can do for us is to remain in the city.”",
      "4": "So David responded, “I’ll do what you think best.” Then he stood alongside the city gate as the army went out in battle array by hundreds and thousands.",
      "5": "As they were going out, the king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat young Absalom gently for my sake.” Everyone heard what the king had ordered his commanders about Absalom.",
      "6": "David’s army left for the battlefield to fight Absalom and his Israeli followers, and they also fought in the Ephraim forest,",
      "7": "where David’s army of servants defeated the Israelis. Many died that day—20,000 men.",
      "8": "The battle spread throughout the entire countryside, and the forest claimed more casualties that day than did the sword fighting.",
      "9": "Absalom happened to run into David’s soldiers. While Absalom was trying to get away on his mule, it ran under the thick branches of a giant oak tree, and Absalom’s head got caught in the tree! As his mule ran out from under him, Absalom was left hanging above the ground.",
      "10": "When one of the soldiers saw what had happened, he told Joab, “I saw Absalom stuck in an oak tree!”",
      "11": "Joab asked the man who was reporting to him, “What! You saw him? Why didn’t you kill him right then and there? I would’ve given you ten pieces of silver and a warrior’s sash!”",
      "12": "But the soldier replied to Joab, “I wouldn’t have touched the king’s son even if you dropped 1,000 pieces of silver right into my hands, because we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, ‘Watch how you treat the young man Absalom!’",
      "13": "If I had taken his life, the king would have uncovered everything about it, and you would never have protected me!”",
      "14": "“There’s no reason to wait for you!” Joab retorted. Then he took three spears in his hand and stabbed Absalom in the heart while he was still alive, dangling from the branches of the oak tree.",
      "15": "Ten young men who served as Joab’s personal assistants then surrounded Absalom, striking him repeatedly and killing him.",
      "16": "At this, Joab sounded his battle trumpet and his troops stopped pursuing the other Israelis.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Joab’s army grabbed Absalom’s body, tossed it into a large pit in the forest, and filled it up with a huge pile of rocks. Then the Israelis ran away back to their homes.",
      "18": "While Absalom had been living, he had erected a pillar as a monument to himself in King’s Valley because he had been telling himself, “I don’t have a son to carry on my family name.” So he named the pillar after himself—it’s called Absalom’s Monument even today.",
      "19": "Zadok’s son Ahimaaz told Joab, “Let me run over to King David and take him the news. I’ll mention that the Lord has delivered him from his enemies.”",
      "20": "But Joab answered Ahimaaz, “You’re not the man to deliver news today. Do it any other time, but not today, because the king’s son is dead.”",
      "21": "So Joab ordered a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you’ve seen.” So the Ethiopian saluted Joab and then ran to tell David.",
      "22": "“Please,” Zadok’s son Ahimaaz continued, “No matter what happens, let me follow the Ethiopian!”\nJoab asked him, “Why this request to run, my son? There’s no reward in it for you.”",
      "23": "“No matter what, I’m running,” Ahimaaz replied.\nSo Joab told Ahimaaz, “Run!” And Ahimaaz ran, taking the Jordan Valley road, passing the Ethiopian.",
      "24": "Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city. The watchman was up on the roof of the gateway near the walls, looking around, and there was a man running by himself!",
      "25": "So the watchman called out his news to the king.\nThe king responded, “If he’s alone, he’s bringing some news to report.” As the man continued to draw near and approach the palace,",
      "26": "the watchman observed another man running. So he called out to the gatekeeper, “There’s another man running by himself!”\nThe king replied, “He’s also bringing some news to report!”",

      "35": "I’m now 80 years old! I can hardly tell the difference between what tastes good or bad! I can’t tell what I eat or drink! I can’t hear the voice of men and women when they sing! So why should your servant be an added burden to your majesty the king?",
      "36": "Your servant will cross the Jordan River with the king for a short distance, but why should the king offer me this reward?",

      "1": "Later, God’s anger blazed forth against Israel, so he incited David to move against them by telling him, “Go take a census of Israel and Judah.”",
      "2": "So the king ordered Joab, commander of the special forces, who was with him, “Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba and take a census of the people so I can be made aware of the total number.”",

      "14": "So David replied to Gad, “This is a very difficult choice for me to make! Let me now please fall into the hand of the Lord, since his mercy is very great, but may I never fall into human hands!”",

      "16": "As the angel was stretching out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord was grieved because of the calamity, so he told the angel who was afflicting the people, “Enough! Stay your hand!” So the angel of the Lord remained near the threshing floor that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite.",
      "17": "When David saw the angel who had been attacking the people, he told the Lord, “Look, I’m the one who has sinned! I did the evil. These are only sheep! What did they do? Please, let your hand fall on me and on my household!”",

      "24": "“No!” the king replied to Araunah. “I will buy them from you at full price. I won’t offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 silver shekels,",
