  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "Sometime after Joshua had died, the Israelis asked the Lord, “Who is to lead us against the Canaanites in our opening attack against them?”",
      "2": "The Lord replied, “The tribe of Judah is to lead you. Look! I’ve given the land into their control.”",
      "3": "But the tribe of Judah told the tribe of Simeon, the descendants of Judah’s brother, “Come with us into our territory, and we’ll both fight the Canaanites. In return, we’ll go with you when you fight in your territory.” So the army of the tribe of Simeon accompanied the army of the tribe of Judah.",
      "4": "When the army of the tribe of Judah went into battle, the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their control, and they defeated 10,000 men at Bezek.",
      "5": "They located Adoni-bezek in Bezek, fought him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.",
      "6": "Adoni-bezek ran off, but they pursued him, caught him, and amputated his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni-bezek used to brag, “Seventy kings without thumbs and big toes used to eat what was left under my table. God has repaid me for what I’ve done.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he later died there.",
      "8": "Then the army of Judah attacked Jerusalem, captured it, executed its inhabitants, and set fire to the city.",
      "9": "Later, the army of Judah left Jerusalem to attack the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, the Negev, and the Shephelah.",
      "10": "They attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba) and fought Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "The army of Judah then proceeded to attack the inhabitants of Debir, which used to be known as Kiriath-sepher.",
      "12": "Caleb announced, “I’ll give my daughter Achsah in marriage to whomever leads the attack against Kiriath-sepher and captures it.”",
      "13": "Othniel, Caleb’s nephew through his younger brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb awarded him his daughter Achsah in marriage.",
      "14": "Later on, after she had arrived, she urged Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want for yourself?”",
      "15": "“I want this blessing from you,” she replied. “Since you’ve given me land in the Negev, give me water springs, too.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.",
      "16": "The descendants of the Kenites, the tribe from which Moses’ father-in-law came, accompanied the descendants of Judah from the city of the palms to the Judean wilderness, which is in the desert area south of Arad, and lived with the people there.",
      "17": "The army of Judah accompanied the army of Simeon, Judah’s brother, as they attacked the Canaanites who were living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed it. Then they renamed the city Hormah.",
      "18": "The army of Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory.",
      "19": "The Lord was with the army of Judah, and they captured the hill country, but did not expel the inhabitants of the valley because they were equipped with iron chariots.",
      "20": "They gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.",
      "21": "However, the descendants of Benjamin did not expel the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the descendants of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.",
      "22": "Then the army of the tribe of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "The army of the tribe of Joseph scouted out Bethel, which had been formerly named Luz.",
      "24": "The scouts observed a man coming out of the city and they promised him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we’ll deal kindly with you.”",
      "25": "So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they attacked the city with swords, but they let the man and his entire family escape.",
      "26": "So the man traveled to the land of the Hittites and built a city that he named “Luz,” and it is called by that name to this day.",
      "27": "The army of the tribe of Manasseh did not conquer Beth-shean and its villages, Taanach and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live in that land.",
      "28": "When Israel had grown strong, they subjected the Canaanites to conscripted labor and never did expel them completely.",
      "29": "The army of the tribe of Ephraim did not expel the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.",
      "30": "The army of the tribe of Zebulun did not expel the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but were subjected to conscripted labor.",
      "31": "The army of the tribe of Asher did not expel the inhabitants of Acco nor the inhabitants of Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.",
      "32": "So the descendants of Asher lived among the Canaanites who continued to inhabit the land, because they did not expel them.",
      "33": "The army of the tribe of Naphtali did not expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and the inhabitants of Beth-anath. Instead, they lived among the Canaanites who inhabited the land. However, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were subjected to conscripted labor.",
      "34": "Later on, the Amorites forced the descendants of Dan into the hill country and did not permit them to come into the valleys of the hills.",
      "35": "Furthermore, the Amorites continued to inhabit Mount Heres in Aijalon and Shaalbim. Eventually, however, after the tribe of Joseph had become strong, the Amorites were subjected to conscripted labor.",
      "36": "The Amorite border extended upward from the Akrabbim Ascent, that is, from Sela."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Some time later, the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and announced to Israel, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land that I promised to your ancestors. I had told them, ‘I’ll never breach my covenant with you.",
      "2": "As for you, you must not make any treaties with the inhabitants of this land. Instead, tear down their altars.’ But you haven’t obeyed me. What have you done?",
      "3": "Therefore I’m now saying, ‘I won’t expel them before you. Instead, they’ll remain at your side, and their gods will ensnare you.’”",
      "4": "Because the angel of the Lord said these things to all of the Israelis, the people wept out loud,",
      "5": "which is why they named the place Bochim. And there they sacrificed to the Lord.",
      "6": "After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelis returned to their respective inheritances to take possession of the land.",
      "7": "The people served the Lord during the entire lifetime of Joshua as well as the lifetimes of all the elders who outlived Joshua and who had observed all the great deeds that the Lord had done for Israel.",
      "8": "But then Nun’s son Joshua, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years.",
      "9": "They buried him in Timnath-heres, within the boundaries of his inheritance in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "After that whole generation had died, another generation grew up after them that was not acquainted with the Lord or with what he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "So the Israelis practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by worshiping Canaanite deities.",
      "12": "They abandoned the Lord God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who surrounded them. They bowed down in worship of them, and by doing so angered the Lord.",
      "13": "As a result, they abandoned the Lord by serving both Baal and Ashtaroth.",
      "14": "So in his burning anger against Israel, the Lord gave them into the domination of marauders who plundered them. The enemies who surrounded the Israelis controlled them, and they were no longer able to withstand their adversaries.",
      "15": "Wherever they went, the Lord worked against them to bring misfortune, just as the Lord had warned, and just as the Lord had promised them. As a result, they suffered greatly.",
      "16": "Then the Lord raised up leaders, who delivered Israel from domination by their marauders.",
      "17": "But they didn’t listen to their leaders, because they were committing spiritual immorality by following other gods and worshiping them. They quickly turned away from the road on which their ancestors had walked in obedience to the commands of the Lord. They didn’t follow their example.",
      "18": "As a result, whenever the Lord raised up leaders for them, the Lord remained present with their leader, delivering Israel from the control of their enemies during the lifetime of that leader. The Lord was moved with compassion by their groaning that had been caused by those who were oppressing and persecuting them.",
      "19": "However, after the leader had died, they would relapse to a condition more corrupt than their ancestors, following other gods, serving them, and worshiping them. They would not abandon their activities or their obstinate lifestyles.",
      "20": "In his burning anger against Israel, the Lord said, “Because the people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors to keep, and because they haven’t obeyed me,",
      "21": "I’m also going to stop expelling any of the nations that remained after Joshua died.",
      "22": "That way, I’ll use them to demonstrate whether or not Israel will keep the Lord’s lifestyle by walking on that road like their ancestors did.”",
      "23": "So the Lord caused those nations to remain and did not expel them quickly. He did not give them into Joshua’s control."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Here’s a list of nations that the Lord caused to remain in order to test Israel (that is, everyone who had not gained any battle experience in Canaan)",
      "2": "only so that successive Israeli generations, who had not known war previously, might come to know it by experience.",
      "3": "These nations included the five lords of the Philistines, all of the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.",
      "4": "They remained there to test Israel, to reveal if they would obey the commands of the Lord that he issued to their ancestors through Moses.",
      "5": "The Israelis continued to live among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,",
      "6": "taking their daughters as wives for themselves, giving their own daughters to their sons, and serving their gods.",
      "7": "The Israelis kept on practicing evil in full view of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served Canaanite male and female deities.",
      "8": "Then in his burning anger against Israel, the Lord delivered them to domination by King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim. So the Israelis served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years.",
      "9": "When the Israelis cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, to deliver them, and he did.",
      "10": "The Spirit of the Lord was on him, and he governed Israel. When Othniel went out to battle, the Lord handed king Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim into his control, and Othniel’s domination of Cushan-rishathaim was strong.",
      "11": "As a result, the land was quiet for 40 years. Then Kenaz’ son Othniel died.",
      "12": "The Israelis again practiced evil in full view of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab in his control over Israel, because they had practiced evil in full view of the Lord.",
      "13": "Eglon assembled together the Ammonites and the Amalekites, proceeded to attack Israel, and captured the cities of palms.",
      "14": "So the Israelis served king Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the Israelis cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up Gera’s son Ehud, a left-handed descendant of Benjamin, as a deliverer for them. The Israelis paid tribute through him to king Eglon of Moab.",
      "16": "Ehud forged a double-edged sword that was one cubit long, tied it to his right thigh under his cloak,",
      "17": "and went to present the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon happened to be a very obese man.",
      "18": "As he finished presenting the tribute, Ehud sent away the people who had been carrying it.",
      "19": "He had turned away from the idols that were at Gilgal. So he told Eglon, “I have a secret message for you, king.”\nKing Eglon responded “Silence!” and all of his attendants left him.",
      "20": "Ehud approached him while he was sitting by himself in the cool roof chamber of his palace. He said, “I have a message from God for you!” So when Eglon got up from his seat,",
      "21": "Ehud used his left hand to take the sword from his right thigh and then plunged it into Eglon’s abdomen.",
      "22": "The hilt also penetrated along with the sword blade, and Eglon’s fat closed in over the blade. Because he did not withdraw the sword from Eglon’s abdomen, the sword point exited from Eglon’s entrails.",
      "23": "Then Ehud left the cool chamber in the direction of the vestibule, shutting and locking the doors behind him.",
      "24": "After he left, Eglon’s attendants came to look, but the doors to the cool chamber were locked! So they said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner part of the cool chamber.”",
      "25": "They waited until they were embarrassed, since he never opened the doors to the chamber. Eventually they took a key, opened the doors, and found their master dead on the ground.",
      "26": "Meanwhile, Ehud escaped while they were delayed, passed by the idols, and escaped in the direction of Seirah.",
      "27": "When he arrived there, he sounded a trumpet in the mountainous region of Ephraim. While the Israeli army accompanied Ehud from the mountainous regions,",
      "28": "he told them, “Attack them, because the Lord has given your enemies—the Moabites—into your control.” So the Israeli army followed after him, seized the fords of the Jordan River opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross.",
      "29": "At that time they attacked about 10,000 Moabites, all of whom were strong and valiant men. Not one man escaped.",
      "30": "As a result, Moab was subdued under the control of Israel, and the land remained quiet for 80 years.",
      "31": "After Ehud, Anath’s son Shamgar attacked 600 Philistines with a cattle prod. He also delivered Israel."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "After Ehud died, while the Lord was watching, the Israelis made the evil they had been practicing even worse,",
      "2": "so the Lord turned them over to domination by King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commanding officer of his army, lived in Harosheth-haggoyim.",
      "3": "The Israelis cried out to the Lord, because of his 900 iron chariots. Jabin oppressed the Israelis forcefully for twenty years.",
      "4": "Deborah, a woman, prophet, and wife of Lappidoth, was herself judging Israel during that time.",
      "5": "She regularly took her seat under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountainous region of Ephraim, where the Israelis would approach her for decisions.",
      "6": "She sent word to Abinoam’s son Barak from Kedesh-naphtali, summoning him. She asked him, “The Lord God of Israel has commanded you, hasn’t he? He told you, ‘Go out, march to Mount Tabor, and take 10,000 men with you from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.",
      "7": "I will draw out Sisera, the commanding officer of Jabin’s army, along with his chariots and troops, to the Kishon River, where I will drop him right into your hands.’”",
      "8": "“If you’ll go with me, I’ll go,” Barak replied. “But if you won’t go with me, then I’m not going.”",
      "9": "She responded, “I will surely go with you, but the road that you’re about to take will not lead to honor for you. The Lord will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman.” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak toward Kedesh.",
      "10": "Barak called out the army of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to march on Kedesh, and 10,000 men went out to war with him, along with Deborah.",
      "11": "Meanwhile, Heber the Kenite had been separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law Hobab. He had pitched his tents far away, near the Elon-bezaanannim.",
      "12": "Furthermore, Sisera had been informed that Abinoam’s son Barak had marched on Mount Tabor.",
      "13": "So Sisera gathered his iron chariots together from Harosheth-haggoyim—all 900 of them, along with all the people who were assigned to them—and they assembled at the Kishon River.",
      "14": "“Get going!” Deborah told Barak. “Because today’s the day when the Lord has dropped Sisera into your hands! Look! The Lord has already gone out ahead of you!” So Barak left Mount Tabor, followed by 10,000 men,",
      "15": "and the Lord threw Sisera, all the chariots, and his entire army into a panic right in front of Barak. Then Sisera abandoned his chariot and escaped on foot",
      "16": "while Barak chased the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-haggoyim. Sisera’s entire army died in the battle—not even one soldier remained.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Sisera had escaped on foot to a tent belonging to Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, since there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the household of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "Jael went out to greet Sisera. “Turn aside, sir!” she told him. “Turn aside to me! Don’t be afraid.” So he turned aside to her and entered her tent, where she concealed him behind a curtain.",
      "19": "He asked her, “Please give me some water to drink, because I’m thirsty.” Instead, she opened a leather container of milk, gave him a drink, and then covered him up.",
      "20": "He told her, “Stand in the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks ‘Is anybody here?’ say ‘No’.”",
      "21": "But Heber’s wife Jael grabbed a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other, crept up to him quietly, and drove the tent peg right through his temple into the ground below after he had fallen sound asleep from exhaustion. That’s how he died.",
      "22": "Meanwhile, as Barak continued chasing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. “Come with me,” she told him, “and I’ll show you the man you’re looking for!” So he went with her, and there was Sisera, lying dead with the tent peg still embedded in his temple!",
      "23": "That’s how God subdued Jabin, king of Canaan right in front of the Israelis that day.",
      "24": "And the Israelis gained greater control over King Jabin of Canaan until they had eliminated him."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Later that day, Deborah and Abinoam’s son Barak celebrated by singing this song:",
      "2": "“When hair grows long in Israel,\n    when the people give themselves willingly,\n        bless the Lord!",
      "3": "Listen, you kings!\n    Turn your ears to me, you rulers!\nAs for me, to the Lord I will sing!\n    I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel.",
      "4": "Lord, when you left Seir,\n    when you marched out\n        from the grain field of Edom,\nthe earth quaked\n    and the heavens poured out rain;\n        indeed, the clouds poured out water.",
      "5": "Mountains tremble at the presence of the Lord —\n    even Sinai!—at the presence of the Lord God of Israel.",
      "6": "During the lifetime of Anath’s son Shamgar\n    and during the lifetime of Jael\nhighways remained deserted,\n    while travelers kept to back roads.",
      "7": "Rural populations plummeted in Israel;\n    until I, Deborah, arose;\n        until I—an Israeli mother—arose.",
      "8": "New gods were chosen,\n    then war came to the city gates,\nbut there wasn’t a shield or spear to be seen\n    among 40,000 soldiers of Israel.",
      "9": "My heart is for the commanders of Israel,\n    to those who work willingly among the people.\n        Bless the Lord!",
      "10": "“Speak up, you who ride white donkeys,\n    sitting on cloth saddles\n        while you travel on your way!",
      "11": "From the sound of those who divide their work loads\n    at the watering troughs,\nthere they will retell the righteous deeds of the Lord,\n    the righteous victories for his rural people in Israel.”\nThen the people of the Lord went down to the gates.",
      "12": "“Wake up! Wake up, Deborah!\n    Wake up! Wake up, Deborah!\nGet up, Barak, and dispose of your captives,\n    you son of Abinoam!",
      "13": "Then the survivors approached the nobles;\n    the people of the Lord approached me in battle array.",
      "14": "Some came from Ephraim\n    who had been harassed by Amalek,\n        followed by Benjamin with your people.\nSome commanders came from Machir,\n    along with some from Zebulun\n        who carry a badge of office.",
      "15": "The officials of Issachar were with Deborah,\n    as was the tribe of Issachar and Barak.\nThey rushed out into the valley at his heels\n    along with divisions from Reuben’s army.\n        Great was their resolve of heart!",
      "16": "Why did you sit down among the sheepfolds?\n    To hear the bleating of the flocks?\nAmong the divisions of the army of Reuben\n    there was great searching of heart.",
      "17": "The tribe of Gilead remained\n    on the other side of the Jordan River.\nAs for the tribe of Dan,\n    why did they stay on board their ships?\nThe tribe of Asher sat by the seashore\n    and remained near its harbors.",
      "18": "The tribe of Zebulun did not worry about their lives\n    at the price of death;\nneither did the tribe of Naphtali also\n    on high places of the field.",
      "19": "“Kings came to fight,\n    then battled the kings of Canaan\n        at Taanach near the waters of Megiddo.\nThey took no silver\n    as the spoils of war.",
      "20": "The stars fought from heaven;\n    they fought against Sisera from their orbits.",
      "21": "The current of the Kishon River swept them downstream,\n    that ancient current, the Kishon’s current!\n        March on strongly, my soul!",
      "22": "Then loud was the beat of the horses’ hooves—\n    from the galloping, galloping war steeds!",
      "23": "“‘Meroz is cursed!’ declared the angel of the Lord.\n    ‘Utterly and totally cursed are its inhabitants,\nbecause they never came to the aid of the Lord,\n    to the aid of the Lord against the valiant warriors!’”",
      "24": "“Blessed above all women is Jael,\n    wife of Heber the Kenite;\n        most blessed is she among women who live in tents!",
      "25": "Sisera asked for water—\n    she gave him milk.\n        In a magnificent bowl she brought him yogurt!",
      "26": "She reached out one hand for the tent peg,\n    and her other for the workman’s mallet.\nThen she struck Sisera,\n    smashing his head,\n        shattering and piercing his temple.",
      "27": "He crumpled to the ground between her feet,\n    where he fell down and collapsed.\nBetween her feet he crumpled,\n    Fallen dead!",
      "28": "“Back at home, out the window Sisera’s mother peered,\n    lamenting through the lattice.\n‘Why is his chariot delayed in returning?\n    ‘Why do the hoof beats of his chariots wait?’",
      "29": "Her wise attendants find an answer for her;\n    in fact, she tells the same words to herself:",
      "30": "‘They’re busy finding and dividing the war booty, aren’t they?\n    A girl or two for each valiant warrior,\nand some dyed materials for Sisera—\n    perhaps dyed, embroidered war booty—\nor some detailed embroidery for my neck\n    as the booty of war!",
      "31": "“May all of your enemies perish like this, Lord!\n    But may those who love him be\n        like the ascending sun in its strength!”\nThen the land enjoyed quiet for 40 years."

      "1": "Later on, the Israelis practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, so the Lord handed them over to the domination of Midian for seven years.",
      "2": "Midian’s control predominated throughout Israel, and because of Midian the Israelis went out to find temporary hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and fortified places.",
      "3": "Whenever the Israelis sowed their crops, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and certain groups from the east would come up and invade them.",
      "4": "They set up their military encampments to fight them, destroyed the harvest of the land as far as Gaza, and left nothing in Israel, whether harvested grain, sheep, oxen, or donkeys.",
      "5": "They would invade with their livestock and tents, swooping in as numerous as locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels—and they came into the land to destroy it.",
      "6": "Because Israel was deeply impoverished due to the Midianites, they cried out to the Lord.",
      "7": "When the Israelis cried out to him about Midian,",
      "8": "the Lord sent a man who was a prophet to the Israelis and told them, “This is what the Lord God of Israel says: ‘I was the one who brought you up from the land of Egypt, delivering you from the house of servitude.",
      "9": "I delivered you from the domination of Egypt and from the domination of all of your oppressors, expelling them right in front of you and giving their land to you.",
      "10": "I told you, “I am the Lord your God. You are not to fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you’ll be living.”’ But you haven’t obeyed what I said.”",
      "11": "After this, the angel of the Lord arrived and sat down in the shade of the oak tree in Ophrah that belonged to Joash, a descendant of Abiezer, while his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a wine press in order to safeguard it from the Midianites.",
      "12": "The angel of the Lord appeared to him and told him, “The Lord is with you, you valiant warrior!”",
      "13": "But Gideon replied, “Right… Sir, if the Lord is with us, then why has all of this happened to us? And where are all of his miraculous works that our ancestors recounted to us when they said, ‘The Lord brought us up from Egypt, didn’t he?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us over to Midian!”",
      "14": "The Lord looked straight at him and replied, “Go with this determination of yours and deliver Israel from Midian’s domination. I’ve directed you, haven’t I?”",
      "15": "“Right…,” Gideon responded. “Sir, how will I deliver Israel? Look—my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I’m the youngest in my father’s household.”",
      "16": "The Lord told him, “Because I’ll be with you, and you’ll defeat Midian—every single one of them!”",
      "17": "So Gideon asked him, “Please, if I have received favor from you, then do a miracle for me that shows that you’re making this promise to me.",
      "18": "And please don’t leave here until I’ve come back to you, brought my offering, and set it down in front of you.”\nThe Lord replied, “I’ll stay until you return.”",
      "19": "Then Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and poured the broth into a pot, and brought them to the angel right under the oak tree. Then he made his offering.",
      "20": "The angel, who was God, replied, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this boulder. Then pour out the broth.” So he did that.",
      "21": "The angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and unleavened bread. Fire broke out from inside the boulder, consuming the meat and unleavened bread. Then the angel of the Lord vanished in front of him.",

      "26": "and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this stronghold in an orderly manner. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering using the wood from the Asherah that you’ll be cutting down.”",
      "27": "So Gideon went with ten men who were his servants and did just what the Lord had told him to do, though he did it at night because he was too afraid of his father’s family and the leading men of the city to do it during the day.",
      "28": "When the leading men of the city got up early the next morning, the altar to Baal had been torn down, along with the Asherah that had stood beside it, and the second bull had been offered on the altar that had been erected.",
      "29": "They asked each other, “Who did this thing?” When they looked into it and asked around, they concluded, “Joash’s son Gideon did it.”",
      "30": "So the leading men of the city ordered Joash, “Bring us that son of yours. He’s going to die, because he tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah that stood beside it!”",
      "31": "But Joash responded to everyone who was opposing him, “Do you really intend to fight on Baal’s behalf? Do you really intend to rescue him by ordering that whoever fights him will be executed by morning? If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself. After all, it was his altar that was torn down.”",
      "32": "So that very day he named Gideon Jerubbaal, that is, “Let Baal fight,” since he had torn down his altar.",
      "33": "Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and certain groups from the east gathered together, crossed the Jordan River, and set up camp in the Jezreel Valley.",
      "34": "So the Spirit of the Lord took control of Gideon, who blew a trumpet, mustering the descendants of Abiezer to follow him into battle.",
      "35": "He sent messengers to the entire tribe of Manasseh, calling them to follow him, and he also sent word to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, calling them to meet him.",
      "36": "Then Gideon told God, “If you intend to deliver Israel by my efforts as you’ve said,",
      "37": "then take a look at this wool fleece that I’m placing on the threshing floor. If dew appears only on the fleece—and it’s dry on the ground all around it—then I’ll know that you’ll deliver Israel by my efforts like you’ve said.”",
      "38": "And that is what happened: When he got up early the next morning, he wrung out the fleece to drain the dew from it and extracted a bowl full of water.",
      "39": "Then Gideon told God, “Don’t let yourself be angry with me! I want to ask you once again: please let me make a test with the fleece just once more. Cause it to be dry only on the fleece, but let there be dew all around on the ground.”",
      "40": "And God did it just like that later that night. It was dry only on the fleece, but dew was all around on the ground."

      "3": "That’s why you’re to ask in full view of the soldiers, “Whoever is afraid or is trembling may go back from Mount Gilead and return home.” So 22,000 soldiers left and 10,000 remained.",
      "4": "“There are still too many soldiers,” the Lord told Gideon. “Bring them down to the water and I’ll refine them for you there. Therefore when I say to you, ‘This one will be going with you,’ he’ll go with you, but no one may go about whom I tell you, ‘This one won’t be going with you.’”",
      "5": "So he brought his soldiers down to the water, and the Lord told Gideon, “You are to cull out everyone who laps up water with his tongue like a dog from everyone who kneels to drink.”",
      "6": "The contingent of soldiers who lapped water with their hands to their mouths numbered 300 men, but everyone else kneeled to drink water.",
      "7": "Then the Lord told Gideon, “I’m going to deliver you with the 300 soldiers who lapped by giving the Midianites into your control. Send everyone else back to their own homes.”",
      "8": "So the soldiers took provisions with them, along with their trumpets, and Gideon sent all the rest of the soldiers of Israel back to their own tents, but he retained the 300 men. And the Midian encampment was below him in the valley.",
      "9": "Later that same night, the Lord directed Gideon, “Get up and go down to the Midianite encampment, because I’ve given it into your control.",
      "10": "But if you’re afraid to go down there, you may take your servant Purah with you to their encampment,",
      "11": "where you will hear what they’re talking about. That way, you’ll be encouraged to attack the encampment.” So he and his servant Purah went down to the perimeter outposts of the encamped army.",
      "12": "The Midianites, the Amalekites, and certain groups from the east lay encamped in the valley, as thick as locusts. The number of their camels couldn’t be calculated—they seemed as numerous as the sand on the seashore.",
      "13": "Gideon arrived just as a soldier was talking to a friend about a dream. “Look!” he was saying. “I had a dream that went like this: A loaf of barley bread rolled into the Midianite encampment, came to a tent, and collided with it. The loaf of bread fell down, turned upside down, and the tent collapsed!”",
      "14": "Then his friend replied, “Can this be anything else than the sword of Joash’s son Gideon, that man from Israel? God must have given Midian and the entire encampment into his control!”",
      "15": "When Gideon heard the tale of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down in worship and then returned to the Israeli encampment.\nThere he announced, “Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite army into your control!”",
      "16": "Then he separated the 300 men into three companies, gave them each trumpets to carry, along with jars into which he placed lit torches.",
      "17": "He instructed them, “Watch me, and do what I do. When we come to the outer perimeter of the encampment, do what I do.",
      "18": "When I sound my trumpet, accompanied by everyone who is with me, you must blow your trumpets all around the entire encampment. Then shout out, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon!’”",
      "19": "So Gideon and the 100 men with him arrived at the outer perimeter of the encampment at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had posted sentries. They blew their trumpets and smashed the jars that they were carrying in their hands.",
      "20": "When the three companies sounded their trumpets and broke the jars, they held the torches in their left hands and sounded their trumpets with their right hands. Then they cried out, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!”",
      "21": "They stood up, each soldier in his assigned place surrounding the encampment, and the entire army ran away, sounding the alarm to retreat.",
      "22": "As the 300 trumpets were being sounded, the Lord turned the swords of the Midianite soldiers against one another throughout the entire army, and the army ran away as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zererah. They got as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath.",
      "23": "Israeli soldiers were called out from the territories of Naphtali, Asher, and throughout Manasseh, and they chased after the Midianites.",
      "24": "Gideon dispatched messengers throughout the mountainous region of Ephraim, notifying them, “Come down to fight Midian. Capture the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River before they can get to them.”",
      "25": "They captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. While they were pursuing the Midianites, they executed Oreb at Oreb’s Rock and Zeeb at Zeeb’s Winepress, and then they carried the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from the east bank of the Jordan River."

      "3": "God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the leaders of Midian, into your control. What was I able to do compared to you?” When he said this, their anger calmed down.",
      "4": "Meanwhile, Gideon and the 300 soldiers with him came to the Jordan, exhausted but continuing their pursuit.",

      "6": "But the officials of Succoth replied, “Do you have Zebah and Zalmunna in custody already, so that we should give food to your army?”",
      "7": "So Gideon responded, “Very well then, but when the Lord has turned over Zebah and Zalmunna into my control, I’m going to whip you with thorns and briers from the desert!”",
      "8": "Then he left there to go to Penuel and asked the same thing from them, but the men of Penuel responded the same way the men of Succoth did.",
      "9": "So he responded the same way to the men of Penuel, “When I come back safely, I’m going to tear down this tower.”",
      "10": "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, along with their armies, about 15,000 men who survived from the entire army of the group from the east, since 120,000 swordsmen had already fallen.",
      "11": "Gideon went up by a caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked their encampment when they were off guard.",
      "12": "When Zebah and Zalmunna escaped, he pursued them, captured those two kings of Midian, and threw the entire army into a panic.",
      "13": "Then Joash’s son Gideon returned from the battle along the Heres Ascent.",
      "14": "He caught a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. He wrote out for Gideon a list of the 77 officials of Succoth, including its elders.",

      "16": "So he took the elders of the city and disciplined the men of Succoth with thorns and briers from the desert.",
      "17": "He also demolished the tower in Penuel and killed the men of the city.",

      "19": "Gideon replied, “They were my brothers—sons from my own mother. As the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn’t be killing you.”",
      "20": "Then he told his firstborn son Jether, “Get up and kill them!” But he was afraid, since he was still only a youngster.",
      "21": "Then Zebah and Zalmunna responded, “Get up and attack us yourself, since a man’s valor is only as good as the man himself.” So Gideon got up, killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the crescent-shaped necklaces that adorned the necks of their camels.",
      "22": "Then the men of Israel asked Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandsons—because you have delivered us from Midian’s domination.”",

      "25": "They responded, “We’ll be happy to give them.” So they laid out a garment, and each of them contributed a ring from his war booty.",
      "26": "The weight of the rings that he had asked for was 1,700 gold coins, not counting the crescent-shaped necklaces, pendants, and purple garments worn by the Midian kings, and also not counting the bands adorning the necks of their camels.",
      "27": "Gideon crafted the booty into an ephod and enshrined it in his home town of Ophrah. Then all of Israel committed spiritual adultery with it there, and it became a snare for Gideon and his household.",
      "28": "Midian remained subjugated to the Israelis, and they didn’t so much as raise their heads anymore, so the land was peaceful for 40 years during the lifetime of Gideon.",

      "8": "The man had left his city Bethlehem in Judah to live wherever he could. As he traveled along, he eventually arrived at Micah’s house in the mountainous region of Ephraim, looking for work.",
      "9": "Micah asked him, “Where did you come from?”\nHe replied, “I’m a descendant of Levi from Bethlehem in Judah, and I’m going to stay temporarily wherever I can find a place.”",
      "10": "So Micah replied, “Come live with me! You can be a spiritual father to me, as well as a priest. I’ll pay you ten silver coins a year, plus a priestly uniform and an income.” So the descendant of Levi moved in.",
      "11": "The descendant of Levi agreed to live with the man, and the young man became like one of the family.",
      "12": "Micah set up the descendant of Levi in ministry, and the young man became his priest while he lived in Micah’s house.",
      "13": "As for Micah, he kept saying, “Now I know the Lord will make me rich, because I have a descendant of Levi for a priest!”"

      "1": "Back in those days, Israel didn’t have a king yet, and during that time the tribe of Dan had been seeking a territorial inheritance to live in, because up until that time no territory had been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel.",
      "2": "So the tribe of Dan sent from their families five valiant men of their number from Zorah and Eshtaol to scout the land and search through it. Following their orders, which were “Go and scout the land,” they came to the mountainous region of Ephraim, arrived at Micah’s home, and stayed there.",
      "3": "As they approached Micah’s home, they recognized the voice of the young male descendant of Levi. They turned aside from there and spoke to him, asking him, “Who brought you here? What work are you doing here? And what’s your business here?”",
      "4": "He answered, “Micah did such and such for me, and has hired me, so I’ve become his priest.”",
      "5": "They replied, “Go ask God, please, about whether or not we’ll be successful in this journey.”",
      "6": "The priest responded to them, “Travel in peace. The mission that you’re to accomplish is from the Lord.”",
      "7": "So the five men left and went to Laish, and observed the people who were living there carefree, as Sidonians tend to do, in peace and quiet. There was no ruler in the land oppressing them for any reason. They were living far away from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone.",
      "8": "When they returned to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them, “What’s your report?”",
      "9": "They replied, “Let’s get going and attack them. We’ve scouted out the land—and look!—it’s a very good one. Why should we sit still? We can’t wait to go back, invade, and take over the land.",
      "10": "When you invade, you’ll meet a carefree people living in a spacious territory. God has given it into your control—it’s a place that lacks nothing on this earth!”",
      "11": "So 600 descendants of Dan from Zorah and Eshtaol set out for battle, armed with military weapons.",
      "12": "They went out and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in the territory of Judah. (That’s why they call the place Mahaneh-dan to this day. It lies west of Kiriath-jearim.)",
      "13": "They proceeded from there to the mountainous region of Ephraim and arrived at Micah’s house.",
      "14": "Then the five men who had gone to scout out the territory of Laish told their relatives, “Are you aware that in these houses there’s an ephod, some household idols, a carved image, and a cast image? You know what you need to do.”",
      "15": "So they turned aside from there, went to Micah’s house, and greeted him.",
      "16": "While the 600 Danite soldiers, armed with military weapons, stood guard at the entrance to the gate,",
      "17": "the five men who had gone to scout out the land arrived, entered Micah’s home and confiscated the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the cast image. Meanwhile, the priest stood outside by the entrance to the gate with the 600 men armed with military weapons.",
      "18": "After they went into Micah’s home and took possession of the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the cast image, the priest challenged them. “What are you doing?” he asked them.",
      "19": "They told him, “Shut up and keep quiet. Come with us and be our spiritual father and priest. It’s better for you, isn’t it, to be a priest to an entire tribe and family in Israel than to be priest to the home of one man?”",
      "20": "The priest was happy to oblige, so he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image and went along with the army.",
      "21": "Then they turned around and left, sending their little ones, their livestock, and their valuables on ahead.",
      "22": "When they had been gone a short distance from Micah’s home, some of Micah’s neighbors assembled a search party and overtook the descendants of Dan.",
      "23": "They yelled at the descendants of Dan, who turned around to face Micah and asked, “What’s wrong with you? You’ve assembled together…?”",
      "24": "Micah replied, “You took my gods that I crafted, along with the priest, and left! What do I have left? So what’s with this ‘What’s wrong with you?’”",
      "25": "The descendants of Dan answered him, “You had better not talk to us about this, or else these bad guys here will attack you. You will lose your life, along with the lives of your whole household.”",
      "26": "Then the descendants of Dan went on their way. Because Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back home.",
      "27": "But the descendants of Dan took what Micah had made, along with the priest who had worked for him, and went to Laish, to a quiet and carefree people, and killed them with swords. Then they set fire to the city.",
      "28": "They had no one else to deliver them, because they lived far from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone. It lay in the valley near Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it.",
      "29": "They renamed the city Dan, after the name of their ancestor Dan, who had been born in Israel. The former name of the city was Laish.",
      "30": "The descendants of Dan set up the carved image, and Gershom’s son Jonathan, a descendant of Manasseh, served along with his descendants as priests to the tribe of Dan until the land was taken captive.",
      "31": "Micah’s carved image, that he himself had crafted, was in place during the entire time that God’s tent was set up at Shiloh."

See how the daylight is fading, so spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Then tomorrow get up early and leave on your journey home.”",
      "10": "Because the man was unwilling to spend the night, he got up, left, and arrived opposite Jebus (now known as Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys, along with his mistress.",
      "11": "As they approached Jebus, the daylight was almost gone, so the servant suggested to his master, “Come on, let’s spend the night in this Jebusite city.”",
      "12": "But his master replied, “We’re not going to turn aside into a city of foreigners who are not part of the Israelis. Instead, we’ll go on to Gibeah.”",
      "13": "He also told his servant, “Come on, let’s go to one of these places and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”",
      "14": "So they continued on their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which is part of Benjamin’s territorial allotment.",
      "15": "They turned aside there, intending to enter Gibeah and spend the night.\nAfter they entered the city, they had to sit down in the public square because no one would take them into their home for the night.",
      "16": "Just then, an old man was coming out of the fields that evening from work. The man was from the mountainous region of Ephraim and had been staying in Gibeah, even though the men of that place were descendants of Benjamin.",
      "17": "As the old man looked up and saw the traveling man in the public square of the city, he asked, “Now then, where are you headed? And where are you from?”",
      "18": "He replied, “We’re traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the mountainous region of Ephraim, because I’m from there, and I’ve been visiting Bethlehem in Judah. I’m going home now, but no one will take me into his home.",
      "19": "Meanwhile, we also have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, for this young woman servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. We don’t need anything else.”",
