      "1": "From: Paul, called to be an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by the will of God, and from our brother Sosthenes.",
      "2": "To: God’s church in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified by the Messiah Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah—their Lord and ours.",
      "3": "May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!",
      "4": "I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given you by the Messiah Jesus.",
      "5": "For by him you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind—",
      "6": "while our testimony about the Messiah has been confirmed among you.",
      "7": "Therefore, you don’t lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus the Messiah to be revealed.",
      "8": "He will keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the Day of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.",
      "9": "Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son Jesus the Messiah, our Lord.",
      "10": "Brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, I urge all of you to be in agreement and not to have divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in your understanding and opinions.",
      "11": "My brothers, some members of Chloe’s family have made it clear to me that there are quarrels among you.",
      "12": "This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to the Messiah.”",
      "13": "Is the Messiah divided? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he? You weren’t baptized in Paul’s name, were you?",
      "14": "I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.",
      "16": "(Oh yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanas. Beyond that, I’m not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)",
      "17": "For the Messiah did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, so the cross of the Messiah won’t be emptied of its power.",
      "18": "For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God’s power to us who are being saved.",
      "19": "For it is written,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\n    and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject.”",
      "20": "Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn’t he?",
      "21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe through the nonsense of our preaching.",
      "22": "Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,",
      "23": "but we preach the Messiah crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to gentiles,",
      "24": "but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, the Messiah is God’s power and God’s wisdom.",
      "25": "For God’s nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.",
      "26": "Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.",
      "27": "But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed.",
      "28": "And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,",
      "29": "so that no one may boast in God’s presence.",
      "30": "It is because of God that you are in union with the Messiah Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.",
      "31": "Therefore, as it is written, “The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”"
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come and tell you about God’s secret with rhetorical language or wisdom.",
      "2": "For while I was with you I resolved to know nothing except Jesus the Messiah, and him crucified.",
      "3": "It was in weakness, fear, and great trembling that I came to you.",
      "4": "My message and my preaching were not accompanied by clever, wise words, but by a display of the Spirit’s power,",
      "5": "so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.",
      "6": "However, when we are among mature people, we do speak a message of wisdom, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are passing off the scene.",
      "7": "Instead, we speak about God’s wisdom in a hidden secret, which God destined before the world began for our glory.",
      "8": "None of the rulers of this world understood it, because if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
      "9": "But as it is written,\n“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,\n    and no mind has imagined\nthe things that God has prepared\n    for those who love him.”",
      "10": "But God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.",
      "11": "Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God’s Spirit.",
      "12": "Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God.",
      "13": "We don’t speak about these things with words taught us by human wisdom, but with words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people.",
      "14": "A person who isn’t spiritual doesn’t accept the things of God’s Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can’t understand them because they are spiritually evaluated.",
      "15": "The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else’s evaluation.",
      "16": "For\n“Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so that he can advise him?”\nHowever, we have the mind of the Messiah."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Brothers, I couldn’t talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as mere infants in the Messiah.",
      "2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren’t ready for it. And you’re still not ready!",
      "3": "That’s because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren’t you?",
      "4": "For when one person says, “I follow Paul,” and another person says, “I follow Apollos,” you’re following your own human nature, aren’t you?",
      "5": "Who is Apollos, anyhow? Or who is Paul? They’re merely servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept everything growing.",
      "7": "So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters.",
      "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own action.",
      "9": "For we are God’s co-workers. You are God’s farmland and God’s building.",
      "10": "As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it.",
      "11": "After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus the Messiah.",
      "12": "Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
      "13": "the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day of judgment will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s action.",
      "14": "If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.",
      "15": "If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire.",
      "16": "You know that you are God’s sanctuary and that God’s Spirit lives in you, don’t you?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys God’s sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God’s sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God’s sight. For it is written,\n“He catches the wise with their own trickery,”",
      "20": "and again,\n“The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”",
      "21": "So let no one boast about human beings, since everything belongs to you,",
      "22": "whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—everything belongs to you,",
      "23": "but you belong to the Messiah, and the Messiah belongs to God."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Think of us as servants of the Messiah and as servant managers entrusted with God’s secrets.",
      "2": "Now it is required of servant managers that each one should prove to be trustworthy.",
      "3": "It is a very small thing to me that I should be examined by you or by any human court. In fact, I don’t even evaluate myself.",
      "4": "For my conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who examines me.",
      "5": "Therefore, stop judging prematurely, before the Lord comes, for he will bring to light what is now hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of our hearts. Then each person will receive his praise from God.",
      "6": "Brothers, I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what the Scriptures say. Then you will stop boasting about one person at the expense of another.",
      "7": "For who makes you superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?",
      "8": "You already have all you want! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you!",
      "9": "For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display in last place, like men condemned to death. We have become a spectacle for the world, for angels, and for people to stare at.",
      "10": "We are fools for the Messiah’s sake, but you are wise in the Messiah. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.",
      "11": "We are hungry, thirsty, dressed in rags, brutally treated, and homeless, right up to the present.",
      "12": "We wear ourselves out from working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless. When persecuted, we endure.",
      "13": "When slandered, we answer with kind words. Even now we have become the filth of the world, the scum of the universe.",
      "14": "I’m not writing this to make you feel ashamed, but to warn you as my dear children.",
      "15": "You may have 10,000 mentors who work for the Messiah, but not many fathers. For in the Messiah Jesus I became your father through the gospel.",
      "16": "So I urge you to imitate me.",
      "17": "That’s why I sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and dependable son in the Lord and will help you remember how I live for the Messiah Jesus as I teach everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to evaluate you.",
      "19": "But I will come to you soon if it’s the Lord’s will. Then I’ll discover not only what these arrogant people are saying but also what power they have,",
      "20": "for the kingdom of God isn’t just talk, but also power.",
      "21": "Which do you prefer? Should I come to you with a stick, or with love and a gentle spirit?"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, and of a kind that is not found even among the gentiles. A man is actually living with his father’s wife!",
      "2": "And you are being arrogant instead of being filled with grief and seeing to it that the man who did this is removed from among you.",
      "3": "Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you.",
      "4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are gathered together (and I am there in spirit), and the power of our Lord Jesus is there, too,",
      "5": "turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of his body, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.",
      "6": "Your boasting is not good. You know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough, don’t you?",
      "7": "Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For the Messiah, our Passover, has been sacrificed.",
      "8": "So let’s keep celebrating the festival, neither with old yeast nor with yeast that is evil and wicked, but with yeast-free bread that is both sincere and true.",
      "9": "I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral—",
      "10": "not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, greedy, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.",
      "11": "But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. You must even stop eating with someone like that.",
      "12": "After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are in the community, aren’t you?",
      "13": "God will judge outsiders. “Expel that wicked man.”"

    "6": {
      "1": "When one of you has a complaint against another, does he dare to take the matter before those who are unrighteous and not before the saints?",

      "3": "You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don’t you?",
      "4": "So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?",
      "5": "I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers?",
      "6": "Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelieving judges, at that!",
      "7": "The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather just accept the wrong? Why not rather be cheated?",
      "8": "Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!",
      "9": "You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don’t you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,",
      "10": "thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God.",
      "11": "That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah and by the Spirit of our God.",
      "12": "Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not allow anything to control me.",
      "13": "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will make them both unnecessary. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
      "14": "God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us.",
      "15": "You know that your bodies belong to the Messiah, don’t you? Should I take what belongs to the Messiah and unite them with a prostitute? Certainly not!",
      "16": "You know that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her, don’t you? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”",
      "17": "But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him.",
      "18": "Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body.",
      "19": "You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, don’t you? You do not belong to yourselves,",
      "20": "because you were bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God with your bodies."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Now about what you asked: “Is it advisable for a man not to touch a woman inappropriately?”",
      "2": "Yes, and yet because sexual immorality is so rampant, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband.",
      "3": "A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should do the same for her husband.",
      "4": "A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but his wife does.",
      "5": "Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so just for a set time, in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control.",
      "6": "But I say this as a concession, not as a command.",
      "7": "I would like everyone to be unmarried, like I am. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that.",
      "8": "I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows: It is good for them to remain like me.",
      "9": "However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.",
      "10": "To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord): A wife must not leave her husband.",
      "11": "But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife.",
      "12": "I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her.",
      "13": "And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.",
      "15": "But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not under obligation. God has called you to live in peace.",
      "16": "Wife, you might be able to save your husband. Husband, you might be able to save your wife.",
      "17": "Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches.",
      "18": "Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised.",
      "19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God’s commandments is everything.",
      "20": "Everyone should stay in the same condition in which he was called.",
      "21": "Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity.",
      "22": "For the slave who has been called to belong to the Lord is the Lord’s free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is the Messiah’s slave.",
      "23": "You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people.",
      "24": "Brothers, everyone should stay in the same condition in which he was called by God.",
      "25": "Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.",
      "26": "In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is.",
      "27": "Have you become committed to a wife? Stop trying to get released from your commitment. Have you been freed from your commitment to a wife? Stop looking for one.",
      "28": "But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience trouble in this life, and I want to spare you from that.",
      "29": "This is what I mean, brothers: The time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,",
      "30": "and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,",
      "31": "and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away.",
      "32": "I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.",
      "33": "But a married man is concerned about things of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,",
      "34": "and so his attention is divided.\nAn unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband.",
      "35": "I’m saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.",
      "36": "If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is so strong that he feels he ought to marry her, let him do what he wants; he isn’t sinning. Let them get married.",
      "37": "However, if a man stands firm in his resolve, feels no necessity, and has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately.",
      "38": "So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better.",
      "39": "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.",
      "40": "However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And in saying this, I think that I, too, have God’s Spirit."

      "3": "But anyone who loves God is known by him.",
      "4": "Now concerning eating food offered to idols: We know that no idol is real in this world and that there is only one God.",
      "5": "For even if there are “gods” in heaven and on earth (as indeed there are many so-called “gods” and “lords”),",
      "6": "yet for us\nthere is only one God, the Father,\n    from whom everything came into being\n        and for whom we live.\nAnd there is only one Lord, Jesus the Messiah,\n    through whom everything came into being\n        and through whom we live.",
      "7": "But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idolatry that when they eat food that has been offered to an idol, their conscience becomes contaminated because it is weak.",
      "8": "However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat food that has been offered to an idol, and no better off if we do.",
      "9": "But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block for those who are weak.",
      "10": "For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you, who know better, eating in an idol’s temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won’t he?",
      "11": "In that case, the weak brother for whom the Messiah died is ruined by your knowledge.",
      "12": "When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against the Messiah.",

      "8": "I am not saying this on human authority, am I? The Law says the same thing, doesn’t it?",

      "12": "If others enjoy this right over you, don’t we have a stronger claim? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we tolerate everything in order not to put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of the Messiah.",
      "13": "You know that those who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple and that those who serve at the altar get their share of its offerings, don’t you?",
      "14": "In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel.",
