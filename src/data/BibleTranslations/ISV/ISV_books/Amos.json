      "9": "“Look! I’m giving the order:\n    I will sift the house of Israel throughout all the nations,\n        as one sifts with a sieve,\n    yet not a single kernel will reach the ground!",
      "10": "All sinners among my people will die by the sword,\n    especially all who are saying,\n        ‘Disaster will not come upon or conquer us!’”",
      "11": "“At that time I will restore David’s fallen tent,\n    restoring its torn places.\nI will restore its ruins,\n    rebuilding it as it was long ago,",

      "14": "I will surely restore my people Israel;\n    they will rebuild the ruined cities\n        and inhabit them.\nThey will plant vineyards\n    and drink the wine from them.\nThey will plant gardens\n    and eat the fruit from them.",
      "15": "I will plant the people of Israel in their own land,\n    never again to be torn out of their land\n        that I gave them,”\n    says the Lord your God."
