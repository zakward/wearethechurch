      "3": "a message from the Lord came directly to Buzi’s son Ezekiel, the priest, by the Chebar River in the land of the Chaldeans. The hand of the Lord rested upon him there.",
      "4": "I was amazed to see a wind storm blow in from the north, consisting of a massive cloud and fire that was flashing back and forth, surrounded by bright light. From deep within the cloud, something was shining that appeared to have a color like bronze that had been placed in fire until it glowed.",
      "5": "Deep inside it, the likenesses of four living beings were visible. Their appearances were similar to human forms,",
      "6": "except that they each had four faces, four pairs of wings,",
      "7": "and straight legs. Their feet resembled calves’ hooves, but they gleamed like polished bronze.",

      "9": "their pairs of wings overlapped each other. They moved in straight directions without turning their faces around as they moved.",

      "11": "That’s what their faces were like. Their wings spread out above and around them, one pair overlapping another, with one pair covering themselves.",
      "12": "Each moved in straight directions. Wherever they decided to go, they went without turning themselves.",
      "13": "Now, in the midst of the living beings there was something that appeared to glow like coals kindled by a fire, like torches that moved back and forth between the living beings. The fire was dazzling, and lightning flashed from the fire.",

      "15": "As I observed the living beings, I noticed one wheel on the earth beside each being—that is, for the four of them.",
      "16": "Their wheels and their construction details looked like gold-colored beryl. Each wheel was identical in form to the others, and they appeared to have been constructed and designed as if one wheel were within another.",
      "17": "Whenever the four moved, no matter which of four directions, they moved without turning around.",
      "18": "Their wheel rims were ornate and terrifying. They were full of eyes that surrounded the four of them.",
      "19": "Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved, too. Whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also.",
      "20": "Whatever direction these spirits went, the wheels would be lifted up along with them, because the wheels were alive.",
      "21": "They moved around whenever they wanted to move around, and they stood still whenever they wanted to stand still; and whenever they rose from the earth, the wheels remained close beside them, because the wheels were also alive.",
      "22": "There was spread out over the heads of the living beings what looked like a canopy, in outward appearance resembling ice,",
      "23": "and underneath the canopy, their wings spread out straight over their heads toward each other. They each also had two wings with which they covered themselves, one wing covering its body on one side and one wing covering itself on the other side.",
      "24": "I also heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of roaring water, like the voice of the Almighty, or like a boisterous crowd within an army camp. Whenever they stopped flying, they lowered their wings.",
      "25": "A sound came from above the canopy that was spread out over their heads. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.",
      "26": "From above the canopy that was spread out over their heads, there appeared to be something reminiscent of a throne, resembling sapphire in form.\nThere was the likeness of the appearance of a human being seated on the likeness of the throne high above.",
      "27": "I noticed that from what appeared to look like his waist upward there was something that looked like metal that glowed as if it were immersed in fire. Below this there was something resembling fire, with a radiant light surrounding him.",
      "28": "The appearance of the radiant light resembled that of a rainbow shining in a cloud on a rainy day. This was what the appearance of the form of the glory of the Lord resembled. When I saw all of this, I fell flat on my face. Then I heard a voice speaking."

      "3": "Then he told me, “Son of Man, fill your stomach and digest this scroll that I’m giving you.” So I ate it, and it was like sweet honey in my mouth.",
      "4": "Then he told me, “Son of Man, go to the house of Israel and tell them what I have to say to them,",
      "5": "because you’re not going to a people whose speech you cannot understand or whose language is difficult to speak. Instead, you’re going to the house of Israel.",

      "7": "But the house of Israel won’t listen to you, since they weren’t willing to listen to me. That’s because the entire house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.",
      "8": "So pay attention! I’m going to make you just as obstinate and unyielding as they are.",
      "9": "I’m making you harder than flint—like diamond! So you are not to fear them or be intimidated by how they look at you, since they’re a rebellious group.”",

      "13": "accompanied by the sound of the wings of the living creatures gently touching each other and with the sound of the wheels emanating from the front, accompanied by a great earthquake.",
      "14": "Then the Spirit lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly with an angry attitude as the hand of the Lord rested on me.",
      "15": "I came to the exiles at Tel-abib by the Chebar River and sat down among them for seven days, appalled.",
      "16": "At the end of the seven days, this message from the Lord came to me:",
      "17": "“Son of Man,” he said, “I’ve appointed you to be a watchman over the house of Israel. Therefore when you hear a message that comes from me, you are to warn them for me.",
      "18": "“So when I say to a wicked person, ‘You’re about to die,’ if you don’t warn or instruct that wicked person that his behavior is wicked so he can live, that wicked person will die in his sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for his death.",
      "19": "If you warn the wicked person, and he doesn’t repent of his wickedness or of his wicked behavior, he’ll die in his sin, but you will have saved your own life.",
      "20": "“When a righteous man abandons his righteousness to practice unrighteousness, I’ll set a stumbling block before him. He’ll die. If you don’t warn him, he’ll die in his sin and the righteous deeds that he had practiced won’t be remembered, but you’ll be held responsible for his death.",
      "21": "If you warn the righteous person, so that he doesn’t commit sin, then he’ll live, since he had been warned. And you will have saved your life.”",

      "24": "The Spirit entered me, rested on me, caused me to stand on my feet, and then he spoke to me. This is what he had to say: “Go barricade yourself in your house.",
      "25": "Now pay attention! They’re going to bind you with ropes, tying you up right in their midst, so you won’t be able to circulate freely among them.",
      "26": "Meanwhile, I’ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you’ll be mute and unable to reprove them, since they’re a rebellious group.",
      "27": "But when I speak with you, I’ll open your mouth so you can say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:\n“As for those who will listen,\n    ‘Let them listen,’\nbut as for those who refuse,\n    ‘Let them refuse,’\n        since they’re a rebellious group.”’”"
