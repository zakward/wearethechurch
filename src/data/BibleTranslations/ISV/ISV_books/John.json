    "1": {
      "1": "In the beginning, the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He existed in the beginning with God.",
      "3": "Through him all things were made, and apart from him nothing was made that has been made.",
      "4": "In him was life, and that life brought light to humanity.",
      "5": "And the light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe because of him.",
      "8": "John was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.",
      "9": "This was the true light that enlightens every person by his coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not recognize him.",
      "11": "He came to his own creation, yet his own people did not receive him.",
      "12": "However, to all who received him, those believing in his name, he gave authority to become God’s children,",
      "13": "who were born, not merely in a genetic sense, nor from lust, nor from man’s desire, but from the will of God.",
      "14": "The Word became flesh and lived among us. We gazed on his glory, the kind of glory that belongs to the Father’s uniquely existing Son, who is full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John told the truth about him when he cried out, “This is the person about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me ranks higher than me, because he existed before me.’”",
      "16": "We have all received one gracious gift after another from his abundance,",
      "17": "because while the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus the Messiah.",
      "18": "No one has ever seen God. The uniquely existing God, who is close to the Father’s side, has revealed him.",
      "19": "This was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and descendants of Levi to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He spoke openly and, remaining true to himself, admitted, “I am not the Messiah.”",
      "21": "So they asked him, “Well then, are you Elijah?”\nJohn said, “I am not.”\n“Are you the Prophet?”\nHe answered, “No.”",
      "22": "“Who are you?” they asked him. “We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He replied, “I am\n‘…a voice crying out in the wilderness,\n    “Prepare the Lord’s highway,”’\nas the prophet Isaiah said.”",
      "24": "Now those men had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "They asked him, “Why, then, are you baptizing if you are not the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, “I am baptizing with water, but among you stands a man whom you do not know,",
      "27": "the one who is coming after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie.”",
      "28": "This happened in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks above me, because he existed before me.’",
      "31": "I didn’t recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”",
      "32": "John also testified, “I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.",
      "33": "I didn’t recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The person on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I have seen this and have testified that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "The next day, John was standing there again with two of his disciples.",
      "36": "As he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "But when Jesus turned around and saw them following, he asked them, “What are you looking for?”\nThey asked him, “Rabbi,” (which is translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”",
      "39": "He told them, “Come and see!” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.",
      "40": "Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.",
      "41": "The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him, “We have found the Anointed One!” (which is translated “Messiah”).",
      "42": "He led Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him intently and said, “You are Simon, John’s son. You will be called Cephas!” (which is translated “Peter”).",
      "43": "The next day, Jesus decided to go away to Galilee, where he found Philip and told him, “Follow me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathaniel and told him, “We have found the man about whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote—Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”",
      "46": "Nathaniel asked him, “From Nazareth? Can anything good come from there?”\nPhilip told him, “Come and see!”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him, “Look, a genuine Israeli, in whom there is no deceit!”",
      "48": "Nathaniel asked him, “How do you know me?”\nJesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus told him, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.”",
      "51": "Then he told him, “Truly, I tell all of you emphatically, you will see heaven standing open and the angels of God going up and coming down to the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day of that week there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,",
      "2": "and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother told him, “They don’t have any more wine.”",
      "4": "“How does that concern us, dear lady?” Jesus asked her. “My time hasn’t come yet.”",
      "5": "His mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”",
      "6": "Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from two to three measures.",
      "7": "Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the man in charge of the banquet.” So they did.",
      "9": "When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom",
      "10": "and told him, “Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!”",
      "11": "Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
      "12": "After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they remained there for a few days.",
      "13": "The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "In the Temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables.",
      "15": "After making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the Temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables.",
      "16": "Then he told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "Then the Jewish leaders asked him, “What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will rebuild it.”",
      "20": "The Jewish leaders said, “This sanctuary has been under construction for 46 years, and you’re going to rebuild it in three days?”",
      "21": "But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body.",
      "22": "After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made.",
      "23": "While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in him because they saw the signs that he was doing.",
      "24": "Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people",
      "25": "and didn’t need anyone to tell him what people were like, because he himself knew what was in every person."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now there was a man from the Pharisees, a leader of the Jews, whose name was Nicodemus.",
      "2": "He came to Jesus at night and told him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, because no one can perform these signs that you are doing unless God is with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus replied to him, “Truly, I tell you emphatically, unless a person is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus asked him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He can’t go back into his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly, I tell you emphatically, unless a person is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Don’t be astonished that I told you, ‘All of you must be born from above.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it wants to. You hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. That’s the way it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus asked him, “How can that be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered him, “You’re the teacher of Israel, and you can’t understand this?",
      "11": "Truly, I tell you emphatically, we know what we’re talking about, and we testify about what we’ve seen. Yet you people do not accept our testimony.",
      "12": "If I have told you people about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?",
      "13": "“No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.",
      "14": "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "so that everyone who believes in him would have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For this is how God loved the world: He gave his uniquely existing Son so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal life.",
      "17": "Because God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world would be saved through him.",
      "18": "Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s uniquely existing Son.",
      "19": "And this is the basis for judgment: The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their actions were evil.",
      "20": "Everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his actions may not be exposed.",
      "21": "But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may become evident that his actions have God’s approval.”",
      "22": "After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing.",
      "23": "John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,",
      "24": "since John had not yet been thrown into prison.",
      "25": "Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between a certain Jew and John’s disciples,",
      "26": "so they went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he’s baptizing, and everyone is going to him!”",
      "27": "John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to them from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.’",
      "29": "It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom’s friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That’s why this joy of mine is now complete.",
      "30": "He must become more important, but I must become less important.”",
      "31": "The one who comes from above is superior to everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to everything.",
      "32": "He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.",
      "33": "The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful.",
      "34": "The one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure to him.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.",
      "36": "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him."

    "4": {
      "1": "Now when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John—",
      "2": "although it was not Jesus who did the baptizing but his disciples—",
      "3": "he left Judea and went back to Galilee.",
      "4": "Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.",
      "5": "So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s Well was also there, and Jesus, tired out by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.",
      "7": "A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus told her, “Please give me a drink,”",
      "8": "since his disciples had gone off into town to buy food.",
      "9": "The Samaritan woman asked him, “How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” Because Jews do not have anything to do with Samaritans.",
      "10": "Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Please give me a drink,’ you would have been the one to ask him, and he would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "The woman told him, “Sir, you don’t have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water?",
      "12": "You’re not greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it, along with his sons and his flocks, are you?”",
      "13": "Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again.",
      "14": "But whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never become thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become a well of water for him, springing up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman told him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I won’t get thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”",
      "16": "He told her, “Go and call your husband, and come back here.”",
      "17": "The woman answered him, “I don’t have a husband.”\nJesus told her, “You are quite right in saying, ‘I don’t have a husband,’",
      "18": "because you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.”",
      "19": "The woman told him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet!",
      "20": "Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain. But you Jews say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem.”",
      "21": "Jesus told her, “Believe me, dear lady, the hour is coming when you Samaritans will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You don’t know what you’re worshiping. We Jews know what we’re worshiping, because salvation comes from the Jews.",
      "23": "Yet the time is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. Indeed, the Father is looking for people like that to worship him.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”",
      "25": "The woman told him, “I know that the Anointed One is coming, who is being called ‘the Messiah’. When that person comes, he will explain everything.”",
      "26": "“I AM,” Jesus replied, “the one who is speaking to you.”",
      "27": "At this point his disciples arrived, and they were astonished that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want from her?” or, “Why are you talking to her?”",
      "28": "Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told people,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything I’ve ever done! Could he possibly be the Messiah?”",
      "30": "The people left the town and started on their way to him.",
      "31": "Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, have something to eat.”",
      "32": "But he told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”",
      "33": "So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?”",
      "34": "Jesus told them, “My food is doing the will of the one who sent me and completing his work.",
      "35": "You say, don’t you, ‘In four more months the harvest will begin?’ Look, I tell you, open your eyes and observe that the fields are ready for harvesting now!",
      "36": "The one who harvests is already receiving his wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who harvests may rejoice together.",
      "37": "In this respect the saying is true: ‘One person sows, and another person harvests.’",
      "38": "I have sent you to harvest what you have not worked for. Others have worked, and you have adopted their work as your own.”",
      "39": "Now many of the Samaritans of that town believed in Jesus because the woman had testified, “He told me everything I’ve ever done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.",
      "41": "And many more believed because of what he said.",
      "42": "They kept telling the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, because now we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the Savior of the world.”",
      "43": "Two days later, Jesus left for Galilee from there,",
      "44": "since Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
      "45": "When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen everything that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival and because they, too, had gone to the festival.",
      "46": "So Jesus returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Meanwhile, in Capernaum there was a government official whose son was ill.",
      "47": "When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him repeatedly to come down and heal his son, because he was about to die.",
      "48": "Jesus told him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”",
      "49": "The official told him, “Sir, please come down before my little boy dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus told him, “Go home. Your son will live.” The man believed what Jesus told him and started back home.",
      "51": "While he was on his way, his servants met him and told him that his child was alive.",
      "52": "So he asked them at what hour he had begun to recover, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon.”",
      "53": "Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole family.",
      "54": "Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee."

      "2": "Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It has five colonnades,",
      "3": "and under these a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, or paralyzed—waiting for the movement of the water.",
      "4": "At certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water, and whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.",
      "5": "One particular man was there who had been ill for 38 years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”",
      "7": "The sick man answered him, “Sir, I don’t have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I’m trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me.”",
      "8": "Jesus told him, “Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!”",
      "9": "The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath.",
      "10": "So the Jewish leaders told the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.",
      "11": "But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”",
      "12": "They asked him, “Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”",
      "13": "But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place.",
      "14": "Later on, Jesus found him in the Temple and told him, “Look! You have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”",
      "15": "The man went off and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.",

      "7": "and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus’ head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place.",
      "8": "Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed.",
      "9": "For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that Jesus had to rise from the dead.",
      "10": "So the disciples went back to their homes.",
      "11": "Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb.",
      "12": "She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus’ body had been lying.",
      "13": "They asked her, “Lady, why are you crying?”\nShe told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have put him.”",
      "14": "After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus.",
      "15": "Jesus asked her, “Dear lady, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”\nThinking he was the gardener, she told him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”",
      "16": "Jesus told her, “Mary!”\nShe turned around and told him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means “Teacher”).",
      "17": "Jesus told her, “Don’t hold on to me, because I haven’t yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I’m ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”",
      "18": "So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I’ve seen the Lord!” She also told them what he had told her.",
      "19": "It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood among them. He told them, “Peace be with you.”",
      "20": "After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord, the disciples were overjoyed.",
      "21": "Jesus told them again, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.”",
      "22": "When he had said this, he breathed on them and told them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.",
      "23": "If you forgive people’s sins, they are forgiven. If you retain people’s sins, they are retained.”",
      "24": "Thomas, one of the Twelve (called the Twin), wasn’t with them when Jesus came.",
      "25": "So the other disciples kept telling him, “We’ve seen the Lord!” But he told them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I’ll never believe!”",
      "26": "A week later, his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said, “Peace be with you.”",
      "27": "Then he told Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, but believe.”",
      "28": "Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”",
      "29": "Jesus told him, “Is it because you’ve seen me that you have believed? How blessed are those who have never seen me and yet have believed!”",
      "30": "Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.",
      "31": "But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name."

      "2": "Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together.",
      "3": "Simon Peter told them, “I’m going fishing.”\nThey all told him, “We’ll go with you, too.” So they went out and got into the boat but didn’t catch a thing that night.",
      "4": "Just as dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn’t realize it was Jesus.",
      "5": "Jesus asked them, “Children, you don’t have any fish, do you?”\nThey answered him, “No.”",
      "6": "He told them, “Throw the net on the right hand side of the boat, and you’ll catch some.” So they threw it out and were unable to haul it in because it was so full of fish.",
      "7": "That disciple whom Jesus kept loving told Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his clothes back on, because he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea.",
      "8": "But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about 200 cubits away from the shore.",
      "9": "When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread.",
      "10": "Jesus told them, “Bring me some of the fish you’ve just caught.”",
      "11": "So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish—153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn.",
      "12": "Then Jesus told them, “Come, have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”, because they knew it was the Lord.",
      "13": "Jesus took the bread, gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.",
      "14": "This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.",
      "15": "When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”\nPeter told him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”\nJesus told him, “Feed my lambs.”",
      "16": "Then he asked him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\nPeter told him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”\nJesus told him, “Take care of my sheep.”",
      "17": "He asked him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\nPeter was deeply hurt that he had asked him a third time, “Do you love me?” So he told him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!”\nJesus told him, “Feed my sheep.",
      "18": "“Truly, I tell you emphatically, when you were young, you would fasten your belt and go wherever you liked. But when you get old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don’t want to go.”",
      "19": "Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God.\nAfter saying this, Jesus told him, “Keep following me.”",
      "20": "Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus’ chest at the supper and had asked, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”",
      "21": "When Peter saw him, he said, “Lord, what about him?”",
      "22": "Jesus told him, “If it’s my will for him to remain until I come back, how does that concern you? You must keep following me!”",
      "23": "So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn’t going to die. Yet Jesus didn’t say to Peter that he wasn’t going to die, but, “If it’s my will for him to remain until I come back, how does that concern you?”",
      "24": "This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.",
      "25": "Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down, the world couldn’t contain the books that would be written."
