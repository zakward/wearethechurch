      "3": "After he had suffered, he had shown himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during a period of 40 days and telling them about the kingdom of God.",
      "4": "While he was meeting with them, he ordered them, “Don’t leave Jerusalem. Instead, wait for what the Father has promised, about which you heard me speak,",
      "5": "because John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit a few days from now.”",
      "6": "Now those who had gathered together began to ask Jesus, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”",
      "7": "He answered them, “It isn’t for you to know what times or periods the Father has fixed by his own authority.",
      "8": "But you’ll receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you’ll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”",
      "9": "After saying this, Jesus was taken up while those who had gathered together were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight.",
      "10": "While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, two men in white robes stood right beside them.",
      "11": "They asked, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven.”",
      "12": "Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.",
      "13": "When they came into the city, these men went to the upstairs room where they had been staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.",
      "14": "With one mind, all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women (including Mary the mother of Jesus) and his brothers.",
      "15": "At that time, Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,",
      "16": "“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus,",
      "17": "because he was one of our number and was appointed to share in this ministry.”",

      "22": "beginning when he was baptized by John until the day he was taken up from us. Therefore, someone like this must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”",
      "23": "So they nominated two men—Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias.",
      "24": "Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen",
      "25": "to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas left to go to his own place.”",

      "7": "Stunned and amazed, they asked, “All of these people who are speaking are Galileans, aren’t they?",
      "8": "So how is it that each one of us hears them speaking in his own native language:",

      "15": "These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it’s only nine o’clock in the morning.",
      "16": "Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:",

      "24": "But God raised him up, putting an end to the suffering of death, since it was impossible for him to be held by it,",

      "26": "That is why my heart is glad\n    and my tongue rejoices,\n        yes, even my body still rests securely in hope.",

      "29": "“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day.",
      "30": "Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,",
      "31": "he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah:\n‘He was not abandoned to Hades,\n    and his flesh did not experience decay.’",
      "32": "“It was this very Jesus whom God raised—and we’re all witnesses of that.",
      "33": "He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has caused you to experience what you are seeing and hearing.",

      "38": "Peter answered them, “Every one of you must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift.",
      "39": "For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are distant, whom the Lord our God may call to himself.”",
      "40": "Using many different expressions, Peter continued to testify and to plead: “Be saved,” he urged them, “from this corrupt generation!”",
      "41": "So those who welcomed his message were baptized. That day about 3,000 people were added to their number.",
      "42": "The believers continued to devote themselves to what the apostles were teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer.",

      "12": "When Peter saw this, he told the people: “Fellow Israelis, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk?",
      "13": "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.",
      "14": "You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer released to you,",

      "20": "so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, whom he appointed long ago to be the Messiah.",
      "21": "He must remain in heaven until the time of universal restitution, which God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets.",
