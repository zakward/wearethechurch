      "1": "Moab rebelled against Israel after Ahab died.",
      "2": "Meanwhile, Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper room in Samaria and lay injured. He sent messengers to Ekron with these orders: “Go and consult with Ekron’s god Baal-zebub to find out if I’m going to recover from this injury.”",
      "3": "But the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the foreigner, “Get up and go meet the messengers from the king of Samaria. Ask them ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you’re going to consult with Ekron’s god Baal-zebub?",
      "4": "Now therefore this is what the Lord says: “You won’t be getting up from that bed of yours on which you’re lying. You will most certainly die!”’” So Elijah got up and went.",
      "5": "The messengers returned to the king and he asked them, “What’s this? You’ve come back?”",
      "6": "They replied, “We met a man who told us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and ask him, “Is it because there is no God in Israel that you’re going to consult with Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you won’t be getting up from that bed on which you’re lying. You will most certainly die!”’”",
      "7": "He told them, “Describe the man who met you and told you these things.”",
      "8": "They answered, “The man was a hairy fellow. He wore a leather sash around his waist.”\nThe king responded, “It’s Elijah, that foreigner!”",
      "9": "So the king sent out 50 men, along with their leader. The leader approached Elijah, who was sitting at the top of a hill. He ordered Elijah, “Hey, man of God! The king orders you to come down!”",
      "10": "Elijah responded to the leader who was in charge of the 50 soldiers, “So I’m a man of God, am I? If so, may fire fall from heaven and devour you and your 50 soldiers…” Just then, fire fell from heaven and devoured that leader and his 50 soldiers.",
      "11": "Later the king tried again—he sent another company of 50 soldiers, along with their leader, who ordered Elijah, “Hey, man of God! This is what the king orders: ‘Come down!’”",
      "12": "Elijah responded to the leader and to his entire company, “So I’m a man of God, am I? If so, may fire fall from heaven and devour you and your 50 soldiers…” Just then, fire fell from heaven and devoured him and his 50 soldiers.",
      "13": "Then the king tried yet again! The king sent a third company of 50 soldiers along with their leader. The third leader went up the hill, approached Elijah, fell on his knees in front of him, and begged him, “Hey, man of God, please treat my life and the lives of these servants of yours as precious!",
      "14": "Look how fire fell from heaven and devoured the two other companies of 50 soldiers, along with their captains, but now please treat me as if my life were precious!”",
      "15": "The angel of the Lord told Elijah, “Go down the hill with that man. Don’t be afraid of him!” So Elijah got up and went down with him to meet the king.",
      "16": "Then Elijah spoke to the king, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Since you sent messengers to consult with Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel with whom to consult regarding his word?—therefore you’re not getting up from the bed on which you’re lying. You certainly will die!’”",
      "17": "And die he did, just as the Lord had said and just as Elijah had spoken!\nAfter this, Jehoram ascended to the throne during the second year of the reign of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram from Judah. He took the place of Ahaziah, who had no son.",
      "18": "The rest of Ahaziah’s activities are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?"

      "1": "As the time drew near when the Lord was about to take Elijah to heaven in a wind storm, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.",
      "2": "Elijah instructed Elisha, “Remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me as far as Bethel.”\nBut Elisha replied, “As the Lord lives, I’m not going to leave you while you’re still alive!” So they both went on to Bethel.",
      "3": "When the Guild of Prophets who lived in Bethel came out to greet Elisha, they asked him, “You are aware, aren’t you, that later today the Lord is going to remove your master from being your mentor?”\n“Of course I’m aware of it,” he said. “Calm down.”",
      "4": "Elijah also spoke to him, “Elisha, remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me to Jericho.”\nBut Elisha responded, “As the Lord lives, and while you’re still alive, I’m not going to leave you!” So they went to Jericho.",
      "5": "The Guild of Prophets who lived in Jericho approached Elisha and asked him, “You are aware, aren’t you, that later today the Lord is going to remove your master from being your mentor?”\n“Of course I’m aware of it,” he said. “Calm down.”",
      "6": "Elijah also spoke to him, “Elisha, remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me to the Jordan River.”\nBut Elisha responded, “As the Lord lives, and while you’re still alive, I’m not going to leave you!” So they went on their way,",
      "7": "accompanied by 50 men from the Guild of Prophets, who stood at a short distance from them while they were both standing by the Jordan.",
      "8": "Elijah took off his ornamented cloak, wrapped it up in a roll, struck the water, and all of a sudden the water divided into two parts! One side of the river stood still opposite the other until the two of them crossed over on dry ground.",
      "9": "When they had crossed the Jordan River, Elijah invited Elisha, “Ask me what you want me to do for you before I’m taken away from you.”\nSo Elisha asked, “Please, may there be a double portion of your spirit upon me!”",
      "10": "“That’s a hard thing to ask for,” Elijah answered, “but if you see me while I’m being taken from you, it will happen for you. But if you don’t see me, it won’t happen.”",
      "11": "As they continued on, talking as they went, suddenly chariots blazing with fire and pulled by fiery horses appeared, separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a wind storm to heaven!",
      "12": "As Elisha continued to watch, he cried out, “My father! My father! The chariots of Israel and its cavalry!” Then he did not see Elijah anymore.\nAfter this, Elisha gripped his clothes that he was wearing, tore them apart into two pieces,",
      "13": "picked up Elijah’s ornamented cloak that had fallen from him, and went back to stand on the bank of the Jordan River.",
      "14": "Elisha took hold of Elijah’s ornamental cloak that had been left behind, struck the water, and cried out: “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” All of a sudden, after he had struck the water, the water divided into two parts! One side of the river stood opposite the other, and Elisha crossed over.",
      "15": "As soon as the Guild of Prophets who lived adjacent to Jericho saw Elisha, they began to announce, “The spirit of Elijah is at rest on Elisha!” So they came out to meet him and they greeted him by bowing low to the ground in front of him.",
      "16": "Then they asked Elisha, “Look! We have 50 valiant men here with your servant! Please let them go out and search for your master Elijah. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up on a mountain or into a valley.”\nElisha responded, “Don’t bother searching.”",
      "17": "But they persisted until he was frustrated, so he said, “Send them out!” So they sent out the 50 men, and they looked around for three days but did not find Elijah.",
      "18": "By the time they returned, Elisha was living in Jericho. Then Elisha asked them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”",
      "19": "The men who lived in the city addressed Elisha. “Look now,” they said, “our city’s location is good, as you have been observing, but the water springs here are bad and the land isn’t sustaining crops.”",
      "20": "Elisha ordered them, “Bring me a new bowl and put some salt in it.” So they brought him what he had requested.",
      "21": "Elisha went out to the springs, threw the salt into them, and declared, “This is what the Lord says: ‘I have purified these waters. Neither death nor barrenness is to flow from them anymore.’”",
      "22": "As a result, the water springs remain pure to this day, just as Elisha had declared.",
      "23": "Later, Elisha left there to go up to Bethel, and as he was traveling along the road, some insignificant young men came from the city and started mocking him. They told him, “Get on up, baldy! Get on up, baldy!”",
      "24": "He looked behind him, took note of the young men, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Suddenly two female bears emerged from the woods and mauled 42 of the young men.",
      "25": "After this, he left from there to go to Mt. Carmel, and from there he went back to Samaria."

      "1": "Ahab’s son Jehoram ascended to the throne of Israel at Samaria during the eighteenth year of the reign of Judah’s King Jehoshaphat. He reigned for twelve years,",
      "2": "practicing evil in the Lord’s presence, only not to the extent that his mother and father had done—he forced abolition of the sacred pillar to Baal that his father had crafted.",
      "3": "Even so, he kept on committing the sins that Nebat’s son Jeroboam had done, which ensnared Israel in sin—he never abandoned them.",
      "4": "Meanwhile, Moab’s King Mesha was a sheep breeder. He used to pay 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams to the king of Israel as tribute.",
      "5": "After Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "So King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and mustered the entire army of Israel.",
      "7": "As he was going out, he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight Moab?”\n“I’m coming,” Jehoshaphat replied. “I’m like you! My army will act like your army and my cavalry like your cavalry,” Then Jehoshaphat added:",
      "8": "“What road do we take?”\nJehoram answered, “We’ll go along the Edom desert road.”",
      "9": "So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom made a complete circuit on the road for seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the livestock that accompanied them.",
      "10": "Then the king of Israel remarked, “Oh no! The Lord has summoned us three kings so he can hand us over to Moab, hasn’t he?”",
      "11": "Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet who belongs to the Lord and through whom we can ask the Lord a question?”\nOne of the king of Israel’s attendants replied, “Shaphat’s son Elisha lives here. He used to be Elijah’s personal attendant.”",
      "12": "Jehoshaphat answered, “He receives messages from the Lord.” So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went to visit Elisha.",
      "13": "Elisha asked the king of Israel, “What do I have in common with you? Go visit your parents’ prophets.”\nThe king of Israel replied, “No! The Lord has summoned these three kings so he can hand them over to Moab!”",
      "14": "But Elisha responded, “As the Lord of the Heavenly Armies lives, in whose presence I stand, I would never pay attention to you or even look in your direction were it not for my continuous respect for the presence of King Jehoshaphat of Judah.",
      "15": "Now bring me a musician.”\nAs the musician played, the hand of the Lord rested on Elisha,",
      "16": "so he said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Fill this valley with trench after trench!’",
      "17": "This is what the Lord says: ‘Though you won’t see wind or storm, nevertheless that river will overflow with water so that you, your cattle, and your livestock may drink.’",
      "18": "And this is the easy part for the Lord—he’s also going to hand the Moabites over to you!",
      "19": "Then you are to attack every fortified city and every significant city. Cut down every significant tree, fill in all of the water springs, and ruin every prime piece of land with stones.”",
      "20": "The very next day, about the time of the morning offering, water suddenly appeared, coming from the direction of Edom, and the land overflowed with water!",
      "21": "Meanwhile, all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to attack them, so everyone old enough to wear battle armor was mustered to stand guard at the border.",
      "22": "As the Moabites arose early that morning, the sun cast its rays on the water, and to the Moabites, the water across from them appeared to be red like blood.",
      "23": "So they concluded, “This must be blood! The kings must have had one mighty big fight and each man killed the other! So let’s go get the battle spoil, Moab!”",
      "24": "But when the Moabites arrived at the Israeli encampment, the Israelis got up and attacked them. The Moabites ran away from the Israelis, who followed them into the land as they continued their pursuit against Moab.",
      "25": "They destroyed their cities, and all of them threw stones onto every piece of farm land, ruining the fields. Then they filled in all the water wells and chopped down all of the useful trees. Stone walls remained surrounding Kir-hareseth only, until the archers surrounded and attacked that city.",
      "26": "When the king of Moab realized that the battle was going strongly against him, he took 700 expert swordsmen to attempt to break through to the king of Edom, but was unable to do so.",
      "27": "So he took his firstborn son, whom he intended to reign after him, and offered him up as a burnt offering on the wall. There subsequently came great anger against Israel, so they abandoned the attack and returned to their homeland."

      "1": "Now there happened to be a certain woman who had been the wife of a member of the Guild of Prophets. She cried out to Elisha, “My husband who served you has died, and you know that your servant feared the Lord. But a creditor has come to take away my children into indentured servitude!”",
      "2": "Elisha responded, “What shall I do for you? Tell me what you have in your house.”\nShe replied, “Your servant has nothing in the entire house except for a flask of oil.”",
      "3": "He told her, “Go out to all of your neighbors in the surrounding streets and borrow lots of pots from them. Don’t get just a few empty vessels, either.",
      "4": "Then go in and shut the door behind you, taking only your children, and pour oil into all of the pots. As each one is filled, set it aside.”",
      "5": "So she left Elisha, shut the door behind her and her children, and while they kept on bringing vessels to her, she kept on pouring oil.",
      "6": "When the last of the vessels had been filled, she told her son, “Bring me another pot!”\nBut he replied, “There isn’t even one pot left.” Then the oil stopped flowing.",
      "7": "After this, she went and told the man of God what had happened. So he said, “Go sell the oil, pay your debt, and you and your children will be able to live on the proceeds.”",
      "8": "Some time later, Elisha went to Shunem, where he met a prominent and wealthy woman who persuaded him to have a meal with her. As a result, whenever he was in the area, he stopped by to eat with her.",
      "9": "So she had a talk with her husband. “Look here! I’ve learned that this is a holy and godly man who comes by here on a regular basis.",
      "10": "Now then, let’s build a small upper room and put a bed in it for him there, along with a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. That way, when he comes to visit, he can rest there.”",
      "11": "One day, Elisha came by to visit and stopped in to rest in the upper chamber.",
      "12": "He told his attendant Gehazi, “Call this Shunammite.” So when he had summoned her, she stood in front of him.",
      "13": "Elisha told him, “Ask her, ‘Look how you’ve gone to all this trouble to care for us! What can I do for you? Do you wish to be mentioned to the king or to the head of the army?’”\nShe replied, “I’m at home living among my own people.”",
      "14": "He responded, “What, then, is to be done on her behalf?”\nGehazi answered, “Well, she has no son and her husband is growing old.”",
      "15": "“Call her,” Elisha ordered. After he called her, she came and stood in the doorway,",
      "16": "and he told her, “About this time next year you will be embracing a son.”\n“No, sir! Please, as a godly man, don’t mislead your servant!”",
      "17": "But the woman did conceive and did bear a son at that very same time the next year, just as Elisha had told her.",
      "18": "After the child had grown up a bit, one day he went out to visit his father, who was with the harvesters.",
      "19": "He told his father, “My head! My head!”\nSo his father ordered his servant, “Carry him over to his mother!”",
      "20": "So the servant carried him over to his mother, where he rested on her lap until mid-day, and then he died.",
      "21": "The woman went upstairs, laid him on the bed belonging to the man of God, and shut the door, leaving him behind as she left.",
      "22": "Then she called to her husband and asked him, “Please send me one of the servants, along with one of the donkeys, so I can ride quickly to see that godly man. I’ll be right back.”",
      "23": "He asked her, “What’s the point of visiting him today? It’s not a New Moon, and it isn’t the Sabbath!”\nBut she kept saying, “Things will go well.”",
      "24": "So she saddled a donkey and told her servant, “Forward, driver! Don’t slow down on my account, unless I tell you!”",
      "25": "So out she went and eventually she arrived at Mount Carmel to visit the man of God.\nWhen the man of God noticed her from a distance, he told his attendant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the woman from Shunem!",
      "26": "Please run out quickly and greet her. Ask her, ‘Are things going well with you? Are things going well with your husband? Are things going well with your child?’”\nShe answered Gehazi, “Things are going well.”",
      "27": "As she came near the man of God on the mountain, she grabbed his feet. When Gehazi intervened to push her away, the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is deeply troubled! The Lord has concealed the thing from me, and hasn’t informed me.”",
      "28": "Then she asked, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Didn’t I beg you, ‘Don’t mislead me?’”",
      "29": "At this he told Gehazi, “Get ready to run! Take my staff in your hand, and get on the road. Don’t greet anyone you meet. If anyone greets you, don’t respond. Just go lay my staff on the youngster’s face.”",
      "30": "At this, the youngster’s mother replied, “As long as you and the Lord live, I’m not leaving you!” So he got up and followed her.",
      "31": "Meanwhile, Gehazi went on ahead of them and placed the staff on the youngster’s face, but when there was no sound or reaction, he returned, met Elisha, and told him, “The youngster has shown no sign of awakening.”",
      "32": "When Elisha entered the house, there was the youngster, dead and laid out on Elisha’s bed!",
      "33": "So he entered, shut the door behind them both, and prayed to the Lord.",
      "34": "Then he approached the child and lay down with his mouth near the child’s, with his eyes near those of the child, and taking the child’s hands in his. As Elisha stretched himself on the child, the child’s flesh began to grow warm.",
      "35": "Then he went downstairs, walked around back and forth inside the house once, went back up to his upper chamber, and stretched himself over the child again. The young man sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes.",
      "36": "He called out to Gehazi, “Go get the Shunammite woman!” So he called her. When she came in to see Elisha, he told her, “Take back your son!”",
      "37": "Then she approached him, fell at his feet, bowing low to the ground, took back her son, and went out.",
      "38": "Elisha returned to Gilgal during a time of famine in the land. While the Guild of Prophets were having a meal with him, he instructed his attendant, “Put a large pot on the fire and boil some stew for the Guild of Prophets.”",
      "39": "Somebody went out into the fields to grab some herbs, found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds, which he came and sliced up into the stew pot, but nobody else knew.",
      "40": "When they served the men, they began to eat the stew. But they cried out, “That pot of stew is deadly, you man of God!” So they couldn’t eat the stew.",
      "41": "But he replied, “Bring me some flour.” He tossed it into the pot and said, “Serve the people so they can eat.” Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.",
      "42": "Later on, a man arrived from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God some bread as a first fruit offering. He had 20 loaves of barley and ripe ears of corn in his sack. So Elisha said, “Give them to the people so they can eat.”",
      "43": "Elisha’s attendant asked, “What? Will this serve 100 men?”\nBut he replied, “Distribute it to the people so they can eat, because this is what the Lord says: ‘They will eat and have a surplus!’”",
      "44": "So he served them, and they ate and had some left over, just as the Lord had indicated."

      "1": "Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in the opinion of his master. He was highly favored, because by him the Lord had given victory to Aram. Though he was a mighty and valiant man, he was suffering from leprosy.",
      "2": "On one of their raids to the territory of Israel, Aram had taken captive a young girl when she was an infant, who had eventually become an attendant to Naaman’s wife.",
      "3": "She mentioned to her mistress, “If only my master were to visit the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”",
      "4": "Later, Naaman went to inform his master and told him something like this: “Thus and so spoke the young woman from the territory of Israel.”",
      "5": "The king of Aram replied, “Go now, and I’ll send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he left and took with him ten talents of silver and 6,000 units of gold, along with ten sets of clothing.",
      "6": "He also brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read as follows: “…and now as this letter finds its way to you, look! I’ve sent my servant Naaman to you so you may heal him of his leprosy.”",
      "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his clothes and cried out, “Am I God? Can I kill and give life? Is this man sending me a request to heal a man’s leprosy? Let’s think about this—he’s looking for a reason to start a fight with me!”",
      "8": "When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king and asked, “Why did you tear your clothes? Please, let the man come visit me and he will learn that there is a prophet in Israel!”",
      "9": "So Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots and stood in front of the door to Elisha’s house.",
      "10": "Elisha sent a messenger out to him, who told him, “Go bathe in the Jordan River seven times. Your flesh will be restored for you. Now stay clean!”",
      "11": "But Naaman flew into a rage and left, telling himself, “Look! I thought ‘He’s surely going to come out to me, stand still, call out in the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the infection, and cure the leprosy!’",
      "12": "Aren’t the Abana and Pharpar rivers in Damascus better than all of the water in Israel? Couldn’t I just bathe in them and become clean?” So he turned away and left, filled with anger.",
      "13": "But then his servants approached him and spoke with him. They said, “My father, had the prophet only asked of you something great, you would have done it, wouldn’t you? Yet he told you, ‘Bathe, and be clean…!’”",
      "14": "So he went down and plunged himself into the Jordan River seven times, just as the man of God had said, and his flesh rejuvenated like the flesh of a newborn child. And he was clean.",
      "15": "Naaman went back to the man of God, along with his entire entourage, and stood before him. “Please look!” he said. “I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel! So please, take a present from your servant.”",
      "16": "But Elisha replied, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not receive anything from you.” Though Naaman urged him to take it, Elisha declined.",
      "17": "So Naaman asked, “No? Then please let your servant load two mules with dirt from Israel, because your servant will no longer offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other god but the Lord.",
      "18": "In this one area may the Lord pardon your servant: Whenever my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, he will lean on my hand while I bow down in the temple of Rimmon. So may the Lord pardon your servant in this one area.”",
      "19": "“Go in peace,” he said. So Naaman left.\nAfter Naaman had gone only a short distance,",
      "20": "Gehazi, the attendant to Elisha, the man of God, told himself, “Look how my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman! He declined to take from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I’m going to run after him and get something from him.”",
      "21": "So Gehazi ran after Naaman.\nWhen Naaman noticed someone running after him, he came down from his chariot, greeted him and asked, “Is everything all right?”",
      "22": "Gehazi said, “Everything’s all right. My master sent me to tell you, ‘Just now two men from the Guild of Prophets have arrived from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them each a talent of silver bullion and two sets of clothes.’”",
      "23": "But Naaman said, “Please accept my invitation to take two talents of silver.” He urged him, binding two talents of silver in two bags, along with two sets of clothes. He placed them in the care of two of his young men, and they went on ahead of Gehazi.",
      "24": "When he arrived at the stronghold, Gehazi took the bags from their custody and hid them away in the house. Then he sent the men away and they left.",
      "25": "Later he went to address his master. Elisha asked him, “Where did you go, Gehazi?”\n“Your servant went nowhere in particular,” he said.",
      "26": "But Elisha responded, “Didn’t my heart break as the man was turning from his chariot to greet you? Is now the time to receive money? To receive clothes? And olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, servants, or female attendants?",
      "27": "Naaman’s leprosy will plague you and your descendants forever!” As he left Elisha’s presence, he was infected with leprosy that looked like white snow."

      "3": "Someone asked, “Would you be willing to come with your servants?”\n“I’m willing,” he replied.",
      "4": "So he accompanied them, and when they came to the Jordan River, they cut down some trees.",
      "5": "It happened that as one of them was felling a beam, his axe head fell into the water. He cried out, “Oh no! Master! The axe was on loan to me!”",

      "8": "Eventually the king of Aram went to war against Israel, taking counsel with his advisors and concluding, “In such and such a place I’ll build my encampment.”",

      "11": "The king of Aram flew into a rage over this, so he called in his advisors and asked them, “Will you please tell me which of us has joined the king of Israel?”",
      "12": "“No, your majesty,” one of his servants said. “Elisha the prophet, who lives in Israel, tells the king of Israel what you talk about in your bedroom!”",
      "13": "So the king ordered, “Go and discover where he is, so I may send men to take him into custody.”\nLater somebody told him, “Look! He’s in Dothan!”",
      "14": "So the king of Aram sent out horses, chariots, and an elite force, and they arrived during the night and surrounded the city.",
      "15": "Meanwhile, the attendant to the man of God got up early in the morning and went outside, and there were the elite forces, surrounding the city, accompanied by horses and chariots! So Elisha’s attendant cried out to him, “Oh no! Master! What will we do!?”",
      "16": "Elisha replied, “Stop being afraid, because there are more with us than with them!”",
      "17": "Then Elisha prayed, asking the Lord, “Please make him able to really see!” And so when the Lord enabled the young man to see, he looked, and there was the mountain, filled with horses and fiery chariots surrounding Elisha!",
      "18": "When the army approached him, Elisha spoke to the Lord, asking him, “Lord, I’m asking you please to afflict this group of people with blindness!” So he afflicted them with blindness, just as Elisha had asked.",
      "19": "Then Elisha told the army, “This isn’t the way, and this isn’t the city! Follow me, and I’ll bring you to the man you’re seeking.” Then he led them to Samaria.",
      "20": "When they arrived in Samaria, Elisha asked the Lord, “Enable them to see again.” So the Lord did so, and there they were—right in the middle of Samaria!",
      "21": "When the king of Israel saw Elisha, he asked him, “Shall I execute them, my father?”",
      "22": "But he replied, “No! You’re not to kill them! Would you execute those whom you’ve taken captive at the point of a sword or with your bow? Give them food and water so they can eat and drink. Then send them back to their master!”",
      "23": "So he prepared a large festival for them, and when they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them back to their master, and marauding gangs of Arameans never came into the territory of Israel again.",
      "24": "Some time later, King Ben-hadad from Aram mustered his army, invaded the land, and attacked Samaria",
      "25": "until there was a great famine throughout Samaria. The siege lasted until a donkey’s head cost 80 silver coins and one quarter of a unit of dove’s dung cost five silver coins.",
      "26": "While the king of Israel was walking along the city wall, a woman cried out to him. “Help me, your majesty!” she said.",
      "27": "He replied, “No! Since the Lord won’t give you victory, how will I be able to deliver you? From the threshing floor? From the wine press?”",
      "28": "Then the king asked her, “What’s bothering you?”\nShe said, “This woman told me, ‘Give up your son, and we’ll eat him today, and we’ll eat my son tomorrow.’”",
      "29": "So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day, I told her, ‘Give me your son so we can eat him!’ But she has hidden her son!”",
      "30": "When the king heard what the woman said, he ripped his garments as he continued walking along the city wall. As the people watched, all of a sudden they noticed he was wearing sackcloth underneath his clothes, inside next to his flesh!",
      "31": "He said, “May God do to me—and more also!—if the head of Shaphat’s son Elisha remains on his shoulders today!”",
      "32": "Meanwhile, Elisha was sitting in his house, along with the elders, when the king sent a man to kill him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha told the elders, “Are you watching how this descendant of murderers has ordered my head be cut off? Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and hold it to shut them out! Don’t you hear the sound of his master’s feet right behind him?”",
      "33": "While he was still talking with them, the messenger arrived to see him and delivered the king’s message to Elisha, “Look! This evil has come from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord anymore?”"

      "2": "But the royal attendant on whom the king depended responded to the man of God: “Look here! Even if the Lord were to open a window in the sky, how could this happen?”\nHe replied, “No, you look! You’ll see it with your eyes, but you won’t eat any of it!”",
      "3": "Now there happened to be four lepers who were at that very moment at the entrance to the city gate. As they were talking with one another, they said, “Why are we sitting here waiting to die?",
      "4": "If we tell ourselves, ‘Let’s remain in the city,’ we’ll die there since there’s famine in the city. But if we sit here, we’ll die, too. So let’s go over to the Arameans! If they spare our lives, we’ll live, and if they kill us…we’re dying anyway!”",
      "5": "So they got up at dusk and went out to the Aramean encampment. But when they arrived at the outskirts of the Aramean encampment, there was no one there!",
      "6": "The Lord had made the Aramean army hear the sounds of chariots, horses, and a large army, so they told one another, “Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the Egyptians to come attack us!”",
      "7": "So the Arameans got up and ran away in the gathering darkness. They left behind their tents, horses, and donkeys just as they were—and fled for their lives!",
      "8": "When the lepers arrived at the outskirts of the encampment, they entered one tent and ate and drank. Then they carried off from there some silver, gold, and clothes, and went out and hid them. After this, they returned, entered another tent, raided it, and went and hid all of that, too!",
      "9": "But then they told each other, “We’re not doing the right thing. This is a day of good news, but if we keep quiet until morning, we’re sure to be punished! So let’s leave and go tell the king’s household!”",
      "10": "So they left, called out to the city gatekeepers, and reported to them: “We went out to the Aramean encampment, and there was nobody there! Not even the sound of men—only horses and donkeys tied up, and tents left just as they were!”",
      "11": "The gatekeepers announced the report to the king’s attendants,",
      "12": "so the king got up in the middle of the night and ordered his servants: “Let me explain what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we’re hungry, so they’ve left their encampment to conceal themselves in the surrounding fields. They’re telling themselves, ‘When they come out of the city, we’ll capture them alive and enter the city!’”",
      "13": "One of his attendants suggested, “Please, let’s take five of the remaining horses, since those who remain here will end up like the rest of Israel, which has already died, and we’ll send them out to look.”",
      "14": "So they took two chariots and horses, and the king sent them out after the Aramean army with the orders, “Go and look!”",
      "15": "They went out in the direction of the Jordan River, and the entire roadway was strewn with clothes and equipment that the Arameans had abandoned in their haste to leave! So the messengers returned and reported to the king.",
      "16": "At this, the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. At that time, a seah of finely ground flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in accordance with the Lord’s message.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, the king appointed the same royal attendant on whom he depended to take control of the city gate, but the people trampled him to death in the gate, just as the man of God had told the king when the king came down to him.",

      "19": "But the royal attendant on whom the king depended responded to the man of God: “Look here! Even if the Lord were to make a window in the sky, how could this happen?”\nHe replied, “No, you look! You’ll see it with your eyes, but you won’t eat any of it!”",
