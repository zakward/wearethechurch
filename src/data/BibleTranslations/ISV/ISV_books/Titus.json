      "14": "and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.",

      "14": "He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about doing good deeds.",
      "15": "These are the things you should teach. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you."

    "3": {
      "1": "Remind believers to submit to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work.",
      "2": "They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and perfectly courteous to everyone.",
      "3": "After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another.",
      "4": "In grace our Savior God appeared,\n    to make his love for mankind clear.",
      "5": "‘Twas not for deeds that we had done,\n    but by his steadfast love alone,\nhe saved us through a second birth,\n    renewed us by the Spirit’s work,",

      "9": "But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the Law. These things are useless and worthless.",
      "10": "Have nothing to do with a divisive person after you have warned him once or twice.",
      "11": "For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.",
      "12": "As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.",
      "13": "Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the Law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.",
      "14": "Our own people should also learn to make good deeds a priority when urgent needs arise, so they won’t be unproductive.",
      "15": "All who are with me send you greetings. Greet our fellow believers who love us. May grace be with all of you! Amen."
