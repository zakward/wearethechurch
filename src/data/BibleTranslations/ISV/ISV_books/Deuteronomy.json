      "2": "It takes eleven days to travel from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea via Mount Seir.",
      "3": "On the first day of the eleventh month, in the fortieth year, Moses spoke to the Israelis about everything that the Lord had commanded him concerning them.",
      "4": "This took place after he defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and Og, king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth at Edrei.",
      "5": "East of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to expound this Law:",
      "6": "“The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb. He said, ‘You have been at this mountain long enough.",
      "7": "Break camp, get going, and proceed to the hill country of the Amorites and all the nearby places in the Arabah desert, the highlands, the foothills, the Negev, the coastal plains, all of the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates.",
      "8": "Look! I’ve given you the land that lies ahead. Go in and possess the land that I, the Lord, promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as to their descendants.’”",
      "9": "“I also told you at that time that I won’t be able to sustain you on my own.",
      "10": "The Lord your God greatly multiplied your numbers, and today you are like the stars in the sky.",
      "11": "May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase your numbers a thousand times more, and may he bless you, as he promised you.",
      "12": "How can I bear the burden of you and your bickering all by myself?",
      "13": "Choose for yourselves wise and discerning men, known to your tribes, and appoint them as your leaders.",
      "14": "You answered by saying that this plan is a good thing.",
      "15": "So I chose leaders from your tribes, wise and respected men, and I appointed them over you—commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.",
      "16": "I charged your judges at that time, ‘When you hold a hearing between brothers, judge fairly between a man and his brother or between foreigners.",
      "17": "When you hold a hearing, don’t be partial in judgment toward the least important or toward the great. Never fear men, because judgment belongs to God. If the matter is difficult for you, bring it to me for a hearing.’",
      "18": "I charged you at that time that you must do all of these things.”",
      "19": "“Then we set out from Horeb and walked through that vast and dreadful desert, where you observed the road to the Amorite hill country. Just as the Lord our God ordained for us, we finally arrived at Kadesh-barnea.",
      "20": "I told you at that time, ‘You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is about to give us.",
      "21": "Look! The Lord your God has given the land that lies before you. Go and possess it, just as the Lord God of your ancestors commanded you. Don’t be afraid or discouraged.’",
      "22": "“Then all of you approached me and said: ‘Let’s send out men in advance of us so they can survey the land and bring back a report to us on how we’ll go up to their cities.’",
      "23": "Because this suggestion seemed good to me, I chose twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.",
      "24": "Then these men set out, went up to the hill county, reached the Eshcol Valley, and surveyed it.",
      "25": "They hand-picked some of the fruit of the land, brought it down to us, and gave a report that said, ‘The land which the Lord is about to give us is good.’”",

      "28": "Where can we go? Our brothers discouraged us when they said that the people are bigger and taller than we are. Their cities are tall and fortified to the sky, and we also saw the Anakim there.’",

      "37": "“The Lord was also furious with me because of you. He said: ‘You will not enter the land.",
      "38": "However, Nun’s son Joshua, your assistant, will go there. Encourage him, for he will cause Israel to take possession of it.",
      "39": "Your little ones—whom you said would be taken captive—and your children who do not yet know right from wrong will enter the land. I will give it to them and they themselves will possess it.",
      "40": "But as for you, prepare to set out for the desert on the way to the Reed Sea.’",
      "41": "“You responded to me and said, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will now go up and fight according to what the Lord our God commanded.’ So each man put on his weapon for battle and recklessly started out for the hill country.”",
      "42": "“Then the Lord told me: ‘Tell them not to go up and fight because I will not be in their midst, or else you will be defeated before your enemies.’",
      "43": "“I spoke to you but you didn’t listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the Lord and went up to the hill country.",
      "44": "The Amorites who lived in the hill country came out to engage you in battle. They pursued you like bees do and crushed you from Seir to Hormah.",
      "45": "You returned and cried out in the Lord’s presence, but the Lord didn’t hear your voice or listen to you.",

      "3": "‘You’ve walked around this mountain long enough. Turn northward",
      "4": "and command this people, “You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau who live around Seir. They will be afraid of you so be very careful.",
      "5": "Don’t fight them, because I won’t give you any part of their land, not even the size of a footprint. I have given Mount Seir to Esau as their property.",
      "6": "You may buy food to eat and water to drink from them, paying with cash.”’",
      "7": "Indeed, the Lord your God blessed all the works of your hands. He knows about your travels through this vast desert. The Lord your God was with you these past 40 years, so that you didn’t lack anything.",
      "8": "So we bypassed our relatives, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. We turned through the Arabah desert from Elath, and from Ezion-geber we traveled the desert road to Moab.”",
      "9": "“Then the Lord told me, ‘Don’t harass Moab or provoke them to war, because I won’t give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their property.",

      "12": "The Horites used to live in Seir before the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, exterminated them, and settled there instead, just as Israel will do in the land of its possession, which the Lord gave them.)",
      "13": "Now get going and cross the Wadi Zered.’ And so we crossed the Wadi Zered.",
      "14": "Now from the time we left Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was 38 years. All of that generation, the soldiers in the camp, were destroyed just as the Lord swore they would be.",

      "16": "“And so all the soldiers among the people died.",

      "19": "When you come to the Ammonites, don’t harass or provoke them to war, for I won’t give any part of Ammonite land to you, since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their property.",
      "20": "“‘(Indeed, it was considered Rephaim territory, since the Rephaim used to lived there. The Ammonites called them Zamzummites,",
      "21": "a great people, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed the Rephaim, so that the Ammonites dispossessed them and settled there instead.",
      "22": "This is what he did for the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them. So they dispossessed them and settled there in their place, where they live to this day.",
      "23": "It was the same for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza. The Caphtorites, who came from Crete, destroyed them and settled there in their place.)",
      "24": "Get ready and set out for the Wadi Arnon. Look! I’ve given into your control Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, along with his land. Prepare to take possession by provoking him to war.",
      "25": "Starting today I will begin to instill fear and terror of you on the part of every nation under heaven who hears reports about you. They’ll tremble in anguish before you.’”",
      "26": "“I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with this message of peace:",
      "27": "‘Let me pass through your territory. I’ll stay on the main road. I won’t turn to the right or left.",
      "28": "Sell me food for cash, so I can eat and give me water for cash, so I can drink. Just let me pass through on foot,",
      "29": "as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for me, as did the Moabites who live in Ar. I’ll pass through, until I will have crossed the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is about to give us.’",
      "30": "But King Sihon of Heshbon did not allow us to pass through, because the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made him arrogant, in order to deliver him into your control today.",
      "31": "“Then the Lord told me, ‘See, I’ve begun to deliver Sihon and his territory over to you. Prepare to take possession of his land.’",
      "32": "“Sihon came out to meet us, including his entire army, at the battle of Jahaz.",
      "33": "The Lord our God delivered him to us, so we attacked him, his son, and his whole army.",
      "34": "We captured all his towns at that time. We utterly destroyed every town—the men, the women, and the children—leaving no survivors.",

      "3": "“So the Lord our God also delivered into our control King Og of Bashan, along with his whole army. We attacked him until there were no survivors.",
      "4": "Then we captured all his cities at that time. There was not a city left that we didn’t capture from them—60 cities in all from the region of Argob, which is part of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",
      "5": "All of these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars. Furthermore, there were very many unwalled regions.",
      "6": "We utterly destroyed them, just as we did King Sihon of Heshbon, attacking them in every city—the men, women, and children.",
      "7": "But we kept for ourselves all of the livestock and plunder from the towns.",

      "11": "Only King Og of Bashan remained from the remnants of the Rephaim. In fact, his bed was made of iron. It’s in Rabbah of the Ammonites, isn’t it? It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide.”",

      "14": "Manasseh’s son Jair captured all the Argob region as far as the territory of the descendants of Geshur and the descendants of Maacath. Bashan was named after him; that’s why it is called Havvoth-jair to this day.",
