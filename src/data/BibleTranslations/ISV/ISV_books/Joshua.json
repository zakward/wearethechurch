    "1": {
      "1": "After Moses, the servant of the Lord, had died, the Lord spoke to Nun’s son Joshua, announcing to him,",
      "2": "“My servant Moses is dead. Now get ready to cross the Jordan River—you and all the people—to the land that I’m giving the Israelis.",
      "3": "I’m giving you every place where the sole of your foot falls, just as I promised Moses.",
      "4": "Your territorial border will extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon Mountains, to the river—that great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—as far as the Mediterranean Sea where the sun sets.",
      "5": "No one will be victorious against you for the rest of your life. I’ll be with you just like I was with Moses—I’ll neither fail you nor abandon you.",
      "6": "“Be strong and courageous, because you’ll be leading this people to inherit the land that I promised to give their ancestors.",
      "7": "Only be strong and very courageous to ensure that you obey all the instructions that my servant Moses gave you—turn neither to the right nor to the left from it—so that you may succeed wherever you go.",
      "8": "This set of instructions is not to cease being a part of your conversations. Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to carry out everything that’s written in it, for then you’ll prosper and succeed.",
      "9": "I’ve commanded you, haven’t I? Be strong and courageous. Don’t be fearful or discouraged, because the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”",
      "10": "Then Joshua gave orders to the officials of the people.",
      "11": "“Go through the camp,” he said, “and command the people, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, because within three days you’ll be crossing the Jordan River to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you—so go get it!’”",
      "12": "Joshua told the descendants of Reuben, the descendants of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,",
      "13": "“Remember what Moses commanded you when he said, ‘The Lord your God will provide you rest, as well as this land.’",
      "14": "Your wives, your young children, and your livestock will remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan River, but you and all your warriors will cross, ready for battle, in full view of your relatives, and you will help them",
      "15": "until the Lord gives relief to your relatives, as he did to you. Then they’ll take the land that the Lord your God is giving them as their inheritance. You’ll return to the land of your heritage and receive the inheritance that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the east side of the Jordan River, in the direction of the sunrise.”",
      "16": "“We’ll do everything that you commanded,” they replied. “We’ll go wherever you send us.",
      "17": "We’ll listen and obey you in everything, just like we did with Moses. Only may the Lord your God be with you, just as he was with Moses.",
      "18": "Anyone who rebels against what you say and doesn’t listen to your words regarding everything that you command will be executed. Only be strong and courageous.”"

      "1": "After this, Nun’s son Joshua sent two men from the Acacia groves as undercover scouts. He told them, “Go and look over the land. Pay special attention to Jericho.” So they went out, came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, and lodged there.",
      "2": "Then the king of Jericho was told, “Look! Israeli men arrived tonight to scout out the land.”",
      "3": "So the king of Jericho sent for Rahab and ordered her, “Bring out the men who came to visit you and lodged in your house, because they’ve come to scout out the entire land.”",
      "4": "Now the woman had taken the two men and hid them. So she replied, “The men really did come to me, but I didn’t know from where they came.",
      "5": "At dusk, when it was time to close the city gates, the men left. I don’t know where the men went. Go after them quickly, and you might overtake them.”",
      "6": "But she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them among stalks of flax that she had laid out in order on the roof.",
      "7": "So the men pursued them along the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as the search party had left, they shut the city gate after them.",
      "8": "Before the scouts had lain down, she went up to them on the roof",
      "9": "“I’m really convinced that the Lord has given you the land,” she said, “because we’re overwhelmed with fear of you. All the other inhabitants of the land are demoralized at your presence,",
      "10": "because we heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Reed Sea right in front of you as you were coming out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan River—to Sihon and Og—whom you completely destroyed.",
      "11": "When we heard these reports, we all became terrified and discouraged because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath.",
      "12": "Now therefore, since I’ve treated you so kindly, please swear in the name of the Lord that you’ll also be kind to my father’s household by giving me this sure sign:",
      "13": "Spare my father, my mother, and my brothers and sisters, along with everyone who belongs with them so we won’t be killed.”",
      "14": "So the men told her, “Our life for yours—even to death—if you don’t betray this mission of ours. Then when the Lord gives us this land, we’ll treat you graciously and faithfully.”",
      "15": "So she let them down by a rope through the window, since her house was built into the town wall where she lived.",
      "16": "She told them, “Go out to the hill country, so the search party won’t find you, and hide for three days. After that, you may go on your own way.”",
      "17": "The men replied, “We’ll be free from our commitment to you to which you’ve obligated us",
      "18": "when we invade the land, if you don’t tie this rope made with red cords in the window through which you let us down, and if you don’t gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all of the rest of your father’s household into your house.",
      "19": "Everyone who leaves through the doors of your house into the street will be responsible for his own death, but we’ll be responsible for anyone who remains with you in the house if even so much as a hand is laid on him.",
      "20": "But if you report this incident, we’ll be free from the oath to which you’ve made us swear.”",
      "21": "“Since you put it that way,” she replied, “I agree.” After she sent them on their way and they had left, she tied the red cord in the window.",
      "22": "The scouts left for the hill country and remained there for three days until the search party returned. The search party searched the entire road, but was unable to find them.",
      "23": "Later, the two men returned from the hill country, crossed over the Jordan River, approached Nun’s son Joshua, and told him everything that had happened to them.",
      "24": "They reported to Joshua, “The Lord really has given the entire land into our control. The inhabitants of the land have melted away right in front of us!”"

    "3": {
      "1": "Joshua got up early the next morning. Accompanied by all the Israelis, he set out from the Acacia groves and arrived at the Jordan River, where they encamped before crossing it.",
      "2": "Three days later, the officers went throughout the camp,",
      "3": "giving orders to the people. They said, “When you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then get up, leave where you are, and follow it.",
      "4": "Be sure to keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits between you and it. Don’t come near it, so you can be certain where you’re going, since you haven’t passed this way before.”",
      "5": "Then Joshua addressed the people: “Consecrate yourselves, because tomorrow the Lord will do marvelous things among you.”",
      "6": "After this, Joshua instructed the priests, “Take up the Ark of the Covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went on ahead of the people.",
      "7": "At this point, the Lord told Joshua, “Today I’m going to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they’ll be sure that I’m going to be with you just as I was with Moses.",
      "8": "Give this command to the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Covenant: ‘When you arrive at the water of the Jordan River, stand still in the Jordan.’”",
      "9": "So Joshua told the Israelis, “Come here and listen to what the Lord your God has to say.”",
      "10": "Joshua continued, “This is how you’ll know that the living God really is among you: he’s going to remove the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites right in front of you.",
      "11": "Look! The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of whole the earth is crossing ahead of you into the Jordan River.",
      "12": "So take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.",
      "13": "When the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of the whole earth, touch the water in the Jordan River, the water that feeds the Jordan will be cut off from above and they’ll stand still in a single location.”",
      "14": "So the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan River, with the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant in full view of the people.",
      "15": "When the priests who carried the ark entered the Jordan River, as their feet touched the water’s edge (The Jordan River overflows all of its banks daily during the harvest season.),",
      "16": "the water flowing downstream from above stood still in a single location, a great distance away at Adam, a city near Zarethan. The water that flowed south toward the sea in the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.",
      "17": "The priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River, while all Israel crossed on dry ground until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan River."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "As soon as the entire nation had completed its crossing of the Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said,",
      "2": "“Gather together twelve men from the people—one man from each tribe—",
      "3": "and tell them, ‘Pick up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests’ feet were standing, bring them along with you, and put them down where you camp tonight.’”",
      "4": "So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the people of Israel, one man from each tribe.",
      "5": "Joshua told them, “Cross over again in front of the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan River. Then each of you pick up a stone on his shoulder with which to build a memorial, one for each of the tribes of Israel.",
      "6": "Let this serve as a sign among you, so that when your children ask in times to come, ‘What do these stones mean to you,’",
      "7": "then you’ll say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan River were cut off in front of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan River, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ So these stones will become a memorial to the Israelis forever.”",
      "8": "The Israelis did just as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River—just as the Lord had spoken to Joshua—according to the number of the tribes of the Israelis, and they carried them over to where they would be pitching camp, and they put them down there.",
      "9": "Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River at the location where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant had been standing, and they remain there to this day.",
      "10": "The priests who were carrying the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan River until everything had been done in accordance with what the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people and with everything that Moses had commanded Joshua. So the people hurried and crossed over.",
      "11": "When all of the people had completed their crossing, the ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in full view of the people.",
      "12": "Just as Moses had directed, the descendants of Reuben, the descendants of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, dressed in battle regalia, in full view of the other Israelis.",
      "13": "About 40,000 soldiers equipped to do battle in the Lord’s presence crossed over to the desert plains of Jericho.",
      "14": "That day, the Lord exalted Joshua in the presence of all Israel so that they revered him just as they had revered Moses throughout his life.",
      "15": "Now the Lord had told Joshua,",
      "16": "“Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan River.”",
      "17": "So Joshua ordered the priests, “Come up from the Jordan River.”",
      "18": "As soon as the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord had come up from the middle of the Jordan River, and the soles of the priests’ feet came up to dry ground, the water of the Jordan River returned to normal, covering its banks as it had done so before.",
      "19": "The people came up from the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern outskirts of Jericho.",
      "20": "Joshua set up the twelve stones that they had removed from the Jordan River at Gilgal.",
      "21": "Then he told the Israelis, “When your descendants ask their parents in years to come, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’",
      "22": "you are to tell your descendants: ‘Israel crossed this Jordan River on dry ground",
      "23": "because the Lord your God dried up the water of the Jordan River right in front of you, until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God had done to the Reed Sea—which he had dried up in front of us until we had crossed it also.’",
      "24": "Do this so that all of the people of the earth may know how strong the power of the Lord is, and so that you may fear the Lord your God every day.”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "All the Amorite kings who lived across the Jordan River to the west and all the Canaanite kings by the Mediterranean Sea became discouraged as soon as they heard that the Lord had dried up the water of the Jordan River for the people of Israel until they had crossed it. They no longer had a will to fight because of the people of Israel.",
      "2": "At that time the Lord told Joshua, “Make for yourselves some flint knives and circumcise the Israelis who haven’t been circumcised yet.”",
      "3": "So Joshua made some flint knives and circumcised the Israelis at Gibeath-haaraloth.",
      "4": "Joshua circumcised them because all of the males among the people who came out of Egypt—that is, all the warriors—had died during their journey through the wilderness following their departure from Egypt.",
      "5": "Although everyone who had left Egypt had been circumcised, nevertheless all the people born during the journey after their departure from Egypt had not been circumcised.",
      "6": "The Israelis traveled 40 years in the wilderness until the entire nation—that is, the warriors who had departed from Egypt—had perished because they hadn’t listened to the voice of the Lord. The Lord had promised them that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.",
      "7": "As a result, it was their descendants, whom he raised up to take their place, that Joshua circumcised. They had remained uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised during their journey.",
      "8": "When the circumcision of the entire nation was complete, they remained in their places within the camp until they were healed.",
      "9": "Then the Lord told Joshua, “Today I have rolled the disgrace of Egypt away from you.” That’s why that place is called “Gilgal” to this day.",
      "10": "While the Israelis remained encamped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they observed the Passover during the evening of the fourteenth day of the month.",
      "11": "On the day following Passover—on that exact day—they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.",
      "12": "The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land. Since the Israelis no longer received manna, they ate crops from the land of Canaan that year.",
      "13": "Now it happened that while Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and much to his amazement, he saw a man standing in front of him, holding a drawn sword in his hand! Joshua approached him and asked him, “Are you one of us, or are you with our enemies?”",
      "14": "“Neither,” he answered. “I have come as commander of the Lord’s Army.”\nJoshua immediately fell on his face to the earth and worshipped, saying to him, “Lord, what do you have for your servant by way of command?”",
      "15": "The commander of the Lord’s Army replied to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you’re standing is holy.” So Joshua did so."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Meanwhile, Jericho was fortified inside and out because of the Israelis. Nobody could leave or enter.",
      "2": "The Lord told Joshua, “Look! I have given Jericho over to your control, along with its kings and valiant soldiers.",
      "3": "March around the city, all the soldiers circling the city once. Do this for six days,",
      "4": "with seven priests carrying in front of the ark seven trumpets made from rams’ horns. On the seventh day march around the city seven times while the priests blow their trumpets.",
      "5": "When they sound a long blast with the ram’s horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then the entire army is to cry out loud, the city wall will collapse, and then all of the soldiers are to charge straight ahead.”",
      "6": "So Nun’s son Joshua called for the priests. “Pick up the Ark of the Covenant,” he told them, “and have seven priests carry seven trumpets made from rams’ horns in front of the ark of the Lord.”",
      "7": "He told the army, “Go out and encircle the city. Have the armed men march out in front of the ark of the Lord.”",
      "8": "And so, just as Joshua had commanded, seven of the priests went forward, carrying the seven trumpets made of rams’ horns in the Lord’s presence, blowing the trumpets while the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them.",
      "9": "Armed men preceded the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and a rear guard followed the ark, while the trumpets continued to blow.",
      "10": "Joshua issued orders to the army: “You are not to shout or even let your voice be heard. Don’t utter a word until I tell you to shout. Then shout!”",
      "11": "So the ark of the Lord was taken once around the city, then they went back to camp and spent the night there.",
      "12": "Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests picked up the ark of the Lord.",
      "13": "The seven priests who carried the seven trumpets made from rams’ horns preceded the ark of the Lord, blowing their trumpets constantly. The armed men preceded them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets continued to blow.",
      "14": "On the second day they marched around the city once and then went back to camp. They did this for six days.",
      "15": "They rose early at dawn on the seventh day and marched around the city seven times, just as they had before, except that on that day only they marched around the city seven times.",
      "16": "As they completed the seventh time, after the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua told the army, “Shout, because the Lord has given you the city!",
      "17": "The city—along with everything in it—is to be turned over to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone who is with her in her house may live, because she hid the scouts we sent.",
      "18": "Now as for you, everything has been turned over for destruction. Don’t covet or take any of these things. Otherwise, you’ll make the camp of Israel itself an object worthy of destruction, and bring trouble on it.",
      "19": "But everything made of silver and gold, and vessels made of bronze and iron are set apart to the Lord. They are to go into the treasury of the Lord.”",
      "20": "So the army shouted and the trumpets were blown again. As soon as the army heard the sound of the trumpets, they shouted loudly and the wall collapsed. The army charged straight ahead into the city and captured it.",
      "21": "They turned over everyone in the city for destruction and executed them, including both men and women, young and old, and oxen, sheep, and donkeys.",
      "22": "Joshua told the two men who had scouted the land, “Go into the prostitute’s home and bring her out of it, along with everyone who is with her, just as you promised her.”",
      "23": "So the young men who had been scouts went in and brought Rahab out, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and everyone else who was with her. They brought her entire family out and set them outside the camp of Israel.",
      "24": "Then the army set fire to the city and to everything in it, except that they reserved the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron for the treasury of the Lord.",
      "25": "But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, along with her family and everyone who was with her. Her family has lived in Israel ever since, because she hid the scouts whom Joshua sent to observe Jericho.",
      "26": "Then Joshua made everyone take the following oath at that time. He said:\n“Cursed in the presence of the Lord is the man\n    who restores and rebuilds this city of Jericho!\nHe will lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn,\n    and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”",
      "27": "So the Lord was with Joshua, and as a result, Joshua’s reputation spread throughout the land."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Later, the Israelis broke their promise regarding the things that had been turned over to destruction. Carmi’s son Achan, grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah from the tribe of Judah, appropriated some of the things that had been turned over to destruction. As a result, the Lord became angry with the Israelis.",
      "2": "Meanwhile, Joshua had sent some soldiers from Jericho to Ai, which was near Beth-aven, east of Bethel. He ordered them, “Go up and scout the land.” So the soldiers went up and scouted Ai and",
      "3": "returned to Joshua.\n“Not all of the people need to go up,” they reported. “Only about two or three thousand men should attack Ai. Since they are so few, don’t make all of the army work hard up there.”",
      "4": "So about three thousand went up there, but they ran away from the men of Ai.",
      "5": "The men of Ai killed about 36 of them, pursuing them outside the city gates as far as Shebarim, killing them as they descended. As a result, the army became terrified and lost their confidence.",
      "6": "At this, Joshua tore his clothes, fell down to the ground on his face before the ark of the Lord until evening—he and the leaders of Israel—and they covered their heads with dust.",
      "7": "“Lord God,” Joshua asked, “Why have you brought this people across the Jordan River? To hand us over to the Amorites so we’ll be destroyed? Wouldn’t it have been better for us to be content to settle on the other side of the Jordan?",
      "8": "Lord, what am I to say, now that Israel has run away from its enemies?",
      "9": "The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, will surround us, and eliminate us from the earth! Then what will you do about your great reputation?”",
      "10": "“Get up!” the Lord replied to Joshua. “Why have you fallen on your face?",
      "11": "Israel has sinned. They broke my covenant that I commanded them by taking some of the things that had been turned over to destruction. They have stolen, have been deceitful, and have stored what they stole among their own belongings.",
      "12": "The Israelis have been unable to stand before their enemies. They’re turning their backs and running from their enemies because they themselves have been turned over to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy these things that have been turned over to destruction.",
      "13": "So get up and sanctify the people. Tell them, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord God of Israel, says: “There are things turned over to destruction among you, Israel. You won’t be able to defeat your enemies until you remove what has been turned over to destruction.",
      "14": "Tomorrow morning you are to come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord selects is to come forward by tribes, the tribe that the Lord selects is to come forward by households, and the household that the Lord selects is to come forward one by one.",
      "15": "The one selected as having taken what has been turned over to destruction is to be incinerated, along with everything that pertains to him, because he has transgressed against the covenant of the Lord and committed an outrageous thing in Israel.”’”",
      "16": "So Joshua got up early that morning, brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.",
      "17": "He brought near the tribes of Judah, and the Zerahite tribe was selected. Then he brought near the Zerahite tribe family by family, and the household of Zabdi was selected.",
      "18": "Next, he brought near his household one by one, and Carmi’s son Achan, grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah, was selected from the tribe of Judah.",
      "19": "Joshua then spoke to Achan, “My son, give glory and praise to the Lord God of Israel. Tell me right now what you did. Don’t hide anything.”",
      "20": "Achan answered Joshua, “It’s true. I’m the one who sinned against the Lord God of Israel.",
      "21": "I noticed among the war spoils a beautiful mantle from Shinar, 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels. Because I wanted them, I took them, and they’re buried in the ground inside my tent. The silver is underneath.”",
      "22": "So Joshua sent some messengers, who ran to the tent. And there it was, hidden in the tent with the silver underneath.",
      "23": "They took the things from the tent that had been turned over to destruction, brought them to Joshua and all of the Israelis, and laid them out in the presence of the Lord.",
      "24": "Then Joshua, with all Israel accompanying him, took Zerah’s son Achan, along with the silver, the mantle, the gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that belonged to him to the Valley of Achor.",
      "25": "Joshua announced, “Why did you bring trouble to us? Today the Lord is bringing trouble to you!” So all Israel stoned him to death, incinerated them, and buried them with stones,",
      "26": "piling up a large mound of boulders that remains to this day. After this, the Lord turned his burning anger away, and that is why that place is called “the Valley of Achor” to this day."

      "1": "The Lord then told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid or lose heart! Take all the fighting men with you, and go up right now to Ai. Take note that I have handed over the king of Ai into your control, along with his people, his city, and his land.",
      "2": "Do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, but take its spoil and its livestock as war booty for yourselves. Set an ambush around the city.”",
      "3": "So Joshua and all of the fighting men prepared to go out against Ai. Joshua selected 30,000 valiant warriors and sent them out by night,",
      "4": "telling them, “Pay attention now! You are to set up an ambush around the city. Don’t go very far from the city, and all of you remain on alert.",
      "5": "I and all of the army with me will advance upon the city. When they come out after us like they did before, we’ll run away from them.",
      "6": "They’ll come after us until we’ve drawn them away from the city, because they’ll say, ‘They’re running away from us just like they did before.’ While we’re running away from them,",
      "7": "you get up from the ambush and seize the city, because the Lord your God will give it into your control.",
      "8": "When you’ve taken the city, set it on fire, just as the Lord ordered. Look! These are your orders!”",
      "9": "So Joshua sent them out, and they set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai.\nJoshua spent that night in the camp among the army.",
      "10": "In the morning, Joshua got up early, mustered his army, and set off for Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel in full view of the army.",
