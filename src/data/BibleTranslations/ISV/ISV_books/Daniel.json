      "1": "In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.",
      "2": "Within a week, the Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah over to him, along with valuable objects from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar brought them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar and stored them in its treasure house.",
      "3": "Later, the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to bring in some Israelis of royal and noble descent.",
      "4": "They were to be young men without physical defect, handsome in appearance, skilled in all wisdom, quick to learn, prudent in how they used knowledge, and capable of serving in the king’s palace. They were to learn the literature and language of the Chaldeans.",
      "5": "The king assigned them fine food and choice wine on a daily basis, ordering them to be trained for three years, at the end of which time they would enter the king’s service.",
      "6": "Included among the people of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",
      "7": "The chief officer assigned the name “Belteshazzar” to Daniel, the name “Shadrach” to Hananiah, the name “Meshach” to Mishael, and the name “Abednego” to Azariah.",
      "8": "Daniel determined within himself not to become defiled by the king’s menu of rich foods or by the king’s wine, so he requested permission from the chief officer not to defile himself.",
      "9": "God granted to Daniel grace and compassion on the part of the chief officer.",
      "10": "The chief officer told Daniel, “I fear his majesty the king, who has determined what you eat and drink. If he notices that your faces are more pale than the other young men in your group, I will forfeit my head to the king.”",
      "11": "But Daniel told the guard whom the chief officer had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
      "12": "“Please test your servants for ten days and let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
      "13": "Then compare how we look with the young men who ate the king’s rich food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you observe.”",
      "14": "So he listened to what Daniel said and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of ten days their appearance was better and their faces were well-nourished compared to the young men who ate the king’s rich food.",
      "16": "So the guard took away their rich food and wine, giving them vegetables.",
      "17": "As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge, aptitude for learning, and wisdom. Daniel also could understand all kinds of visions and dreams.",
      "18": "Then at the end of the training period that the king had established, the chief officer brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "When the king spoke to them, none of them compared to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah as they stood before the king.",
      "20": "In every matter of wisdom or understanding that the king discussed with them, he found them ten times superior to all the astrologers and enchanters in his entire palace.",
      "21": "So Daniel remained there in service until the first year of King Cyrus."

    "2": {
      "1": "During the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled him. As a result, he couldn’t sleep.",
      "2": "So the king gave orders to summon diviners, enchanters, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to reveal to the king what he had dreamed. When they came and stood before him,",
      "3": "the king told them, “I have dreamed a dream and I will remain troubled until I can understand it.”",
      "4": "The Chaldeans responded to the king in Aramaic: “May the king live forever. Tell the dream to your servants, and we’ll reveal its meaning.”",
      "5": "In reply the king told the Chaldeans, “Here is what I have commanded: If you don’t tell me both the dream and its meaning, you’ll be destroyed and your houses will be reduced to rubble.",
      "6": "But if you do relate the dream to me as well as its meaning, you’ll receive gifts, rewards, and great honor from me. Therefore reveal the dream to me, along with its meaning.”",
      "7": "They replied again, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we’ll disclose its meaning.”",
      "8": "The king responded, “I’m convinced that you’re stalling for time because you’re aware of what I’ve commanded.",
      "9": "So if you don’t disclose the dream to me, there will be only one sentence for all of you. You have conspired together to present lies and corrupt interpretations until the situation changes. Now tell me the dream and I’ll know that you can reveal its true meaning.”",
      "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king directly, “There’s not a single man on earth who can do what the king has commanded. No king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such a thing from any diviner, enchanter, or Chaldean.",
      "11": "Furthermore, what the king is asking is so difficult that no one can reveal it except the gods—and they don’t live with human beings.”",
      "12": "At this point, the king flew into a rage and issued an order to destroy all the advisors of Babylon.",
      "13": "When the order went out to kill the advisors, they searched for Daniel and his friends to kill them, too.",
      "14": "Daniel responded with wisdom and discretion to Arioch, the king’s executioner, who had gone out to execute the advisors of Babylon.",
      "15": "He asked him, “Why such a harsh decree from the king?” Then Arioch informed Daniel,",
      "16": "so Daniel went to ask Nebuchadnezzar for an appointment to see him, and it was granted him so that he could reveal the meaning to the king.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the king’s command.",
      "18": "Daniel was seeking mercy, in order to ask about this mystery in the presence of the God of heaven, so that Daniel and his friends might not be executed along with the rest of the advisors of Babylon.",
      "19": "When the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision later that night, Daniel blessed the God of heaven",
      "20": "and said,\n“May the name of God be blessed forever and ever;\n    wisdom and power are his for evermore.",
      "21": "It is God who alters the times and seasons,\n    and he removes kings and promotes kings.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\n    and knowledge to the discerning.",
      "22": "He reveals what is profoundly mysterious\n    and knows what is in the darkness;\n        with him dwells light.",
      "23": "To you, God of my ancestors, I give thanks and praise,\n    because you have given me wisdom and power;\nyou have now revealed to me what we asked of you\n    by making known to us what the king commanded.”",
      "24": "After this, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the advisors of Babylon. He told him, “Don’t destroy the advisors of Babylon. Bring me before the king and I’ll explain the meaning to him.”",
      "25": "Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and informed him: “I’ve found a man from the Judean captives who will make known the meaning to the king.”",
      "26": "King Nebuchadnezzar replied by saying to Daniel (whose Babylonian name is Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me about the dream and its meaning?”",
      "27": "By way of answer, Daniel addressed the king:\n“None of the advisors, enchanters, diviners, or astrologers can explain the secret that the king has requested to be made known.",
      "28": "But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he is making known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days.\n“While you were in bed, the dream and the visions that came to your head were as follows:",
      "29": "Your majesty, when you were in bed, thoughts came to your mind about what would happen in the future, and the Revealer of Secrets has made known to you what will take place.",
      "30": "As for me, this secret was made known to me, not because my own wisdom is greater than anyone else alive, but in order that the meaning may be made known to the king, and that you might understand the thoughts of your heart.",
      "31": "“Your majesty, while you were watching, you observed an enormous statue. This magnificent statue stood before you with extraordinary brilliance. Its appearance was terrifying.",
      "32": "That statue had a head made of pure gold, with its chest and arms made of silver, its abdomen and thighs made of bronze,",
      "33": "its legs made of iron, and its feet made partly of iron and partly of clay.",
      "34": "“As you were watching, a rock was quarried—but not with human hands—and it struck the iron and clay feet of the statue, breaking them to pieces.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together and became like chaff from a summer threshing floor that the breeze carries away without leaving a trace. Then the rock that struck the statue grew into a huge mountain and filled the entire earth.",
      "36": "“This was the dream, and we’ll now relate its meaning to the king.",
      "37": "You, your majesty, king of kings—to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory,",
      "38": "so that wherever people, wild animals, or birds of the sky live, he has placed them under your control, giving you dominion over them all—you’re that head of gold.",
      "39": "“After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze will arise to rule all the earth.",
      "40": "Then there will be a fourth kingdom, as strong as iron. Just as all things are broken to pieces and shattered by iron, so it will shatter and crush everything.",
      "41": "“The feet and toes that you saw, made partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, represent a divided kingdom. It will still have the strength of iron, in that you saw iron mixed with clay.",
      "42": "Just as their toes and feet are part iron and part clay, so will the kingdom be both strong and brittle.",
      "43": "Just as you saw iron mixed with clay, so they will mix themselves with human offspring. Furthermore, they won’t remain together, just as iron doesn’t mix with clay.",
      "44": "“During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor its sovereignty left in the hands of another people. It will shatter and crush all of these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.",
      "45": "Now, just as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without human hands—and that it crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold to pieces—so also the great God has revealed to the king what will take place after this. Your dream will come true, and its meaning will prove trustworthy.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face before Daniel, paid honor to him, and commanded that an offering and incense be presented on his behalf.",
      "47": "The king told Daniel, “Truly your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and the Revealer of Secrets, because you were able to reveal this mystery.”",
      "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel to a high position and lavished many great gifts on him, including making him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief administrator over the advisors of Babylon.",
      "49": "Moreover, Daniel requested that the king appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained in the royal court."

      "1": "Some time later, king Nebuchadnezzar built a golden statue, making it 60 cubits high and six cubits wide. He set it up in the Dura Valley within the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the regional authorities, governors, deputy governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all of the other administrators of the provinces, ordering them to come to the dedication of the statue that he had erected.",
      "3": "So the regional authorities, governors, deputy governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all of the other administrators of the provinces assembled to dedicate the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They took their places in front of the statue that he had erected.",
      "4": "Then a herald proclaimed aloud:\n“People of all nations, and languages are commanded:",
      "5": "Whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various instruments, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that was set up by King Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "6": "Anyone who does not fall down and worship is immediately to be thrown into the blazing fire furnace.”",
      "7": "Therefore, when all of the people “heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various other instruments,” all the “people, nations, and languages” began to fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "Just then, certain influential Chaldeans took this opportunity to come forward and denounce the Jews.",
      "9": "They told King Nebuchadnezzar, “Your majesty, live forever.",
      "10": "You, your majesty, issued this decree:\n‘Every man who hears the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various other instruments is to fall down and worship the golden statue.",
      "11": "Whoever does not fall down and worship is to be thrown into a blazing fire furnace.’",
      "12": "“Certain influential Jewish men whom you appointed to manage the city of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—have neither paid attention to you, your majesty, nor served your gods. And they won’t worship the golden statue that you set up.”",
      "13": "Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and furiously ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t worship my gods and that you don’t worship the golden statue that has been set up?",
      "15": "Now, if you are ready at this very moment to obey ‘the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp,’ and worship the image that I have made… If you do not so worship, you will immediately have cast yourselves into the middle of the blazing fire, and what god is there who can deliver you from my power?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar, “It’s not necessary for us to respond in this matter.",
      "17": "Your majesty, if it be his will, our God whom we serve can deliver us from the blazing fire furnace, and he will deliver us from you.",
      "18": "But if not, rest assured, your majesty, that we won’t serve your gods, and we won’t worship the golden statue that you have set up.”",
      "19": "Out of control with rage, Nebuchadnezzar’s facial expression changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual.",
      "20": "Then he issued orders to his elite guard to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego with ropes and throw them into the blazing fire furnace.",
      "21": "So the elite guard tied them up fully clothed, still wearing their robes, tunics, and turbans, and threw them into the blazing fire furnace,",
      "22": "because the king’s command was so drastic. Since the furnace was blazing hot, its flames killed those who threw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the blazing fire.",
      "23": "Bound firmly with ropes, these three men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the blazing fire furnace.",
      "24": "Astonished, King Nebuchadnezzar stood up in terror, and asked his advisors, “Didn’t we throw three men into the fire, bound firmly with ropes?”\nIn reply they told the king, “Yes, your majesty.”",
      "25": "“Look!” he told them, “I see four men walking untied and unharmed in the middle of the fire, and the appearance of the fourth resembles a divine being.”",
      "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the opening of the blazing fire furnace. He shouted out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.",
      "27": "The regional authorities, viceroys, governors, and royal advisors gazed at those men and saw that the fire had no effect on their bodies—not a hair on their head was singed, their clothes were not burned, and they did not smell of fire.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar spoke up and announced:\n“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego! He sent his angel to deliver his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king’s command and were willing to risk their lives in order not to serve or worship any god except their own God.",
      "29": "So I decree that people from any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego will be destroyed and their house reduced to rubble, because there is no other god who can save like this.”",

      "4": "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was resting in my home and prospering in my palace.",
      "5": "I had a dream that made me afraid. The thoughts that went through my mind while in bed and the visions in my head terrified me.",
      "6": "So I gave an order to bring in all of the advisors of Babylon so they would tell me the interpretation of the dream.",
      "7": "Then the diviners, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers came in, and I told them the dream. But they could not reveal its interpretation to me.",
      "8": "Eventually, Daniel appeared before me. (He is called Belteshazzar, in accordance with the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is within him.) I told him my dream:",

      "10": "This is what I saw in the visions of my head while I was in bed: I was looking and—listen carefully!—I saw a tree in the middle of the earth, the height of which was very great.",
      "11": "The tree grew large, became strong, and its top reached the sky. It could be seen to the ends of the earth.",
      "12": "Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit bountiful, and its food sufficient for everyone. The animals of the field found shade under it, the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and every creature was fed from it.",
      "13": "“Then I saw in the visions of my head while I was in bed—and take careful notice!—I saw a holy observer descend from heaven.",
      "14": "He called out aloud:\n‘Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get out from under it, and let the birds leave its branches.",
      "15": "Nevertheless, leave the stump and its roots in the ground, but bind it with iron and bronze in the field grass. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky, and let him graze with the animals in the grass of the earth.",
      "16": "Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the mind of an animal until seven seasons of time pass by for him.",
      "17": "This order is announced by the observers, and the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over human kingdoms and grants them to whomever he desires, and he places the least important of men over them.’",

      "21": "with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit—enough food for everyone—and under which wild animals of the field found shelter and the birds of the air had nests in its branches—",
      "22": "it’s you, your majesty! You’ve become great and strong, your greatness has grown to the heavens, and your dominion reaches to the distant parts of the earth.",
      "23": "“Your majesty saw a holy observer descending from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump in the ground, along with its roots, bound with iron and bronze in the field grass. Let him be soaked with the dew of the sky and live with the wild animals of the field until seven seasons pass over him.’",
