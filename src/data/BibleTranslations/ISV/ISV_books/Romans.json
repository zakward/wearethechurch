    "1": {
      "1": "From: Paul, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, called to be an apostle and set apart for God’s gospel,",
      "2": "which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures",
      "3": "regarding his Son. He was a descendant of David with respect to his humanity",
      "4": "and was declared by the resurrection from the dead to be the powerful Son of God according to the spirit of holiness—Jesus the Messiah, our Lord.",
      "5": "Through him we received grace and a commission as an apostle to bring about faithful obedience among all the gentiles for the sake of his name.",
      "6": "You, too, are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus the Messiah.",
      "7": "To: Everyone in Rome, loved by God and called to be holy.\nMay grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!",
      "8": "First of all, I thank my God through Jesus the Messiah for all of you, because the news about your faith is being reported throughout the world.",
      "9": "For God, whom I serve with my spirit by preaching the gospel about his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you",
      "10": "in my prayers at all times, asking that somehow by God’s will I may at last succeed in coming to you.",
      "11": "For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong,",
      "12": "that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.",
      "13": "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now), so that I might reap a harvest among you, just as I have among the rest of the gentiles.",
      "14": "Both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish people, I am a debtor.",
      "15": "That is why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God’s power for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first and of the Greek as well.",
      "17": "For in the gospel God’s righteousness is being revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”",
      "18": "For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of those who in their wickedness suppress the truth.",
      "19": "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God himself has made it plain to them.",
      "20": "For since the creation of the world God’s invisible attributes—his eternal power and divine nature—have been understood and observed by what he made, so that people are without excuse.",
      "21": "For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their senseless hearts were darkened.",
      "22": "Though claiming to be wise, they became fools",
      "23": "and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that looked like mortal human beings, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.",
      "24": "For this reason, God delivered them to sexual impurity as they followed the lusts of their hearts and dishonored their bodies with one another.",
      "25": "They exchanged God’s truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.",
      "26": "For this reason, God delivered them to degrading passions as their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural.",
      "27": "In the same way, their males also abandoned their natural sexual function toward females and burned with lust toward one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received within themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion.",
      "28": "Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to keep knowing God fully, God delivered them to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done.",
      "29": "They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,",
      "30": "slanderers, God-haters, haughty, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to their parents,",
      "31": "foolish, faithless, heartless, and ruthless.",
      "32": "Although they know God’s just requirement—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do these things but even applaud others who practice them."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore, you have no excuse—every one of you who judges. For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things.",
      "2": "Now we know that God’s judgment against those who act like this is based on truth.",
      "3": "So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?",
      "4": "Or are you unaware of his rich kindness, forbearance, and patience, that it is God’s kindness that is leading you to repent?",
      "5": "But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are reserving wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.",
      "6": "For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done:",
      "7": "eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good;",
      "8": "but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead.",
      "9": "There will be suffering and anguish for every human being who practices doing evil, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.",
      "10": "But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who practices doing good, initially for Jews but also for Greeks as well,",
      "11": "because God does not show partiality.",
      "12": "For all who have sinned apart from the Law will also perish apart from the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law.",
      "13": "For it is not merely those who hear the Law who are righteous in God’s sight. No, it is those who follow the Law, who will be justified.",
      "14": "For whenever gentiles, who do not possess the Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the Law.",
      "15": "They show that what the Law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them",
      "16": "on that day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, will judge people’s secrets according to my gospel.",
      "17": "Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the Law, and boast about God,",
      "18": "and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the Law;",
      "19": "and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,",
      "20": "an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the Law—",
      "21": "as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, do you steal?",
      "22": "As you forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? As you abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
      "23": "As you boast about the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?",
      "24": "As it is written, “God’s name is being blasphemed among the gentiles because of you.”",
      "25": "For circumcision is valuable if you observe the Law, but if you break the Law, your having been circumcised has no more value than if you were uncircumcised.",
      "26": "So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be regarded as circumcision, won’t it?",
      "27": "The man who is uncircumcised physically but who keeps the Law will condemn you who break the Law, even though you have the written Law and circumcision.",
      "28": "For a person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision something just external and physical.",
      "29": "No, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, brought about by the Spirit, not by a written law. That person’s praise will come from God, not from people."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "What advantage, then, does the Jew have, or what value is there in circumcision?",
      "2": "There are all kinds of advantages! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the utterances of God.",
      "3": "What if some of the Jews were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God’s faithfulness, can it?",
      "4": "Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written,\n“You are right when you speak,\n    and win your case when you go into court.”",
      "5": "But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God’s righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.)",
      "6": "Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?",
      "7": "For if through my falsehood God’s truthfulness glorifies him even more, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?",
      "8": "Or can we say—as some people slander us by claiming that we say—“Let’s do evil that good may result”? They deserve to be condemned!",
      "9": "What, then, does this mean? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have already accused everyone, both Jews and Greeks, of being under the power of sin.",
      "10": "As it is written,\n“Not even one person is righteous.",
      "11": "No one understands.\n    No one searches for God.",
      "12": "All have turned away.\n    They have become completely worthless.\n        No one shows kindness, not even one person!",
      "13": "Their throats are open graves.\n    With their tongues they deceive.\n        The venom of poisonous snakes is under their lips.",
      "14": "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.",
      "15": "They run swiftly to shed blood.",
      "16": "Ruin and misery characterize their lives.",
      "17": "They have not learned the path to peace.",
      "18": "They don’t fear God.",
      "19": "Now we know that whatever the Law says applies to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.",
      "20": "Therefore, God will not justify any human being by means of the actions prescribed by the Law, for through the Law comes the full knowledge of sin.",
      "21": "But now, apart from the Law, God’s righteousness is revealed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets—",
      "22": "God’s righteousness through the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah— for all who believe. For there is no distinction among people,",
      "23": "since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God’s glory.",
      "24": "By his grace they are justified freely through the redemption that is in the Messiah Jesus,",
      "25": "whom God offered as a place where atonement by the Messiah’s blood would occur through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because he had waited patiently to deal with sins committed in the past.",
      "26": "He wanted to demonstrate at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies anyone who has the faithfulness of Jesus.",
      "27": "What, then, is there to boast about? That has been eliminated. On what principle? On that of actions? No, but on the principle of faith.",
      "28": "For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the actions prescribed by the Law.",
      "29": "Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the gentiles, too? Yes, of the gentiles, too,",
      "30": "since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised by that same faith.",
      "31": "Do we, then, abolish the Law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the Law."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our human ancestor?",
      "2": "For if Abraham was justified by actions, he would have had something to boast about—though not before God.",
      "3": "For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "4": "Now to someone who works, wages are not considered a gift but an obligation.",
      "5": "However, to someone who does not work, but simply believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.",
      "6": "Likewise, David also speaks of the blessedness of the person whom God regards as righteous apart from actions:",
      "7": "“How blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven\n    and whose sins are covered!",
      "8": "How blessed is the person whose sins\n    the Lord will never charge against him!”",
      "9": "Now does this blessedness come to the circumcised alone, or also to the uncircumcised? For we say, “Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "10": "Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised? He had not yet been circumcised, but was uncircumcised.",
      "11": "Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them.",
      "12": "He is also the ancestor of the circumcised—those who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
      "13": "For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the Law, but through the righteousness produced by faith.",
      "14": "For if those who were given the Law are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless,",
      "15": "for the Law produces wrath. Now where there is no Law, neither can there be any violation of it.",
      "16": "Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may be a matter of grace and may be guaranteed for all of Abraham’s descendants—not only for those who were given the Law, but also for those who share the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.",
      "17": "As it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations.” Abraham acted in faith when he stood in the presence of God, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that don’t yet exist.",
      "18": "Hoping in spite of hopeless circumstances, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” just as he had been told: “This is how many descendants you will have.”",
      "19": "His faith did not weaken when he thought about his own body (which was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old) or about Sarah’s inability to have children,",
      "20": "nor did he doubt God’s promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, his faith became stronger and he gave glory to God,",
      "21": "being absolutely convinced that God would do what he had promised.",
      "22": "This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "23": "Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for him",
      "24": "but also for us. Our faith will be regarded in the same way, if we believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.",
      "25": "He was sentenced to death because of our sins and raised to life to justify us."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus the Messiah.",
      "2": "Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace by which we have been established, and we boast because of our hope in God’s glory.",
      "3": "Not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,",
      "4": "endurance produces character, and character produces hope.",
      "5": "Now this hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.",
      "6": "For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, the Messiah died for the ungodly.",
      "7": "For it is rare for anyone to die for a righteous person, though somebody might be brave enough to die for a good person.",
      "8": "But God demonstrates his love for us by the fact that the Messiah died for us while we were still sinners.",
      "9": "Now that we have been justified by his blood, how much more will we be saved from wrath through him!",
      "10": "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life!",
      "11": "Not only that, but we also continue to boast about God through our Lord Jesus the Messiah, through whom we have now been reconciled.",
      "12": "Just as sin entered the world through one man, and death resulted from sin, therefore everyone dies, because everyone has sinned.",
      "13": "Certainly sin was in the world before the Law was given, but no record of sin is kept when there is no Law.",
      "14": "Nevertheless, death ruled from the time of Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. He is a foreshadowing of the one who would come.",
      "15": "But God’s free gift is not like Adam’s offense. For if many people died as the result of one man’s offense, how much more have God’s grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus the Messiah, been showered on many people!",
      "16": "Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. For the sentence that followed one man’s offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses.",
      "17": "For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man’s offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus the Messiah!",
      "18": "Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone.",
      "19": "For just as through one man’s disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man’s obedience many people will be made righteous.",
      "20": "Now the Law crept in so that the offense would increase. But where sin increased, grace increased even more,",
      "21": "so that, just as sin ruled by bringing death, so also grace might rule by bringing justification that results in eternal life through Jesus the Messiah, our Lord."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "What should we say, then? Should we go on sinning so that grace may increase?",
      "2": "Of course not! How can we who died as far as sin is concerned go on living in it?",
      "3": "Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into union with the Messiah Jesus were baptized into his death?",
      "4": "Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into his death so that, just as the Messiah was raised from the dead by the Father’s glory, we too may live an entirely new life.",
      "5": "For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.",
      "6": "We know that our old natures were crucified with him so that our sin-laden bodies might be rendered powerless and we might no longer be slaves to sin.",
      "7": "For the person who has died has been freed from sin.",
      "8": "Now if we have died with the Messiah, we believe that we will also live with him,",
      "9": "for we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.",
      "10": "For when he died, he died once and for all as far as sin is concerned. But now that he is alive, he lives for God.",
      "11": "In the same way, you too must continuously consider yourselves dead as far as sin is concerned, but living for God through the Messiah Jesus.",
      "12": "Therefore, do not let sin rule your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.",
      "13": "Stop offering the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life and the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness to God.",
      "14": "For sin will not have mastery over you, because you are not under Law but under grace.",
      "15": "What, then, does this mean? Should we go on sinning because we are not under Law but under grace? Of course not!",
      "16": "Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?",
      "17": "But thank God that, though you were once slaves of sin, you became obedient from your hearts to that form of teaching with which you were entrusted!",
      "18": "And since you have been freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.",
      "19": "I am speaking in simple terms because of the frailty of your human nature. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater disobedience, so now, in the same way, you must offer the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness that leads to sanctification.",
      "20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were “free” as far as righteousness was concerned.",
      "21": "What benefit did you get from doing those things you are now ashamed of? For those things resulted in death.",
      "22": "But now that you have been freed from sin and have become God’s slaves, the benefit you reap is sanctification, and the result is eternal life.",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in union with the Messiah Jesus our Lord."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Don’t you realize, brothers—for I am speaking to people who know the Law—that the Law can press its claims over a person only as long as he is alive?",
      "2": "For a married woman is bound by the Law to her husband while he is living, but if her husband dies, she is released from the Law concerning her husband.",
      "3": "So while her husband is living, she will be called an adulterer if she lives with another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from this Law, so that she is not an adulterer if she marries another man.",
      "4": "In the same way, my brothers, through the Messiah’s body you also died as far as the Law is concerned, so that you may belong to another person, the one who was raised from the dead, and may bear fruit for God.",
      "5": "For while we were living according to our human nature, sinful passions were at work in our bodies by means of the Law, to bear fruit resulting in death.",
      "6": "But now we have been released from the Law by dying to what enslaved us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit, not under the old writings.",
      "7": "What should we say, then? Is the Law sinful? Of course not! In fact, I wouldn’t have become aware of sin if it had not been for the Law. I wouldn’t have known what it means to covet if the Law had not said, “You must not covet.”",
      "8": "But sin seized the opportunity provided by this commandment and produced in me all kinds of sinful desires, since apart from the Law, sin is dead.",
      "9": "At one time I was alive without any connection to the Law. But when the rule was revealed, sin sprang to life,",
      "10": "and I died. I found that the very rule that was intended to bring life actually brought death.",
      "11": "For sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the rule, deceived me and used it to kill me.",
      "12": "So then, the Law itself is holy, and the rule is holy, just, and good.",
      "13": "Now, did something good bring me death? Of course not! But in order that sin might be recognized as being sin, it used something good to cause my death, so that through the rule, sin might become more exposed as being sinful than ever before.",
      "14": "For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am merely human, sold as a slave to sin.",
      "15": "I don’t understand what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I want to do, but instead do what I hate.",
      "16": "Now if I practice what I don’t want to do, I am admitting that the Law is good.",
      "17": "As it is, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that is living in me.",
      "18": "For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but I cannot carry it out.",
      "19": "For I don’t do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don’t want to do.",
      "20": "But if I do what I don’t want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that is living in me.",
      "21": "So I find this to be a principle: when I want to do what is good, evil is right there with me.",
      "22": "For I delight in the Law of God in my inner being,",
      "23": "but I see in my body a different principle waging war with the Law in my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin that exists in my body.",
      "24": "What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is infected by death?",
      "25": "Thank God through Jesus the Messiah, our Lord, because with my mind I myself can serve the Law of God, even while with my human nature I serve the law of sin."
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in union with the Messiah Jesus.",
      "2": "For the Spirit’s law of life in the Messiah Jesus has set me free from the Law of sin and death.",
      "3": "For what the Law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did. By sending his own Son in the form of humanity, he condemned sin by being incarnate,",
      "4": "so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to human nature but according to the Spirit.",
      "5": "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.",
      "6": "To focus our minds on the human nature leads to death, but to focus our minds on the Spirit leads to life and peace.",
      "7": "That is why the mind that focuses on human nature is hostile toward God. It refuses to submit to the authority of God’s Law because it is powerless to do so.",
      "8": "Indeed, those who are under the control of human nature cannot please God.",
      "9": "You, however, are not under the control of the human nature but under the control of the Spirit, since God’s Spirit lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of the Messiah, he does not belong to him.",
      "10": "But if the Messiah is in you, your bodies are dead due to sin, but the spirit is alive due to righteousness.",
      "11": "And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then the one who raised the Messiah from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you.",
      "12": "Consequently, brothers, we are not—with respect to human nature, that is—under an obligation to live according to human nature.",
      "13": "For if you live according to human nature, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you continuously put to death the activities of the body, you will live.",
      "14": "For all who are led by God’s Spirit are God’s children.",
      "15": "For you have not received a spirit of slavery that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”",
