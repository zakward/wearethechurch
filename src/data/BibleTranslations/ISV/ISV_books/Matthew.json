      "6": "‘O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,\n    you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,\nbecause from you will come a ruler\n    who will shepherd my people Israel.’”",
      "7": "Then Herod secretly called together the wise men, found out from them the time the star had appeared,",
      "8": "and sent them to Bethlehem. He told them, “As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him.”",
      "9": "After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.",
      "10": "When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy.",
      "11": "After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",

      "13": "After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt,” he said. “Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”",
      "14": "So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and left at night for Egypt.",
      "15": "He stayed there until Herod’s death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”",
      "16": "Herod flew into a rage when he learned that he had been tricked by the wise men, so he ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions, who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.",
      "17": "Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,",

      "20": "“Get up,” he said. “Take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”",
      "21": "So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went into the land of Israel.",
      "22": "But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, after having been warned in a dream. So he left for the region of Galilee",

      "4": "John had clothing made of camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of grasshoppers and wild honey.",

      "6": "being baptized by him in the Jordan River while they confessed their sins.",
      "7": "But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he told them, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?",
      "8": "Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance!",
      "9": "Don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have father Abraham!’ because I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!",
      "10": "The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree that isn’t producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.",
      "11": "I am baptizing you with water as evidence of repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.",
      "12": "His winnowing fork is in his hand. He will clean up his threshing floor and gather his grain into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”",
      "13": "Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.",
      "14": "But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”",
      "15": "But Jesus answered him, “Let it be this way for now, because this is the proper way for us to fulfill all righteousness.”\nAt this, he permitted him to be baptized.",
      "16": "When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up out of the water. Suddenly, the heavens opened up for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.",
      "17": "Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him!”"

      "4": "But he answered, “It is written,\n‘One must not live on bread alone,\n    but on every word coming\n        out of the mouth of God.’”",
      "5": "Then the Devil took him to the Holy City and had him stand on the highest point of the Temple.",
      "6": "He told Jesus, “Since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it is written,\n‘God will put his angels in charge of you,’\nand,\n‘With their hands they will hold you up,\n    so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”",
      "7": "Jesus responded to him, “It is also written, ‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”",
      "8": "Once more the Devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, along with their splendor.",
      "9": "He told Jesus, “I will give you all these things if you will bow down and worship me!”",
      "10": "Then Jesus told him, “Go away, Satan! Because it is written,\n‘You must worship the Lord your God\n    and serve only him.’”",
      "11": "So the Devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him.",
      "12": "Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.",
      "13": "He left Nazareth and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,",
      "14": "in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,",
      "15": "“O Land of Zebulun and Land of Naphtali,\n    on the road to the sea, across the Jordan,\n        Galilee of the unbelievers!",
      "16": "The people living in darkness have seen a great light,\n    and for those living in the land and shadow of death,\n        a light has risen.”",
      "17": "From then on, Jesus began to announce, “Repent, because the kingdom from heaven is near!”",
      "18": "While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon (also called Peter) and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, because they were fishermen.",
      "19": "“Follow me,” he told them, “and I will make you fishers of people!”",
      "20": "So at once they left their nets and followed him.",

      "22": "they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.",
      "23": "Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.",
      "24": "His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him everyone who was sick—those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed—and he healed them.",
