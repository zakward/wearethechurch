      "6": "Then God said, “Let there be a canopy between bodies of water, separating bodies of water from bodies of water!”",
      "7": "So God made a canopy that separated the water beneath the canopy from the water above it. And that is what happened:",
      "8": "God called the canopy “sky.” The twilight and the dawn were the second day.",
      "9": "Then God said, “Let the water beneath the sky come together into one area, and let dry ground appear!” And that is what happened:",
      "10": "God called the dry ground “land,” and he called the water that had come together “oceans.” And God saw how good it was.",

      "14": "Then God said, “Let there be lights across the sky to distinguish day from night, to act as signs for seasons, days, and years,",
      "15": "to serve as lights in the sky, and to shine on the earth!” And that is what happened:",
      "16": "God fashioned two great lights—the larger light to shine during the day and the smaller light to shine during the night—as well as stars.",
      "17": "God placed them in space to shine on the earth,",
      "18": "to differentiate between day and night, and to distinguish light from darkness. And God saw how good it was.",

      "20": "Then God said, “Let the oceans swarm with living creatures, and let flying creatures soar above the earth throughout the sky!”",
      "21": "So God created every kind of magnificent marine creature, every kind of living marine crawler with which the waters swarmed, and every kind of flying creature. And God saw how good it was.",
      "22": "God blessed them by saying, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the oceans. Let the birds multiply throughout the earth!”",
      "23": "The twilight and the dawn were the fifth day.",
      "24": "Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth each kind of living creature, each kind of livestock and crawling thing, and each kind of earth’s animals!” And that is what happened:",
      "25": "God made each kind of the earth’s animals, along with every kind of livestock and crawling thing. And God saw how good it was.",
      "26": "Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, to be like us. Let them be masters over the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly, the livestock, everything that crawls on the earth, and over the earth itself!”",
      "27": "So God created mankind in his own image;\n    in his own image God created them;\n        he created them male and female.",
      "28": "God blessed the humans by saying to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it! Be masters over the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly, and every living thing that crawls on the earth!”",

      "17": "but you are not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because you will certainly die during the day that you eat from it.”",
      "18": "Later, the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make the woman to be an authority corresponding to him.”",
      "19": "After the Lord God formed from the ground every wild animal and every bird that flies, he brought each of them to the man to see what he would call it. Whatever the man called each living creature became its name.",
      "20": "The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds that fly, and to each of earth’s animals, but there was not found a strength corresponding to him,",
      "21": "so the Lord God caused a deep sleep to overshadow the man.\nWhen the man was asleep, he removed one of the man’s ribs and closed up the flesh where it had been.",
      "22": "Then the Lord God formed the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man.",
      "23": "So the man exclaimed,\n“At last! This is\n    bone from my bones\n        and flesh from my flesh.\nThis one will be called ‘Woman,’\n    because she was taken from Man.”",

      "3": "“but as for the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You are not to eat from it, nor are you to touch it, or you will die.’”",
      "4": "“You certainly will not die!” the Shining One told the woman.",
      "5": "“Even God knows that on the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you’ll become like God, knowing good and evil.”",
      "6": "When the woman saw that the tree produced good food, was attractive in appearance, and was desirable for making one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. Then she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate some, too.",
      "7": "As a result, they both understood what they had done, and they became aware that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.",

      "11": "“Who told you that you are naked?” God asked. “Did you eat fruit from the tree that I commanded you not to eat?”",
      "12": "The man answered, “The woman whom you provided for me gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate some of it.”",
      "13": "Then the Lord God asked the woman, “What did you do?”\n“The Shining One misled me,” the woman answered, “so I ate.”",

      "16": "He told the woman,\n“I’ll greatly increase the pain of your labor during childbirth.\n    It will be painful for you to bear children,\n“since your trust is turning toward your husband,\n    and he will dominate you.”",
      "17": "He told the man,\n“Because you have listened to what your wife said,\n    and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you,\n        ‘You are not to not eat from it,’\ncursed is the ground because of you.\n    You’ll eat from it through pain-filled labor\n        for the rest of your life.",

      "21": "The Lord God fashioned garments from animal skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.",

      "23": "therefore the Lord God expelled the man from the garden of Eden so he would work the ground from which he had been taken.",
      "24": "After he had expelled the man, the Lord God placed winged angels at the eastern end of the garden of Eden, along with a fiery, turning sword, to prevent access to the tree of life."

      "16": "Abraham agreed with Ephron, so he weighed out to Ephron the money to which he had agreed publicly while the Hittites were listening: 400 shekels of silver at the current merchant rate.",
      "17": "That’s how Ephron’s field in Machpelah, east of Mamre—the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were within the boundaries of the field—came to be deeded",

      "3": "as a promise to the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that you won’t acquire a wife for my son from the Canaanite women among whom I’m living.",

      "7": "“The Lord God of heaven, who brought me from my father’s house and from my family’s land, who spoke to me and promised me ‘I will give this land to your descendants,’ will send his angel ahead of you, and you are to acquire a wife for my son from there.",
      "8": "If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you’ll be free from this oath to me. Just don’t take my son back there!”",
      "9": "So the servant made a solemn oath to his master Abraham regarding this matter.",
      "10": "Then Abraham’s servant took ten camels from his master’s herd of camels and left on his journey with all kinds of gifts from his master’s inventory. Eventually, he traveled as far as Aram-naharaim, Nahor’s home town.",
      "11": "As evening approached, he had the camels kneel outside the town at the water well, right about the time when women customarily went out to draw water.",
      "12": "That’s when he prayed, “Lord God of my master Abraham, help me to succeed today. Please show your gracious love to my master Abraham.",

      "14": "May it be that the young woman to whom I ask, ‘Please, lower your jug so that I may drink,’ responds, ‘Have a drink, and I’ll water your camels as well.’ May she be the one whom you have chosen for your servant Isaac. This is how I’ll know that you have shown your gracious love to my master.”",

      "16": "The woman was very beautiful, young, and had not had sexual relations with a man. Going down to the spring, she filled her jug and turned for home.",

      "19": "When she had finished giving him a drink, she also said, “I’ll also draw water for your camels until they’ve had enough to drink.”",
      "20": "She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and ran to the well to draw again until she had drawn enough water for all ten of the servant’s camels.",
      "21": "The man stared at her in silence, waiting to see whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful.",
      "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her wrists, weighing 10 shekels and presented them to her.",
      "23": "He asked her, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”",
      "24": "“I am the daughter of Bethuel,” she answered. “He’s the son of Milcah and Nahor.",
      "25": "And yes,” she continued, “we have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place to spend the night.”",
      "26": "At this, the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord.",

      "28": "The young woman then ran ahead and informed her mother’s household what had happened.",
      "29": "Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to the man and met him at the spring.",
      "30": "And so it was, as soon as he saw the nose ring and bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and as soon as he heard what his sister Rebekah was saying about what the man had spoken to her, he went out to the man who was still standing by the camels at the spring!",
      "31": "“Come on,” Laban said. “The Lord has blessed you! So why are you standing out here when I’ve prepared some space in the house and a place for the camels?”",
      "32": "So the servant went to the house and unbridled the camels. They provided straw and feed for the camels and water for washing his feet and those of the men with him.",
      "33": "But when they had prepared a meal and set it in front of him, he said, “I’m not eating until I’ve spoken.”\n“Speak up!” Laban exclaimed.",
      "34": "“I’m Abraham’s servant,” he said.",
      "35": "“The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become wealthy. He has provided him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.",

      "37": "My master made me swear this oath: ‘You are not to select a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites in this land where I live.",
      "38": "Instead, you are to go to my father’s household, to my relatives, and choose a wife for my son there.’",
      "39": "“So I asked my master, ‘What if the woman won’t come back with me?’",
      "40": "“Abraham told me, ‘The Lord, who is with me wherever I go, will send his angel with you to make your journey successful. So you are to choose a wife for my son from my family, from my father’s household.",
      "41": "Only then will you be released from fulfilling my oath. However, when you come to my family, if they don’t give her to you, you’ll be released from fulfilling my oath.’",
      "42": "“So today I arrived at the spring and prayed, ‘Lord God of my master Abraham, if you wish to make the journey that I have traveled successful,",
      "43": "here I am standing by the spring. May it be that the young woman who comes out to draw water, from whom I request a little water from her jug to drink,",
      "44": "if she tells me to drink and also draws water for the camels, may she be the woman that the Lord has chosen for my master’s son.’",
      "45": "“Before I had finished praying, along came Rebekah with her jug on her shoulder! She went to the spring and drew some water. I asked her to please let me have a drink.",
      "46": "She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and told me, ‘Have a drink while I also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also gave my camels water to drink.",
      "47": "“That’s when I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’\n“She replied, ‘I’m the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore for him.’\n“So I gave her a ring for her nose and bracelets for her wrists.",
      "48": "I bowed down and worshipped the Lord, and I praised the Lord God of my master Abraham, who led me on the true way to request the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.",
      "49": "So now, if you wish to show gracious love and truth toward my master, tell me so. But if not, tell me, so that I may go elsewhere.”",
      "50": "“Since this has come from the Lord,” Laban and Bethuel both replied, “we cannot speak one way or another.",
      "51": "So here’s Rebekah—she’s right in front of you. Take her and go, so she can become a wife for your master’s son, just as the Lord has decreed.”",
      "52": "When Abraham’s servant heard what they had said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord.",
      "53": "Then the servant brought out some silver and gold items, along with some clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave gifts to her brother and to her mother.",
      "54": "He and the men with him ate and drank, and then they spent the night.\nWhen they got up the next morning, the servant requested, “Send me off to my master.”",
      "55": "But her brother and mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days—at least ten—and after that she may go.”",
      "56": "“Please don’t delay me,” the servant answered them. “The Lord has made my journey successful. Send me off so I can return to my master.”",
      "57": "But they said, “We’ll call the young lady and see what she has to say about this.”",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man?”\n“I will go,” she replied.",
      "59": "So they sent off their sister Rebekah, along with her personal assistant, Abraham’s servant, and his men.",
      "60": "As they were leaving, they all blessed Rebekah by saying,\n“Our sister, may you become the mother of tens of millions!\n    May your descendants take over\n        the city gates of those who hate them.”",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her young servant women got up, mounted their camels, and followed Abraham’s servant, who took Rebekah and went on his way.",
      "62": "Later on, as Isaac was returning one evening from Beer-lahai-roi (he had been living in the Negev),",
      "63": "Isaac went out walking in a field. He looked up, and all of a sudden there were some camels coming.",

      "65": "and asked the servant, “Who is that man coming in the field to meet us?”\n“That’s my master,” the servant told her. So she reached for a veil and covered herself.",
      "66": "Then the servant informed Isaac about everything he had done.",

      "16": "Furthermore, all of the wealth that God has stripped away from our father belongs to us now and to our children. So do everything that God tells you to do.”",
      "17": "So Jacob got up, seated his children and wives on camels,",

      "24": "That night, God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful what you say to Jacob, whether it’s one word good or bad.”",
      "25": "Meanwhile, Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain, where Laban had caught up with him. Laban and his relatives encamped on that same mountain in the hill country of Gilead, too.",
      "26": "Then Laban asked Jacob, “What did you do? You deceived me, carried off my daughters like you would war captives,",
      "27": "ran away from me secretly, and stole from me by not keeping me informed. Otherwise, I could have sent you off with a party and singing, accompanied by a band playing tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "As it is, you didn’t even allow me to kiss my grandchildren and daughters goodbye! You’ve acted foolishly.",
      "29": "It’s actually in my power to do some serious evil to you, but last night the God of your father told me, ‘Be careful what you say to Jacob whether good or evil.’",
      "30": "Now, you can go if you must go, because you certainly are longing to go to your father’s house. But why did you steal my gods?”",
      "31": "“I was afraid,” Jacob replied. “I thought you might take your daughters from me.",
      "32": "Now as to your gods, if you find someone has them in their possession, he’s a dead man. Take our relatives as witnesses, search through our belongings, and take whatever belongs to you that’s in my possession.” But Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen the idols.",
      "33": "So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, Leah’s tent, and the tents of the two maid servants, but he didn’t find them. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "Meanwhile, Rachel had taken the idols, placed them inside the saddle of her camel, and sat on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but found nothing.",
      "35": "Then Rachel told her father, “Sir, please don’t be angry that I cannot stand up in your presence. It’s that time of the month.” So Laban searched for the idols, but never did find them.",
      "36": "Then Jacob got angry and started an argument with Laban. “What have I done?” he demanded. “What’s my crime that would cause you to come pursue me so violently?",
      "37": "Now that you’ve searched all my belongings, what did you find that belongs to your house? Set it here in front of our relatives and we’ll let them judge between us!",
      "38": "Meanwhile, these past 20 years that I’ve been with you, your sheep and goats never had miscarriages, I never once ate any of the rams from your flock,",
      "39": "and whatever was torn by beasts, I never bothered to bring to you. Instead, I bore the losses myself. Even so, you demanded that I provide restitution for anything that was stolen, whether during the day or the night.",
      "40": "As it was, I was attacked by drought during the day and by cold at night. I never got any decent rest.",
      "41": "I’ve lived in your house these 20 years—serving fourteen years for your two daughters and another six years for your flocks. During all that time you changed my wages ten times.",
      "42": "If the God of my father—the God of Abraham, the God whom Isaac feared—had not been with me, you would have sent me away empty handed. But God saw my misery and how hard I’ve worked with my own hands—and he rebuked you last night.”",

      "44": "Come, let’s make a covenant just between you and me. And let it serve as a witness between you and me.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and raised it as a pillar.",

      "47": "Laban named the place Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed.",
      "48": "Then Laban said, “This stack will serve as a witness between you and me today.” That’s how the place came to be named Galeed.",
      "49": "It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the Lord watch between you and me, when we are estranged from each other.",
