      "1": "This message from the Lord came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of the Judean kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah concerning the vision he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem:",
      "2": "“Listen, people! All of you!\n    Earth! Pay attention, and all you inhabitants of it!\nMay the Lord God be a witness against you—\n    the Lord from his holy Temple.",
      "3": "Look here! The Lord is coming from his place!\n    He will come down\n        and will trample down the high places throughout the land.",
      "4": "The mountains will melt under him\n    and the valleys will split apart,\nlike wax in the presence of fire\n    and like water gushing down a steep incline.",
      "5": "All this comes about due to the transgression of Jacob,\n    and due to the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is Jacob’s sin? It’s Samaria, isn’t it?\n    And what’s Judah’s high place? It’s Jerusalem, isn’t it?",
      "6": "“So I will turn Samaria into a mound of dirt in a field,\n    a place to plant vineyards.\nAnd I will dump her building stones into the valley,\n    uncovering her foundation.",
      "7": "All of her carved images will be crushed to pieces,\n    all the earnings of her prostitution will be burned up,\n        and I will destroy all her idols;\nbecause she collected the wages of prostitution,\n    and to the wages of prostitution they will return.”",
      "8": "“Therefore I will cry out and grieve loudly;\n    I will walk around stripped and naked.\nI will cry out like a jackal\n    and mourn like a company of ostriches.",
      "9": "For Samaria’s injury is fatal,\n    reaching all the way to Judah,\n        extending even to the gate of my people—to Jerusalem.”",
      "10": "“Don’t discuss it in Gath!\n    Don’t cry bitterly in Akim!\n        Roll in the ashes, Beth-leaphrah!",
      "11": "Run away, you residents of Shaphir,\n    displaying your shameful nakedness.\nDon’t come out, you residents of Zaanan!\n    Your firm standing will disappear as Beth-ezel mourns.",
      "12": "Even though the inhabitants of Maroth long for success,\n    nevertheless evil descended from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "“You inhabitants of Lachish, harness your chariot to your swiftest steed—\n    the daughter of Zion has begun to sin—\nbecause within you the transgressions of Israel were revealed.",
      "14": "Therefore give your gifts to Moresheth-gath;\n    that is, the houses of Achzib as a deceitful symbol to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "Nevertheless, I will deliver an heir to you, inhabitants of Mareshah—\n    to Adullam the glory of Israel will come.",
      "16": "“Shave your head\n    and cut off your locks as you mourn your beloved children.\nMake yourself bald as an eagle,\n    because they will go from you into exile!”"

      "2": "They covet fields and seize them;\n    they covet houses, and grab them, too.\nThey harass the valiant man, along with his household,\n    an individual and his estate.",
      "3": "“Therefore this is what the Lord says,\n‘I’m crafting evil against this family,\n    from which you can’t escape.\nYou won’t strut around arrogantly,\n    because the times are evil.’",
      "4": "“When this happens, someone will compose a proverb about you, lamenting sorrowfully,\n    ‘We are completely ruined!\n        He has given my people’s heritage to others.\n    How he has removed it from me,\n        dividing up our fields!’",
      "5": "“This is why there will not be left even a single person\n    to settle boundary disputes in the Lord’s community.",
      "6": "To those who speak out, they will declare,\n    ‘Don’t prophesy to anyone!’\n        so their shame won’t go away.",
      "7": "“It is said, house of Jacob,\n    ‘The Spirit of the Lord is limited,\n        if he acts this way, is he not?’\n“But my words benefit those who live righteously, do they not?",
      "8": "Lately my people have acted like an enemy—\n    you strip travelers who thought they were as secure\n        as those who return from war.",
      "9": "You have evicted the wives of my people from their dream homes;\n    you have removed my majesty from their children permanently.",
      "10": "“Get up and go,\n    because there’s no rest for you here!\nSince everything is polluted, it can only cause destruction,\n    even heavy destruction.",
      "11": "Suppose a man who keeps company with a deceiving spirit prophesies like this:\n    ‘Drink wine and strong drink!’\n        Won’t the people accept him as a prophet?”",
      "12": "“Jacob, how I will surely gather all of you!\n    How I will gather the survivors of Israel!\nI will gather them together like sheep in a pen,\n    like the flock in the midst of the sheepfold.\n        There will be a great commotion because of all the people.",
      "13": "God will stand up and break through in their presence.\n    Then they will pass through the gate, going out by it.\nTheir king will pass in front of them\n    with the Lord at their head.”"

      "3": "You eat the flesh of my people,\n    flaying their skin from them.\nYou break their bones,\n    chopping them in pieces like meat for a pot,\n        like meat destined for a soup kettle.’",
      "4": "“Then they will cry to the Lord,\n    but he will not listen to them.\nIn fact, he will hide his face from them at that time,\n    because they were so wicked in what they were doing.”",
      "5": "“This is what the Lord says about the prophets\n    who are causing my people to go astray,\nwho are calling out ‘Peace’ when they’re being fed,\n    but who declare war against those who won’t feed them:",
      "6": "‘You will have nights without visions,\n    and darkness without prophecy.\nThe sun will set on the prophets,\n    and the day will darken for them.",
      "7": "Those who see visions will be put to shame,\n    and the diviners will be disgraced—every one of them—\nthey will cover their faces,\n    because there will be no answer from God.’”",
      "8": "“As for me, I am truly filled with power by the Spirit of the Lord,\n    filled with judgment and power\nto announce to Jacob his transgression,\n    and to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Please listen to this, you leaders of the house of Jacob,\n    you officials of the house of Israel,\nyou who hate administering justice,\n    who pervert the very meaning of equity,",
      "10": "who are building up Zion by means of bloodshed,\n    and Jerusalem by means of iniquity.",
      "11": "Her leaders judge for the money,\n    her priests teach only when they’re paid,\n        and her prophets prophesy for cash.\nEven so, don’t they all rely on the Lord as they ask,\n    ‘The Lord is among us, is he not?\n        Nothing bad can possibly happen to us!’",
      "12": "“Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,\n    and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,\n        and the Temple Mount like a forest high place.”"

      "2": "Many nations will approach and say,\n    ‘Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the Lord,\n        and to the Temple of the God of Jacob.\n    He will teach us about his ways,\n        and we will walk according to his directions.’\n“Indeed, the Law will proceed from Zion,\n    and the message of the Lord from Jerusalem.",
      "3": "And he will judge among many people,\n    rebuking strong nations far away;\nand they will reshape their swords as plowshares\n    and their spears as pruning hooks.\nNo nation will threaten another,\n    nor will they train for war anymore.",
      "4": "Instead, each man will sit in the shade of his grape vines\n    and beneath the shade of his fig tree,”\n        since the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has spoken.",
      "5": "“Because all of the people will walk,\n    each person in the name of his God,\n        and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.",

      "9": "Why are you crying so loud now?\n    There’s no king among you, is there?\nPerhaps your advisor has died?\n    For pain has overtaken you like a woman in labor.",
      "10": "Be in pain! Be in labor, you daughter of Zion,\n    like a woman about to give birth,\nbecause now you will depart from the city,\n    living in the open fields.\nTo Babylon you will go.\n    There you will be delivered,\n        there the Lord will rescue you from the power of your enemies.”",
      "11": "“Now many nations have gathered against you, saying,\n    ‘Let her be defiled,’ and\n        ‘Let’s look down on Zion.’",
