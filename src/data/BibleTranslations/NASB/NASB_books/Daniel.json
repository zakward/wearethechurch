      "1": "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.",
      "2": "And the Lord handed Jehoiakim king of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.",
      "3": "Then the king told Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,",
      "4": "youths in whom there was no impairment, who were good-looking, suitable for instruction in every kind of expertise, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability to serve in the king’s court; and he ordered Ashpenaz to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.",
      "5": "The king also allotted for them a daily ration from the king’s choice food and from the wine which he drank, and ordered that they be educated for three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king’s personal service.",
      "6": "Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",
      "7": "Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach, and to Azariah Abed-nego.",
      "8": "But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.",
      "9": "Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials.",
      "10": "The commander of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has allotted your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking gaunt in comparison to the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.”",
      "11": "But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
      "12": "“Please put your servants to the test for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
      "13": "Then let our appearance be examined in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”",
      "14": "So he listened to them in this matter, and put them to the test for ten days.",
      "15": "And at the end of ten days their appearance seemed better, and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king’s choice food.",
      "16": "So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.",
      "17": "And as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every kind of literature and expertise; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams.",
      "18": "Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "And the king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king’s personal service.",
      "20": "As for every matter of expertise and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the soothsayer priests and conjurers who were in all his realm.",
      "21": "And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king."

    "2": {
      "1": "Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.",
      "2": "Then the king gave orders to call in the soothsayer priests, the conjurers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.",
      "3": "The king said to them, “I had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.”",
      "4": "Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”",
      "5": "The king replied to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be turned into a rubbish heap.",
      "6": "But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.”",
      "7": "They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.”",
      "8": "The king replied, “I know for certain that you are trying to buy time, because you have perceived that the command from me is firm,",
      "9": "that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, so that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.”",
      "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is no person on earth who could declare the matter to the king, because no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any soothsayer priest, sorcerer, or Chaldean.",
      "11": "Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.”",
      "12": "Because of this, the king became angry and extremely furious, and he gave orders to kill all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "13": "So the decree was issued that the wise men be killed; and they looked for Daniel and his friends, to kill them.",
      "14": "Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon;",
      "15": "he said to Arioch, the king’s officer, “For what reason is the decree from the king so harsh?” Then Arioch informed Daniel of the matter.",
      "16": "So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him a grace period, so that he might declare the interpretation to the king.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,",
      "18": "so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;",
      "20": "Daniel said,\n“May the name of God be blessed forever and ever,\nFor wisdom and power belong to Him.",
      "21": "It is He who changes the times and the periods;\nHe removes kings and appoints kings;\nHe gives wisdom to wise men,\nAnd knowledge to people of understanding.",
      "22": "It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things;\nHe knows what is in the darkness,\nAnd the light dwells with Him.",
      "23": "To You, God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise,\nFor You have given me wisdom and power;\nEven now You have made known to me what we requested of You,\nFor You have made known to us the king’s matter.”",
      "24": "Thereupon, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to kill the wise men of Babylon; he went and said this to him: “Do not kill the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king’s presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.”",
      "25": "Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and spoke to him as follows: “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!”",
      "26": "The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?”",
      "27": "Daniel answered before the king and said, “As for the secret about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, sorcerers, soothsayer priests, nor diviners are able to declare it to the king.",
      "28": "However, there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed.",
      "29": "As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will take place.",
      "30": "But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living person, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.",
      "31": "“You, O king, were watching and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary radiance, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome.",
      "32": "The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,",
      "33": "its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.",
      "34": "You continued watching until a stone was broken off without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed to pieces all at the same time, and they were like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the entire earth.",
      "36": "“This was the dream; and now we will tell its interpretation before the king.",
      "37": "You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the honor;",
      "38": "and wherever the sons of mankind live, or the animals of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has handed them over to you and has made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "And after you another kingdom will arise inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.",
      "40": "Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; just as iron smashes and crushes everything, so, like iron that crushes, it will smash and crush all these things.",
      "41": "And in that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have within it some of the toughness of iron, since you saw the iron mixed with common clay.",
      "42": "And just as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong, and part of it will be fragile.",
      "43": "In that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in their descendants; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not combine with pottery.",
      "44": "And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever.",
      "45": "Just as you saw that a stone was broken off from the mountain without hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is certain and its interpretation is trustworthy.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid humble respect to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and incense.",
      "47": "The king responded to Daniel and said, “Your God truly is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”",
      "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon, and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "And Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king’s court."

    "3": {
      "1": "Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits, and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "Nebuchadnezzar the king also sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the chief treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",
      "3": "Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the chief treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "4": "Then the herald loudly proclaimed: “To you the command is given, you peoples, nations, and populations of all languages,",
      "5": "that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of musical instruments, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.",
      "6": "But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into the middle of a furnace of blazing fire.”",
      "7": "Therefore as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of musical instruments, all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",
      "8": "For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.",
      "9": "They began to speak and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: “O king, live forever!",
      "10": "You, O king, have made a decree that every person who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of musical instruments, is to fall down and worship the golden statue.",
      "11": "But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the middle of a furnace of blazing fire.",
      "12": "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods, nor do they worship the golden statue which you have set up.”",
      "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar began speaking and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods, nor worship the golden statue that I have set up?",
      "15": "Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe, and all kinds of musical instruments, to fall down and worship the statue that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can rescue you from my hands?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego replied to the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we are not in need of an answer to give you concerning this matter.",
      "17": "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will rescue us from your hand, O king.",
      "18": "But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods nor worship the golden statue that you have set up.”",
      "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.",
      "20": "And he ordered certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in order to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "21": "Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "22": "For this reason, because the king’s command was harsh and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.",
      "23": "But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the middle of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up.",
      "24": "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up quickly; he said to his counselors, “Was it not three men that we threw bound into the middle of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Absolutely, O king.”",
      "25": "He responded, “Look! I see four men untied and walking about in the middle of the fire unharmed, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!”",
      "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the middle of the fire.",
      "27": "The satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men, nor was the hair of their heads singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had even the smell of fire touched them.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and rescued His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king’s command, and surrendered their bodies rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.",
      "29": "Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or population of any language that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses made a rubbish heap, because there is no other god who is able to save in this way.”",

      "13": "For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment.",
      "14": "“Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also raise themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down.",
      "15": "Then the king of the North will come, pile up an assault ramp, and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand.",
      "16": "But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand.",
      "17": "And he will set his mind on coming with the power of his entire kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side.",
      "18": "Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his taunting against him; moreover, he will repay him for his taunting.",
      "19": "So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and not be found.",
      "20": "“Then in his place one will arise who will allow an oppressor to pass through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be broken, though not in anger nor in battle.",
      "21": "And in his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the majesty of kingship has not been conferred; but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue.",
      "22": "And the overflowing forces will be flooded away from him and smashed, and also the prince of the covenant.",
      "23": "After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people.",
      "24": "In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers did not, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, spoils, and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but only for a time.",
      "25": "And he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, because schemes will be devised against him.",
      "26": "Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain.",
      "27": "As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, because the end is still to come at the appointed time.",
      "28": "Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land.",
      "29": "“At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before.",
      "30": "For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will withdraw in fear and will return and curse the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and pay attention to those who abandon the holy covenant.",
      "31": "Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation.",
      "32": "And by smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.",
      "33": "And those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days.",
      "34": "Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy.",
      "35": "And some of those who have insight will fall, to refine, purge, and cleanse them until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time.",
      "36": "“Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt himself and boast against every god and will speak dreadful things against the God of gods; and he will be successful until the indignation is finished, because that which is determined will be done.",
      "37": "And he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will boast against them all.",
      "38": "But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, precious stones, and treasures.",
      "39": "And he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will make them rulers over the many, and will parcel out land for a price.",
      "40": "“And at the end time the king of the South will wage war with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them, and pass through.",
      "41": "He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the sons of Ammon.",
      "42": "Then he will reach out with his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.",
      "43": "But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.",
      "44": "But rumors from the East and from the North will terrify him, and he will go out with great wrath to eliminate and annihilate many.",
      "45": "And he will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him."

And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued.",
      "2": "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt.",
