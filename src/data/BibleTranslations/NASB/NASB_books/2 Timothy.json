      "4": "longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.",
      "5": "For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelled in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.",
      "6": "For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.",
      "7": "For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.",
      "8": "Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,",
      "9": "who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,",
      "10": "but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,",
      "11": "for which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.",
      "12": "For this reason I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to protect what I have entrusted to Him until that day.",
      "13": "Hold on to the example of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "Protect, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.",
      "15": "You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.",
      "16": "The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;",
      "17": "but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—",

      "15": "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.",
      "16": "But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,",
      "17": "and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,",
      "18": "men who have gone astray from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already taken place; and they are jeopardizing the faith of some.",
      "19": "Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His;” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to keep away from wickedness.”",
      "20": "Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver implements, but also implements of wood and of earthenware, and some are for honor while others are for dishonor.",
      "21": "Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be an implement for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.",

      "24": "The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged,",
      "25": "with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,",

      "4": "treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,",
      "5": "holding to a form of godliness although they have denied its power; avoid such people as these.",

      "7": "always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
      "8": "Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, worthless in regard to the faith.",
      "9": "But they will not make further progress; for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just as was that also of Jannes and Jambres.",

      "11": "persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!",
      "12": "Indeed, all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.",
      "13": "But evil people and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.",

      "5": "But as for you, use self-restraint in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.",
