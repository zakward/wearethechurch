      "1": "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
      "2": "Listen, heavens, and hear, earth;\nFor the Lord has spoken:\n“Sons I have raised and brought up,\nBut they have revolted against Me.",
      "3": "An ox knows its owner,\nAnd a donkey its master’s manger,\nBut Israel does not know,\nMy people do not understand.”",
      "4": "Oh, sinful nation,\nPeople weighed down with guilt,\nOffspring of evildoers,\nSons who act corruptly!\nThey have abandoned the Lord,\nThey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nThey have turned away from Him.",
      "5": "Where will you be stricken again,\nAs you continue in your rebellion?\nThe entire head is sick\nAnd the entire heart is faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head\nThere is nothing healthy in it,\nOnly bruises, slashes, and raw wounds;\nNot pressed out nor bandaged,\nNor softened with oil.",
      "7": "Your land is desolate,\nYour cities are burned with fire;\nAs for your fields, strangers are devouring them in front of you;\nIt is desolation, as overthrown by strangers.",
      "8": "The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,\nLike a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, like a city under watch.",
      "9": "If the Lord of armies\nHad not left us a few survivors,\nWe would be like Sodom,\nWe would be like Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou rulers of Sodom;\nListen to the instruction of our God,\nYou people of Gomorrah!",
      "11": "“What are your many sacrifices to Me?”\nSays the Lord.\n“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nAnd the fat of fattened cattle;\nAnd I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.",
      "12": "When you come to appear before Me,\nWho requires of you this trampling of My courtyards?",
      "13": "Do not go on bringing your worthless offerings,\nIncense is an abomination to Me.\nNew moon and Sabbath, the proclamation of an assembly—\nI cannot endure wrongdoing and the festive assembly.",
      "14": "I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts,\nThey have become a burden to Me;\nI am tired of bearing them.",
      "15": "So when you spread out your hands in prayer,\nI will hide My eyes from you;\nYes, even though you offer many prayers,\nI will not be listening.\nYour hands are covered with blood.",
      "16": "“Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean;\nRemove the evil of your deeds from My sight.\nStop doing evil,",
      "17": "Learn to do good;\nSeek justice,\nRebuke the oppressor,\nObtain justice for the orphan,\nPlead for the widow’s case.",
      "18": "“Come now, and let us debate your case,”\nSays the Lord,\n“Though your sins are as scarlet,\nThey shall become as white as snow;\nThough they are red like crimson,\nThey shall be like wool.",
      "19": "If you are willing and obedient,\nYou will eat the best of the land;",
      "20": "But if you refuse and rebel,\nYou will be devoured by the sword.”\nFor the mouth of the Lord has spoken.",
      "21": "How the faithful city has become a prostitute,\nShe who was full of justice!\nRighteousness once dwelt in her,\nBut now murderers.",
      "22": "Your silver has become waste matter,\nYour drink diluted with water.",
      "23": "Your rulers are rebels\nAnd companions of thieves;\nEveryone loves a bribe\nAnd chases after gifts.\nThey do not obtain justice for the orphan,\nNor does the widow’s case come before them.",
      "24": "Therefore the Lord God of armies,\nThe Mighty One of Israel, declares,\n“Ah, I will have satisfaction against My adversaries,\nAnd avenge Myself on My enemies.",
      "25": "I will also turn My hand against you,\nAnd smelt away your impurities as with lye;\nAnd I will remove all your slag.",
      "26": "Then I will restore your judges as at first,\nAnd your counselors as at the beginning;\nAfter that you will be called the city of righteousness,\nA faithful city.”",
      "27": "Zion will be redeemed with justice\nAnd her repentant ones with righteousness.",
      "28": "But wrongdoers and sinners together will be broken,\nAnd those who abandon the Lord will come to an end.",
      "29": "You certainly will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,\nAnd you will be embarrassed by the gardens which you have chosen.",
      "30": "For you will be like an oak whose leaf withers away,\nOr like a garden that has no water.",
      "31": "The strong man will become like flax fiber,\nAnd his work a spark.\nSo they shall both burn together\nAnd there will be no one to extinguish them."

      "3": "And many peoples will come and say,\n“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the Lord,\nTo the house of the God of Jacob;\nSo that He may teach us about His ways,\nAnd that we may walk in His paths.”\nFor the law will go out from Zion\nAnd the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.",

      "5": "Come, house of Jacob, and let’s walk in the light of the Lord.",

      "7": "Their land has also been filled with silver and gold\nAnd there is no end to their treasures;\nTheir land has also been filled with horses,\nAnd there is no end to their chariots.",
      "8": "Their land has also been filled with idols;\nThey worship the work of their hands,\nThat which their fingers have made.",
      "9": "So the common person has been humbled\nAnd the person of importance has been brought low,\nBut do not forgive them.",
      "10": "Enter the rocky place and hide in the dust\nFrom the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of His majesty.",
      "11": "The proud look of humanity will be brought low,\nAnd the arrogance of people will be humbled;\nAnd the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.",
      "12": "For the Lord of armies will have a day of reckoning\nAgainst everyone who is arrogant and haughty,\nAnd against everyone who is lifted up,\nThat he may be brought low.",
      "13": "And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up,\nAgainst all the oaks of Bashan,",
      "14": "Against all the lofty mountains,\nAgainst all the hills that are lifted up,",
      "15": "Against every high tower,\nAgainst every fortified wall,",
      "16": "Against all the ships of Tarshish\nAnd against all the delightful ships.",

      "18": "And the idols will completely vanish.",
      "19": "People will go into caves of the rocks\nAnd into holes in the ground\nAway from the terror of the Lord\nAnd the splendor of His majesty,\nWhen He arises to terrify the earth.",
      "20": "On that day people will throw away to the moles and the bats\nTheir idols of silver and their idols of gold,\nWhich they made for themselves to worship,",
      "21": "In order to go into the clefts of the rocks and the crannies of the cliffs\nBefore the terror of the Lord and the splendor of His majesty,\nWhen He arises to terrify the earth.",

      "5": "And the people will be oppressed,\nEach one by another, and each one by his neighbor;\nThe youth will assault the elder,\nAnd the contemptible person will assault the one honored.",
      "6": "When a man lays hold of his brother in his father’s house, saying,\n“You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler!\nAnd these ruins will be under your authority,”",
      "7": "He will protest on that day, saying,\n“I will not be your healer,\nFor in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;\nYou should not appoint me ruler of the people.”",
      "8": "For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,\nBecause their speech and their actions are against the Lord,\nTo rebel against His glorious presence.",
      "9": "The expression of their faces testifies against them,\nAnd they display their sin like Sodom;\nThey do not even conceal it.\nWoe to them!\nFor they have done evil to themselves.",
      "10": "Say to the righteous that it will go well for them,\nFor they will eat the fruit of their actions.",
