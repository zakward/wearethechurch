      "12": "So he looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one around, he struck and killed the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand.",
      "13": "Now he went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, “Why are you striking your companion?”",
      "14": "But he said, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Surely the matter has become known!”",

      "16": "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.",
      "17": "Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.",
      "18": "When they came to their father Reuel, he said, “Why have you come back so soon today?”",
      "19": "They said, “An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew water for us and watered the flock.”",
      "20": "So he said to his daughters, “Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”",
      "21": "And Moses was willing to live with the man. And he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.",

      "10": "And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.”",
      "11": "But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?”",

      "14": "And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “This is what you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”",
      "15": "God furthermore said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is the name for all generations to use to call upon Me.",

      "18": "Then they will pay attention to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’",
      "19": "But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion.",

      "9": "But if they will not believe even these two signs nor pay attention to what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will turn into blood on the dry ground.”",
      "10": "Then Moses said to the Lord, “Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”",
      "11": "But the Lord said to him, “Who has made the human mouth? Or who makes anyone unable to speak or deaf, or able to see or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?",
      "12": "Now then go, and I Myself will be with your mouth, and instruct you in what you are to say.”",

      "28": "Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.",

      "12": "So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.",

      "14": "Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not completed your required task of making bricks either yesterday or today, as before?”",

      "16": "There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people.”",
      "17": "But he said, “You are lazy, very lazy; for that reason you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’",
      "18": "So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, but you must deliver the quota of bricks.”",
      "19": "The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble, since they were told, “You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks.”",
      "20": "When they left Pharaoh’s presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.",

      "22": "Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?",
