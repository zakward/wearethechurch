      "3": "Then David said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”",
      "4": "David said to him, “How did things go? Please tell me.” And he said, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”",
      "5": "Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "The young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen had overtaken him.",
      "7": "When he looked behind himself, he saw me, and called to me. And I said, ‘Here I am.’",
      "8": "Then he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "And he said to me, ‘Please stand next to me and finish me off, for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.’",
      "10": "So I stood next to him and finished him off, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which was on his head and the band which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”",
      "11": "Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so also did all the men who were with him.",
      "12": "And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the Lord and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.",
      "13": "Then David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.”",
      "14": "And David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to reach out with your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”",
      "15": "Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come forward, put him to death.” So he struck him and he died.",
      "16": "And David said to him, “Your blood is on your head, because your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have finished off the Lord’s anointed.’”",
      "17": "Then David sang this song of mourning over Saul and his son Jonathan,",
      "18": "and he told them to teach the sons of Judah the mourning song of the bow; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar.",

      "2": "So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.",
      "3": "And David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household; and they settled in the cities of Hebron.",
      "4": "Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.\nAnd they told David, saying, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.”",

      "8": "But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.",
      "9": "And he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel.",
      "10": "Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.",
      "11": "And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.",
      "12": "Now Abner the son of Ner, went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul.",
      "13": "And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, Abner’s men on the one side of the pool and Joab’s men on the other side of the pool.",
      "14": "Then Abner said to Joab, “Now have the young men arise and hold a martial skills match in our presence.” And Joab said, “Have them arise!”",
      "15": "So they got up and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.",
      "16": "And each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.",
      "17": "That day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David.",
      "18": "Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles that is in the field.",
      "19": "Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner.",
      "20": "Then Abner looked behind himself and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” And he said, “It is I!”",
      "21": "So Abner said to him, “Turn aside for your own good to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his equipment.” But Asahel was unwilling to turn aside from following him.",
      "22": "Then Abner repeated again to Asahel, “Turn aside for your own good from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I show my face to your brother Joab?”",
      "23": "However, he refused to turn aside; so Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died on the spot. And it happened that all who came thereafter to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.",
      "24": "But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah by way of the wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "And the sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one troop, and they stood on the top of a hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Should the sword devour forever? Do you not realize that it will be bitter in the end? So how long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from pursuing their kinsmen?”",
      "27": "Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people of Judah certainly would have withdrawn in the morning, each from pursuing his brother.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people halted and no longer pursued Israel, nor did they continue to fight anymore.",
      "29": "Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim.",
      "30": "Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner; but he gathered all the people together, and nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel.",
      "31": "However, the servants of David had struck and killed many of Benjamin and Abner’s men; 360 men were dead.",
      "32": "And they carried Asahel away and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night until the day dawned at Hebron."

      "5": "and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron.",
      "6": "Now it happened that while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.",
      "7": "And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”",
      "8": "Then Abner became very angry over Ish-bosheth’s question and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not let you fall into the hands of David; yet today you call me to account for wrongdoing with that woman?",
      "9": "May God do so to me, and more so, if as the Lord has sworn to David, I do not accomplish this for him:",
      "10": "to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba!”",
      "11": "And Ish-bosheth could no longer say a word in response to Abner, because he was afraid of him.",
      "12": "Then Abner sent messengers to David at his place, saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.”",
      "13": "And he said, “Good! I will make a covenant with you, only I require one thing of you, namely, that you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.”",
      "14": "So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”",
      "15": "Ish-bosheth sent men and had her taken from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.",
      "16": "And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, following her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned.",
      "17": "Now Abner had a consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you.",
      "18": "Now then, do it! For the Lord has spoken regarding David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hands of all their enemies.’”",
      "19": "Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak to David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and to the entire house of Benjamin.",
      "20": "Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David held a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.",
      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me set out and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.” So David let Abner go, and he went in peace.",
      "22": "And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought a large amount of plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, since he had let him go, and he had gone in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they informed Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go on his way, and he has gone in peace.”",
      "24": "Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you let him go, so that he is already gone?",
      "25": "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to gain your confidence, and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out everything that you are doing.”",
      "26": "When Joab left David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know about it.",
      "27": "So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly, so that he died on account of the blood of his brother Asahel.",
      "28": "Afterward, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.",
      "29": "May it turn upon the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and may there not be eliminated from the house of Joab someone who suffers a discharge, or has leprosy, or holds the spindle, or falls by the sword, or lacks bread.”",
      "30": "So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.",
      "31": "Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier.",
      "32": "And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.",
      "33": "And the king sang a song of mourning for Abner and said,\n“Should Abner die as a fool dies?",
      "34": "Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in bronze shackles;\nAs one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept over him again.",
      "35": "Then all the people came to provide food for David in his distress while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, “May God do so to me, and more so, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.”",
      "36": "Now all the people took note of David’s vow, and it pleased them, just as everything that the king did pleased all the people.",
      "37": "So all the people and all Israel understood on that day that it had not been the desire of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.",
      "38": "Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?",
      "39": "And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer in proportion to his evil.”"

      "1": "Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was horrified.",
      "2": "And Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of troops: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,",
      "3": "and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as strangers until this day).",
      "4": "Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was disabled in both feet. He was five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled. But it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and could no longer walk. And his name was Mephibosheth.",
      "5": "So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while he was taking his midday rest.",
      "6": "And they came to the interior of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.",
      "7": "Now when they had come into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him, and they beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night.",
      "8": "Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; so the Lord has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.”",
      "9": "But David replied to Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,",
      "10": "when the one who informed me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ also viewed himself as the bearer of good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.",
      "11": "How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and eliminate you both from the earth?”",
      "12": "Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet, and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."

    "5": {
      "1": "Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.",
      "2": "Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a leader over Israel.’”",
      "3": "So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the Lord in Hebron; then they anointed David king over Israel.",
      "4": "David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned for forty years.",
      "5": "At Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.",
      "6": "Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they said to David, “You shall not come in here, but even those who are blind and those who limp will turn you away,” thinking, “David cannot enter here.”",
      "7": "Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.",
      "8": "And David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites is to reach those who limp and those who are blind, who are hated by David’s soul, through the water tunnel.” For that reason they say, “People who are blind and people who limp shall not come into the house.”",
      "9": "So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.",
      "10": "David became greater and greater, for the Lord God of armies was with him.",
      "11": "Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters, and stonemasons; and they built a house for David.",
      "12": "And David realized that the Lord had appointed him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.",
      "13": "Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.",
      "14": "Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,",
      "15": "Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,",
      "16": "Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.",
      "17": "Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard about it, he went down to the stronghold.",
      "18": "Now the Philistines came and overran the Valley of Rephaim.",
      "19": "So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?” And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly hand the Philistines over to you.”",
      "20": "Then David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said, “The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim.",
      "21": "And the Philistines abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.",
      "22": "Now the Philistines came up once again and overran the Valley of Rephaim.",
      "23": "So David inquired of the Lord, but He said, “You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the baka-shrubs.",
      "24": "And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baka-shrubs, then you shall act promptly, for then the Lord will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”",

      "3": "They had mounted the ark of God on a new cart and moved it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.",
      "4": "So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark.",
      "5": "Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of instruments made of juniper wood, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.",

      "11": "The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household.",
      "12": "Now it was reported to King David, saying, “The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God.” So David went and brought the ark of God up from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with joy.",
      "13": "And so it was, that when those carrying the ark of the Lord marched six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened steer.",
      "14": "And David was dancing before the Lord with all his strength, and David was wearing a linen ephod.",
      "15": "So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord with joyful shouting and the sound of the trumpet.",
      "16": "Then it happened, as the ark of the Lord was coming into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she was contemptuous of him in her heart.",

For he exposed himself today in the sight of his servants’ female slaves, as one of the rabble shamelessly exposes himself!”",
      "21": "But David said to Michal, “I was before the Lord, who preferred me to your father and to all his house, to appoint me as ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. So I will celebrate before the Lord!",
      "22": "And I might demean myself even more than this and be lowly in my own sight, but with the female slaves of whom you have spoken, with them I am to be held in honor!”",

      "37": "Now Absalom had fled and gone to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.",
      "38": "So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there for three years.",
      "39": "And the heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted regarding Amnon, since he was dead."

    "14": {
      "1": "Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was drawn toward Absalom.",
      "2": "So Joab sent a messenger to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please follow mourning rites, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for many days.",
      "3": "Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.",
      "4": "Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, “Help, O king!”",
      "5": "And the king said to her, “What is troubling you?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead.",
      "6": "And your servant had two sons, but the two of them fought in the field, and there was no one to save them from each other, so one struck the other and killed him.",
      "7": "Now behold, the entire family has risen against your servant, and they have said, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and eliminate the heir as well.’ So they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”",
      "8": "Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will issue orders concerning you.”",
      "9": "The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, the king, the guilt is on me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.”",
      "10": "So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.”",
      "11": "Then she said, “May the king please remember the Lord your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”",
      "12": "Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”",
      "13": "The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is like one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.",
      "14": "For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up. Yet God does not take away life, but makes plans so that the banished one will not be cast out from Him.",
      "15": "Now then, the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your servant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his slave.",
      "16": "For the king will listen, to save his slave from the hand of the man who would eliminate both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’",
      "17": "Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the Lord your God be with you.’”",
      "18": "Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.”",
      "19": "So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.",
      "20": "In order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is on the earth.”",
      "21": "Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will certainly do this thing; go then, bring back the young man Absalom.”",
      "22": "And Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself, and blessed the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”",
      "23": "So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "However, the king said, “He shall return to his own house, but he shall not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.",
      "25": "Now in all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the top of his head there was no impairment in him.",
      "26": "And when he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, because it was heavy on him, so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels by the king’s weight.",
      "27": "And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.",
      "28": "Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, yet he did not see the king’s face.",
      "29": "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he would not come.",
      "30": "Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s plot is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the plot on fire.",
      "31": "Then Joab got up, came to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my plot on fire?”",
      "32": "Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there.”’ Now then, let me see the king’s face, and if there is guilt in me, he can have me executed.”",
      "33": "So when Joab came to the king and told him, he summoned Absalom. Then Absalom came to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."
    },
    "15": {
      "1": "Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him.",
      "2": "And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road to the gate; and when any man who had a lawsuit was to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”",
      "3": "Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but you have no one to listen to you on the part of the king.”",
      "4": "Moreover, Absalom would say, “Oh that someone would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has a lawsuit or claim could come to me, and I would give him justice!”",
      "5": "And whenever a man approached to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.",
      "6": "Absalom dealt this way with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.",
      "7": "Now it came about at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the Lord, in Hebron.",
      "8": "For your servant made a vow while I was living in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.’”",
      "9": "The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron.",
      "10": "But Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”",
      "11": "Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, for they did not know anything.",
      "12": "And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people continually increased with Absalom.",
      "13": "Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”",
      "14": "So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let’s flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom. Go quickly, or he will hurry and overtake us, and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”",
      "15": "Then the king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants will do whatever my lord the king chooses.”",
      "16": "So the king left, and all his household with him; but the king left ten concubines behind to take care of the house.",
      "17": "The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house.",
      "18": "Now all of his servants passed by beside him, and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed by before the king.",
      "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us too? Return and stay with your king, since you are a foreigner and an exile as well; return to your own place.",
      "20": "You came only yesterday, so should I make you wander with us today, while I go wherever I go? Return and take your brothers back; mercy and truth be with you.”",
      "21": "But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there assuredly shall your servant be!”",
      "22": "Then David said to Ittai, “Go and cross over the brook Kidron.” So Ittai the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.",
      "23": "While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people were crossing over. The king was also crossing over the brook Kidron, and all the people were crossing over toward the way of the wilderness.",
      "24": "Now behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city.",
      "25": "And the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the Lord, then He will bring me back and show me both it and His habitation.",
      "26": "But if He says this: ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.”",
      "27": "The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.",
      "28": "See, I am going to wait at the river crossing places of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.",
      "30": "And David was going up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, and his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his own head, and they were going up, weeping as they went.",
      "31": "Now someone informed David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “Lord, please make the advice of Ahithophel foolish.”",
      "32": "It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn, and dust on his head.",
      "33": "And David said to him, “If you go over with me, then you will become a burden to me.",
      "34": "But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; even as I was your father’s servant in time past, so now I will also be your servant,’ then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me.",
      "35": "Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",
      "36": "Behold their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear.”",

      "2": "And the king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is weary in the wilderness to drink.”",
      "3": "Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’”",
      "4": "So the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself; may I find favor in your sight, my lord, the king!”",
      "5": "When King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man was coming out from there from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he was coming out, cursing as he came.",
      "6": "He also threw stones at David and all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left.",

      "8": "The Lord has brought back upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have become king; and the Lord has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. And behold, you are caught in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!”",
      "9": "Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Now let me go over and cut off his head.”",
      "10": "But the king said, “What business of mine is yours, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the Lord has told him, ‘Curse David,’ then who should say, ‘Why have you done so?’”",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my son who came out of my own body seeks my life; how much more now this Benjaminite? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the Lord has told him.",
      "12": "Perhaps the Lord will look on my misery and return good to me instead of his cursing this day.”",
      "13": "So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei kept going on the hillside close beside him, and as he went he cursed and threw stones and dirt at him.",
      "14": "And the king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.",

      "17": "But Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”",
      "18": "So Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whomever the Lord, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I shall remain.",
      "19": "Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? Just as I have served in your father’s presence, so I shall be in your presence.”",

      "23": "Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was taken as though one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel regarded by both David and Absalom."

      "36": "Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. So why should the king compensate me with this reward?",
      "37": "Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”",

      "43": "But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt?
