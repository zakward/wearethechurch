      "6": "And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,\n“And let all the angels of God worship Him.”",

      "7": "You have made him for a little while lower than angels;\nYou have crowned him with glory and honor;",
      "8": "You have put everything in subjection under his feet.”\nFor in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.",

      "13": "And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.",

      "14": "saying, “indeed I will greatly bless you and I will greatly multiply you.”",
