  "1 Samuel": {
    "1": {
      "1": "Now there was a man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of armies in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the Lord there.",
      "4": "When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;",
      "5": "but to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed her womb.",
      "6": "Her rival, moreover, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the Lord had closed her womb.",
      "7": "And it happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, that she would provoke her; so she wept and would not eat.",
      "8": "Then Elkanah her husband would say to her, “Hannah, why do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.",
      "10": "She, greatly distressed, prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly.",
      "11": "And she made a vow and said, “Lord of armies, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your bond-servant and remember me, and not forget Your bond-servant, but will give Your bond-servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head.”",
      "12": "Now it came about, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were quivering, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.",
      "14": "Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like a drunk? Get rid of your wine!”",
      "15": "But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman despairing in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.",
      "16": "Do not consider your bond-servant a useless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.”",
      "17": "Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of Him.”",
      "18": "She said, “Let your bond-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.",
      "19": "Then they got up early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.",
      "20": "It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him of the Lord.”",
      "21": "Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.",
      "22": "But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “I will not go until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the Lord and stay there for life.”",
      "23": "Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Stay until you have weaned him; only may the Lord confirm His word.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.",
      "24": "Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull, one ephah of flour, and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, although the child was young.",
      "25": "Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "And she said, “Pardon me, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.",
      "27": "For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my request which I asked of Him.",
      "28": "So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.” And he worshiped the Lord there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Then Hannah prayed and said,\n“My heart rejoices in the Lord;\nMy horn is exalted in the Lord,\nMy mouth speaks boldly against my enemies,\nBecause I rejoice in Your salvation.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like the Lord,\nIndeed, there is no one besides You,\nNor is there any rock like our God.",
      "3": "Do not go on boasting so very proudly,\nDo not let arrogance come out of your mouth;\nFor the Lord is a God of knowledge,\nAnd with Him actions are weighed.",
      "4": "The bows of the mighty are broken to pieces,\nBut those who have stumbled strap on strength.",
      "5": "Those who were full hire themselves out for bread,\nBut those who were hungry cease to be hungry.\nEven the infertile woman gives birth to seven,\nBut she who has many children languishes.",
      "6": "The Lord puts to death and makes alive;\nHe brings down to Sheol and brings up.",
      "7": "The Lord makes poor and rich;\nHe humbles, He also exalts.",
      "8": "He raises the poor from the dust,\nHe lifts the needy from the garbage heap\nTo seat them with nobles,\nAnd He gives them a seat of honor as an inheritance;\nFor the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s,\nAnd He set the world on them.",
      "9": "He watches over the feet of His godly ones,\nBut the wicked ones are silenced in darkness;\nFor not by might shall a person prevail.",
      "10": "Those who contend with the Lord will be terrified;\nAgainst them He will thunder in the heavens,\nThe Lord will judge the ends of the earth;\nAnd He will give strength to His king,\nAnd will exalt the horn of His anointed.”",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy continued to attend to the service of the Lord before Eli the priest.",
      "12": "Now the sons of Eli were useless men; they did not know the Lord.",
      "13": "And this was the custom of the priests with the people: when anyone was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was cooking, with a three-pronged fork in his hand.",
      "14": "And he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; everything that the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. They did so in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.",
      "15": "Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take cooked meat from you, only raw.”",
      "16": "And if the man said to him, “They must burn the fat first, then take as much as you desire,” then he would say, “No, but you must give it to me now; and if not, I am taking it by force!”",
      "17": "And so the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for the men treated the offering of the Lord disrespectfully.",
      "18": "Now Samuel was ministering before the Lord, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.",
      "19": "And his mother would make for him a little robe and bring it up to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.",
      "20": "Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the Lord give you children from this woman in place of the one she requested of the Lord.” And they went to their own home.",
      "21": "The Lord indeed visited Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up before the Lord.",
      "22": "Now Eli was very old; and he heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they slept with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "So he said to them, “Why are you doing such things as these, the evil things that I hear from all these people?",
      "24": "No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the Lord’s people circulating.",
      "25": "If one person sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a person sins against the Lord, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the Lord desired to put them to death.",
      "26": "Now the boy Samuel was continuing to grow and to be in favor both with the Lord and with people.",
      "27": "Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Did I not indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?",
      "28": "Did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel?",
      "29": "Why are you showing contempt for My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded for My dwelling, and why are you honoring your sons above Me, by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel?’",
      "30": "Therefore the Lord God of Israel declares, ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father was to walk before Me forever’; but now the Lord declares, ‘Far be it from Me—for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be insignificant.",
      "31": "Behold, the days are coming when I will eliminate your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.",
      "32": "And you will look at the distress of My dwelling, in spite of all the good that I do for Israel; and there will never be an old man in your house.",
      "33": "Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar, so that your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul grieve, and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life.",
      "34": "And this will be the sign to you which will come in regard to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them will die.",
      "35": "But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always.",
      "36": "And everyone who is left in your house will come to bow down to him for a silver coin or a loaf of bread and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the Lord before Eli. And word from the Lord was rare in those days; visions were infrequent.",
      "2": "But it happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to be poor and he could not see well),",
      "3": "and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was,",
      "4": "that the Lord called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”",
      "5": "Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.",
      "6": "And the Lord called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son, go back and lie down.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "So the Lord called Samuel again for the third time. And he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.",
      "9": "And Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "Then the Lord came and stood, and called as at the other times: “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to Samuel, “Behold, I am going to do a thing in Israel, and both ears of everyone who hears about it will ring.",
      "12": "On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I have spoken in regard to his house, from beginning to end.",
      "13": "For I have told him that I am going to judge his house forever for the wrongdoing that he knew, because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.",
      "14": "Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the wrongdoing of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.”",
      "15": "So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.",
      "16": "Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”",
      "17": "He said, “What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more so, if you hide a single word from me of all the words that He spoke to you!”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “He is the Lord; let Him do what seems good to Him.”",
      "19": "Now Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and He let none of his words fail.",
      "20": "And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lord.",
      "21": "And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh, because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "So the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle, and they camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped in Aphek.",
      "2": "Then the Philistines drew up in battle formation to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.",
      "3": "When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s take the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Shiloh, so that He may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”",
      "4": "So the people sent men to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord of armies who is enthroned above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
      "5": "And as the ark of the covenant of the Lord was coming into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.",
      "6": "And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp.",
      "7": "So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.",
      "8": "Woe to us! Who will save us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.",
      "9": "Take courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; so be men and fight!”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the defeat was very great, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.",
      "11": "Moreover, the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and dust on his head.",
      "13": "When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road keeping watch, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. And the man came to give a report in the city, and all the city cried out.",
      "14": "When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What does the noise of this commotion mean?” Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli.",
      "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed and he could not see.",
      "16": "The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” And he said, “How are things, my son?”",
      "17": "Then the one who brought the news replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great defeat among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas are also dead; and the ark of God has been taken.”",
      "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. And so he judged Israel for forty years.",
      "19": "Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, because her pains came upon her.",
      "20": "And about the time of her death the women who were standing by her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention.",
      "21": "And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God had been taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",
      "22": "So she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been taken.”"

    "5": {
      "1": "Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.",
      "2": "Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon.",
      "3": "When the Ashdodites got up early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.",
      "4": "But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. And the head of Dagon and both palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the torso of Dagon was left.",
      "5": "For that reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.",
      "6": "Now the hand of the Lord was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He made them feel devastated and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories.",
      "7": "When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.”",
      "8": "So they sent word and gathered all the governors of the Philistines to them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Have the ark of the God of Israel brought to Gath.” So they took the ark of the God of Israel away.",
      "9": "After they had taken it away, the hand of the Lord was against the city, creating a very great panic; and He struck the people of the city, from the young to the old, so that tumors broke out on them.",
      "10": "So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!”",
      "11": "Therefore they sent word and gathered all the governors of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people!” For there was a deadly panic throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.",
      "12": "And the people who did not die were struck with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Now the ark of the Lord had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months.",
      "2": "And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What are we to do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we may send it to its place.”",
      "3": "And they said, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel away, do not send it empty; but you shall certainly return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be revealed to you why His hand does not leave you.”",
      "4": "Then they said, “What is to be the guilt offering that we shall return to Him?” And they said, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice corresponding to the number of the governors of the Philistines, since one plague was on all of you and on your governors.",
      "5": "So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that are ruining the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, your gods, and your land.",
      "6": "Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not let the people go, and they left?",
      "7": "Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves back home, away from them.",
      "8": "Then take the ark of the Lord and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a guilt offering in a saddlebag by its side. Then send it away that it may go.",
      "9": "But watch: if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done this great evil to us. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance.”",
      "10": "Then the men did so: they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut in their calves at home.",
      "11": "And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the saddlebag with the gold mice and the likenesses of their tumors.",
      "12": "Now the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went on the same road, bellowing as they went, and did not turn off to the right or to the left. And the governors of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.",
      "13": "Now the people of Beth-shemesh were gathering in their wheat harvest in the valley, and they raised their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced at seeing it.",
      "14": "And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stopped there where there was a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.",
      "15": "And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the saddlebag that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the Lord.",
      "16": "When the five governors of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day.",
      "17": "Now these are the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron;",
      "18": "and the gold mice, corresponding to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five governors, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large stone on which they placed the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.",
      "19": "Now He fatally struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the Lord. He struck 50,070 men among the people, and the people mourned because the Lord had struck the people with a great slaughter.",
      "20": "And the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? And to whom will He go up from us?”",
      "21": "So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord; come down and take it up to yourselves.”"

      "1": "And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to watch over the ark of the Lord.",
      "2": "From the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim, the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel mourned after the Lord.",
      "3": "Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to the Lord and serve Him alone; and He will save you from the hand of the Philistines.”",
      "4": "So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served the Lord alone.",
      "5": "Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the Lord for you.”",
      "6": "So they gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against the Lord.” And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah.",

      "9": "Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord; and Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him.",
      "10": "Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines advanced to battle Israel. But the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were struck down before Israel.",
      "11": "And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and killed them as far as below Beth-car.",
      "12": "Then Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, “So far the Lord has helped us.”",
      "13": "So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.",
      "14": "The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.",

      "13": "Then David said to his men, “Each of you strap on his sword.” So each man strapped on his sword. And David also strapped on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David, while two hundred stayed with the baggage.",

      "33": "and blessed be your discernment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.",
      "34": "Nevertheless, as the Lord God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, there certainly would not have been left to Nabal until the morning light as much as one male.”",
      "35": "So David accepted from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request.”",
      "36": "Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was having a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was cheerful within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light.",

The Lord has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife.",

      "6": "Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”",

If the Lord has incited you against me, may He accept an offering; but if it is people, cursed are they before the Lord, because they have driven me out today so that I would have no share in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’",
