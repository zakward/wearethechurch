      "3": "Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place which was at Gibeon, because God’s tent of meeting was there which Moses, the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.",
      "4": "However, David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.",

      "9": "Now, Lord God, Your promise to my father David is fulfilled, for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.",
      "10": "Now give me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?”",

      "12": "wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. I will also give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed, nor will those who will come after you.”",
