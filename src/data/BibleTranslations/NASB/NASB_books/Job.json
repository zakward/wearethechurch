  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east.",
      "4": "His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send word and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send word to them and consecrate them, getting up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.",
      "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "8": "The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.”",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing?",
      "10": "Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.",
      "11": "But reach out with Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will certainly curse You to Your face.”",
      "12": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not reach out and put your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "14": "a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys feeding beside them,",
      "15": "and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "16": "While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "17": "While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three units and made a raid on the camels and took them, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "18": "While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "19": "and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "20": "Then Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; then he fell to the ground and worshiped.",
      "21": "He said,\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I shall return there.\nThe Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.\nBlessed be the name of the Lord.”",
      "22": "Despite all this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again, there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord.",
      "2": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "3": "The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds firm to his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”",
      "4": "Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has, he will give for his life.",
      "5": "However, reach out with Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face!”",
      "6": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.”",
      "7": "Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.",
      "8": "And Job took a piece of pottery to scrape himself while he was sitting in the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold firm your integrity? Curse God and die!”",
      "10": "But he said to her, “You are speaking as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we actually accept good from God but not accept adversity?” Despite all this, Job did not sin with his lips.",
      "11": "Now when Job’s three friends heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, they came, each one from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him.",
      "12": "When they looked from a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky.",
      "13": "Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.",
      "2": "And Job said,",
      "3": "“May the day on which I was to be born perish,\nAs well as the night which said, ‘A boy is conceived.’",
      "4": "May that day be darkness;\nMay God above not care for it,\nNor light shine on it.",
      "5": "May darkness and black gloom claim it;\nMay a cloud settle on it;\nMay the blackness of the day terrify it.",
      "6": "As for that night, may darkness seize it;\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nMay it not come into the number of the months.",
      "7": "Behold, may that night be barren;\nMay no joyful shout enter it.",
      "8": "May those curse it who curse the day,\nWho are prepared to disturb Leviathan.",
      "9": "May the stars of its twilight be darkened;\nMay it wait for light but have none,\nAnd may it not see the breaking dawn;",
      "10": "Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb,\nOr hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "“Why did I not die at birth,\nCome out of the womb and pass away?",
      "12": "Why were the knees there in front of me,\nAnd why the breasts, that I would nurse?",
      "13": "For now I would have lain down and been quiet;\nI would have slept then, I would have been at rest,",
      "14": "With kings and counselors of the earth,\nWho rebuilt ruins for themselves;",
      "15": "Or with rulers who had gold,\nWho were filling their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Or like a miscarriage which is hidden, I would not exist,\nAs infants that never saw light.",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from raging,\nAnd there the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "The prisoners are at ease together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.",
      "19": "The small and the great are there,\nAnd the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "“Why is light given to one burdened with grief,\nAnd life to the bitter of soul,",
      "21": "Who long for death, but there is none,\nAnd dig for it more than for hidden treasures;",
      "22": "Who are filled with jubilation,\nAnd rejoice when they find the grave?",
      "23": "Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\nAnd whom God has shut off?",
      "24": "For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,\nAnd my cries pour out like water.",
      "25": "For what I fear comes upon me,\nAnd what I dread encounters me.",
      "26": "I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,\nAnd I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,",
      "2": "“If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient?\nBut who can refrain from speaking?",
      "3": "Behold, you have taught many,\nAnd you have strengthened weak hands.",
      "4": "Your words have helped the stumbling to stand,\nAnd you have strengthened feeble knees.",
      "5": "But now it comes to you, and you are impatient;\nIt touches you, and you are horrified.",
      "6": "Is your fear of God not your confidence,\nAnd the integrity of your ways your hope?",
      "7": "“Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?\nOr where were the upright destroyed?",
      "8": "According to what I have seen, those who plow wrongdoing\nAnd those who sow trouble harvest it.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish,\nAnd by the blast of His anger they come to an end.",
      "10": "The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion,\nAnd the teeth of the young lions are broken out.",
      "11": "The lion perishes for lack of prey,\nAnd the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "“Now a word was brought to me secretly,\nAnd my ear received a whisper of it.",
      "13": "Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night,\nWhen deep sleep falls on people,",
      "14": "Dread came upon me, and trembling,\nAnd made all my bones shake.",
      "15": "Then a spirit passed by my face;\nThe hair of my flesh stood up.",
      "16": "Something was standing still, but I could not recognize its appearance;\nA form was before my eyes;\nThere was silence, then I heard a voice:",
      "17": "‘Can mankind be righteous before God?\nCan a man be pure before his Maker?",
      "18": "He puts no trust even in His servants;\nAnd He accuses His angels of error.",
      "19": "How much more those who live in houses of clay,\nWhose foundation is in the dust,\nWho are crushed before the moth!",
      "20": "Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces;\nUnregarded, they perish forever.",
      "21": "Is their tent-cord not pulled out within them?\nThey die, yet without wisdom.’"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "“Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?\nAnd to which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "For irritation kills the fool,\nAnd jealousy brings death to the simple.",
      "3": "I have seen the fool taking root,\nAnd I cursed his home immediately.",
      "4": "His sons are far from safety,\nThey are also oppressed at the gate,\nAnd there is no one to save them.",
      "5": "The hungry devour his harvest\nAnd take it to a place of thorns,\nAnd the schemer is eager for their wealth.",
      "6": "For disaster does not come from the dust,\nNor does trouble sprout from the ground,",
      "7": "For man is born for trouble,\nAs sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "“But as for me, I would seek God,\nAnd I would make my plea before God,",
      "9": "Who does great and unsearchable things,\nWonders without number.",
      "10": "He gives rain on the earth,\nAnd sends water on the fields,",
      "11": "So that He sets on high those who are lowly,\nAnd those who mourn are lifted to safety.",
      "12": "He frustrates the schemes of the shrewd,\nSo that their hands cannot attain success.",
      "13": "He captures the wise by their own cleverness,\nAnd the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted.",
      "14": "By day they meet with darkness,\nAnd grope at noon as in the night.",
      "15": "But He saves from the sword of their mouth,\nAnd the poor from the hand of the strong.",
      "16": "So the helpless has hope,\nAnd injustice has shut its mouth.",
      "17": "“Behold, happy is the person whom God disciplines,\nSo do not reject the discipline of the Almighty.",
      "18": "For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;\nHe wounds, but His hands also heal.",
      "19": "In six troubles He will save you;\nEven in seven, evil will not touch you.",
      "20": "In famine He will redeem you from death,\nAnd in war, from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,\nAnd you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.",
      "22": "You will laugh at violence and hunger,\nAnd you will not be afraid of wild animals.",
      "23": "For you will be in league with the stones of the field,\nAnd the animals of the field will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "You will know that your tent is secure,\nFor you will visit your home and have nothing missing.",
      "25": "You will also know that your descendants will be many,\nAnd your offspring as the grass of the earth.",
      "26": "You will come to the grave at a ripe age,\nLike the stacking of grain in its season.",

      "3": "For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;\nFor that reason my words have been rash.",
