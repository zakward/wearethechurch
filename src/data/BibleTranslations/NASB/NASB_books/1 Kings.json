      "3": "So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king did not become intimate with her.",
      "5": "Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, with fifty men to run before him.",
      "6": "And his father had never rebuked him at any time by asking, “Why have you done so?” And he was also a very handsome man, and he was born after Absalom.",
      "7": "Now he had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and they allied themselves with Adonijah.",
      "8": "But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.",
      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened steers by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.",
      "10": "But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?",
      "12": "So now come, please let me give you advice, and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, saying, “Solomon your son certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’",
      "14": "Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”",
      "15": "So Bathsheba entered to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.",
      "16": "Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, “What is on your mind?”",
      "17": "So she said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to your servant by the Lord your God, saying, ‘Your son Solomon certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’",
      "18": "But now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know it.",
      "19": "He has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.",
      "20": "And as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to announce to them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.",
      "21": "Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king lies down with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.”",
      "22": "And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",
      "23": "They informed the king, saying, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And when he came into the king’s presence, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.",
      "24": "Then Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you yourself said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?",
      "25": "For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking in his presence; and they say, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "But me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not invited.",
      "27": "Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”",
      "28": "Then King David responded and said, “Summon Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.",
      "29": "Then the king vowed and said, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,",
      "30": "certainly as I vowed to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Your son Solomon certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place’; I will indeed do so this day.”",
      "31": "Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever.”",
      "32": "Then King David said, “Summon to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” And they came into the king’s presence.",
      "33": "And the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.",
      "34": "And have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "35": "Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”",
      "36": "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say the same.",
      "37": "Just as the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!”",
      "38": "So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.",
      "39": "And Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "40": "And all the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise.",
      "41": "Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard this as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is the city making such an uproar?”",
      "42": "While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a valiant man and you bring good news.”",
      "43": "But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, “On the contrary! Our lord King David has made Solomon king!",
      "44": "The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have mounted him on the king’s mule.",
      "45": "Furthermore, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is going wild. This is the noise which you have heard.",
      "46": "Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom.",
      "47": "Moreover, the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne!’ And the king bowed himself on the bed.",
      "48": "The king has also said this: ‘Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne today while my own eyes see it.’”",
      "49": "Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and got up, and each went on his way.",
      "50": "Adonijah also was afraid of Solomon, and he got up, and went, and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "Now it was reported to Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘May King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”",
      "52": "And Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.”",
      "53": "So King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”"

      "1": "As David’s time to die drew near, he commanded his son Solomon, saying,",
      "2": "“I am going the way of all the earth. So be strong, and prove yourself a man.",
      "3": "Do your duty to the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, so that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,",
      "4": "so that the Lord may fulfill His promise which He spoke regarding me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful about their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and all their soul, you shall not be deprived of a man to occupy the throne of Israel.’",
      "5": "“Now you yourself also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed; he also shed the blood of war in peace. And he put the blood of war on his belt that was on his waist, and on his sandals that were on his feet.",
      "6": "So act as your wisdom dictates, and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace.",
      "7": "However, show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother.",
      "8": "And behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjaminite, of Bahurim; now it was he who cursed me with a painful curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’",
      "9": "But now do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what to do to him, and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.”",
      "10": "Then David lay down with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David.",
      "11": "Now the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: in Hebron he reigned for seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years.",
      "12": "Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.",
      "13": "Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. So she said, “Do you come peacefully?” And he said, “Peacefully.”",
      "14": "Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” And she said, “Speak.”",
      "15": "So he said, “You yourself know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel intended for me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned around and become my brother’s, for it was his from the Lord.",
      "16": "So now I am making one request of you; do not refuse me.” And she said to him, “Speak.”",
      "17": "Then he said, “Please speak to Solomon the king—for he will not refuse you—that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”",
      "18": "And Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”",
      "19": "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king stood to meet her, bowed to her, and sat on his throne; then he had a throne set up for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right.",
      "20": "Then she said, “I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”",
      "21": "So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife.”",
      "22": "But King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “And why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Request for him the kingdom as well—since he is my older brother—for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!”",
      "23": "Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, “May God do so to me and more so, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life!",
      "24": "Now then, as the Lord lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father, and has made me a house just as He promised, Adonijah certainly shall be put to death today!”",
      "25": "Then King Solomon sent the order by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him so that he died.",
      "26": "Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth to your own field, for you deserve to die; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David, and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted.”",
      "27": "So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, to fulfill the word of the Lord, which He had spoken regarding the house of Eli in Shiloh.",
      "28": "Now the news came to Joab because Joab had followed Adonijah, though he had not followed Absalom. So Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "29": "And it was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord, and was beside the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, execute him.”",
      "30": "So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him, “This is what the king has said: ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, for I will die here.” So Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, “This is what Joab spoke, and so he answered me.”",
      "31": "And the king said to him, “Do just as he has spoken, and execute him and bury him, so that you may remove from me and from my father’s house the blood which Joab shed without justification.",
      "32": "The Lord will return his blood on his own head, because he struck two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, while my father David did not know about it: Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.",
      "33": "So their blood shall return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but for David and his descendants, and his house and his throne, may there be peace from the Lord forever.”",
      "34": "Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.",
      "35": "And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.",
      "36": "Now the king sent men and summoned Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not leave there for any other place.",
      "37": "For on the day you leave and cross the brook Kidron, you will know for certain that you will assuredly die; your blood will be on your own head.”",
      "38": "Shimei then said to the king, “The word is good. Just as my lord the king has spoken, so your servant shall do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.",
      "39": "But it came about at the end of three years, that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And others told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.”",
      "40": "Then Shimei got up and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to search for his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.",
      "41": "And it was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.",
      "42": "So the king sent men and summoned Shimei, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the Lord, and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere, you shall assuredly die’? And you said to me, ‘The word I have heard is good.’",
      "43": "Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord, and the command which I imposed on you?”",
      "44": "The king also said to Shimei, “You yourself know all the evil that you acknowledge in your heart, which you did to my father David; therefore the Lord will return your evil on your own head.",

      "2": "The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days.",
      "3": "Now Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he was sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.",
      "4": "And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, because that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.",
      "5": "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, “Ask what you wish Me to give you.”",
      "6": "Then Solomon said, “You have shown great faithfulness to Your servant David my father, according as he walked before You in truth, righteousness, and uprightness of heart toward You; and You have reserved for him this great faithfulness, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.",
      "7": "And now, Lord my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am like a little boy; I do not know how to go out or come in.",
      "8": "And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted.",
      "9": "So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is capable of judging this great people of Yours?”",
      "10": "Now it was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.",
      "11": "And God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself a long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice,",
      "12": "behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.",
      "13": "I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days.",
      "14": "And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.”",

      "18": "And it happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house.",

      "34": "And Ben-hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you can make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” Ahab said, “And I will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.",
      "35": "Now a man from the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the Lord, “Please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him.",
