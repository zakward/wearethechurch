      "2": "To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.",
      "3": "Just as I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, to remain on at Ephesus so that you would instruct certain people not to teach strange doctrines,",
      "4": "nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation rather than advance the plan of God, which is by faith, so I urge you now.",
      "5": "But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from a sincere faith.",
      "6": "Some people have strayed from these things and have turned aside to fruitless discussion,",
      "7": "wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.",
      "8": "But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,",
      "9": "realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and worldly, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,",
      "10": "for the sexually immoral, homosexuals, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,",
      "11": "according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.",
      "12": "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service,",
      "13": "even though I was previously a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;",
      "14": "and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost.",
      "16": "Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost sinner Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.",
      "17": "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.",
      "18": "This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight,",
      "19": "keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.",
      "20": "Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme."

      "2": "for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.",
      "3": "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,",
      "4": "who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
      "5": "For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus,",

      "7": "For this I was appointed as a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.",
      "8": "Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and dispute.",
      "9": "Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive apparel,",
      "10": "but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.",
      "11": "A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.",
      "12": "But I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.",
      "13": "For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.",
      "14": "And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a wrongdoer.",

      "3": "not overindulging in wine, not a bully, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money.",
      "4": "He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity",

      "6": "and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into condemnation incurred by the devil.",
      "7": "And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil.",
      "8": "Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not insincere, not prone to drink much wine, not greedy for money,",
      "9": "but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.",
      "10": "These men must also first be tested; then have them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.",
      "11": "Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.",
      "12": "Deacons must be husbands of one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households.",
      "13": "For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;",
      "15": "but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one should act in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.",
      "16": "Beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness:\nHe who was revealed in the flesh,\nWas vindicated in the Spirit,\nSeen by angels,\nProclaimed among the nations,\nBelieved on in the world,\nTaken up in glory."

      "3": "who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.",
      "4": "For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;",
      "5": "for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.",
      "6": "In pointing out these things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have been following.",
      "7": "But stay away from worthless stories that are typical of old women. Rather, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness;",
      "8": "for bodily training is just slightly beneficial, but godliness is beneficial for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.",
      "9": "It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.",
      "10": "For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all mankind, especially of believers.",
      "11": "Prescribe and teach these things.",
      "12": "Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.",

      "14": "Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was granted to you through words of prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.",
      "15": "Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.",

      "3": "Honor widows who are actually widows;",
      "4": "but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to show proper respect for their own family and to give back compensation to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.",
      "5": "Now she who is actually a widow and has been left alone has set her hope on God, and she continues in requests and prayers night and day.",
      "6": "But she who indulges herself in luxury is dead, even while she lives.",
      "7": "Give these instructions as well, so that they may be above reproach.",
      "8": "But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.",

      "11": "But refuse to register younger widows, for when they feel physical desires alienating them from Christ, they want to get married,",
      "12": "thereby incurring condemnation, because they have ignored their previous pledge.",
      "13": "At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also they become gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention.",
      "14": "Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, have children, manage their households, and give the enemy no opportunity for reproach;",
      "15": "for some have already turned away to follow Satan.",
      "16": "If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are actually widows.",
      "17": "The elders who lead well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.",
      "18": "For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing,” and “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”",
      "19": "Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.",
      "20": "Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning.",
      "21": "I solemnly exhort you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.",
      "22": "Do not lay hands upon anyone too quickly and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.",
      "23": "Do not go on drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.",
      "24": "The sins of some people are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after.",
      "25": "Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed."

      "1": "All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.",
      "2": "Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers or sisters, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles.",
      "3": "If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness,",
      "4": "he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a sick craving for controversial questions and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,",
      "5": "and constant friction between people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.",
      "6": "But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.",
      "7": "For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either.",
      "8": "If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.",
      "9": "But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction.",
      "10": "For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.",
      "11": "But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.",
      "12": "Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.",
      "13": "I direct you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,",

      "19": "storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.",
      "20": "Timothy, protect what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly, empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called “knowledge”—",
