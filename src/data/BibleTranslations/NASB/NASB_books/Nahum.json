      "11": "From you has gone out\nOne who plotted evil against the Lord,\nA wicked counselor.",
      "12": "This is what the Lord says:\n“Though they are at full strength and so they are many,\nSo also they will be cut off and pass away.\nThough I have afflicted you,\nI will afflict you no longer.",
      "13": "So now, I will break his yoke from upon you,\nAnd I will tear your shackles to pieces.”",
      "14": "The Lord has issued a command concerning you:\n“Your name will no longer be perpetuated.\nI will eliminate the carved image and the cast metal image\nFrom the house of your gods.\nI will prepare your grave,\nFor you are contemptible.”",
      "15": "Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news,\nWho announces peace!\nCelebrate your feasts, Judah,\nPay your vows.\nFor never again will the wicked one pass through you;\nHe is eliminated completely."

      "11": "Where is the den of the lions\nAnd the feeding place of the young lions,\nWhere the lion, lioness, and lion’s cub went\nWith nothing to disturb them?",
      "12": "The lion tore enough for his cubs,\nKilled enough prey for his lionesses,\nAnd filled his lairs with prey\nAnd his dens with torn flesh.",
      "13": "“Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies. “I will burn up her chariots in smoke, and a sword will devour your young lions; I will eliminate your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.”"

      "5": "“Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies;\n“And I will lift up your skirts over your face,\nAnd show the nations your nakedness,\nAnd the kingdoms your shame.",
      "6": "I will throw filth on you\nAnd declare you worthless,\nAnd set you up as a spectacle.",
      "7": "And it will come about that all who see you\nWill shrink from you and say,\n‘Nineveh is devastated!\nWho will have sympathy for her?’\nWhere shall I seek comforters for you?”",
      "8": "Are you better than No-amon,\nWhich was situated by the canals of the Nile,\nWith water surrounding her,\nWhose rampart was the sea,\nWhose wall consisted of the sea?",
      "9": "Ethiopia was her might,\nEgypt too, without limits.\nPut and Lubim were among her helpers.",
      "10": "Yet she became an exile,\nShe went into captivity;\nAlso her small children were smashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for her honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound with shackles.",
      "11": "You too will become drunk,\nYou will be hidden.\nYou too will search for a refuge from the enemy.",
      "12": "All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit—\nWhen shaken, they fall into the eater’s mouth.",
      "13": "Behold, your people are women in your midst!\nThe gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;\nFire consumes your gate bars.",
      "14": "Draw for yourself water for a siege!\nStrengthen your fortifications!\nGo into the clay and tread the mortar!\nTake hold of the brick mold!",
      "15": "There fire will consume you,\nThe sword will cut you down;\nIt will consume you as the creeping locust consumes a crop.\nMultiply yourself like the creeping locust,\nMultiply yourself like the migratory locust.",
      "16": "You have made your traders more numerous than the stars of heaven—\nThe creeping locust sheds its skin and flies away.",
      "17": "Your courtiers are like the migratory locust.\nYour officials are like a swarm of locusts\nSettling in the stone shelters on a cold day.\nThe sun rises and they flee,\nAnd the place where they are is not known.",
      "18": "Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria;\nYour officers are lying down.\nYour people are scattered on the mountains\nAnd there is no one to gather them.",
      "19": "There is no relief for your collapse,\nYour wound is incurable.\nAll who hear about you\nWill clap their hands over you,\nFor upon whom has your evil not come continually?"
