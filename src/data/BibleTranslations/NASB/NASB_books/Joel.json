      "1": "The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:",
      "2": "Hear this, you elders,\nAnd listen, all inhabitants of the land.\nHas anything like this happened in your days,\nOr in your fathers’ days?",
      "3": "Tell your sons about it,\nAnd have your sons tell their sons,\nAnd their sons the next generation.",
      "4": "What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;\nAnd what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten;\nAnd what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.",
      "5": "Awake, you heavy drinkers, and weep;\nAnd wail, all you wine drinkers,\nBecause of the sweet wine,\nFor it has been eliminated from your mouth.",
      "6": "For a nation has invaded my land,\nMighty and without number;\nIts teeth are the teeth of a lion,\nAnd it has the jaws of a lioness.",
      "7": "It has made my vine a waste\nAnd my fig tree a stump.\nIt has stripped them bare and hurled them away;\nTheir branches have become white.",
      "8": "Wail like a virgin clothed with sackcloth\nFor the groom of her youth.",
      "9": "The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off\nFrom the house of the Lord.\nThe priests mourn,\nThe ministers of the Lord.",
      "10": "The field is ruined,\nThe land mourns;\nFor the grain is ruined,\nThe new wine has dried up,\nFresh oil has failed.",
      "11": "Be ashamed, you farm workers,\nWail, you vinedressers,\nFor the wheat and the barley;\nBecause the harvest of the field is destroyed.",
      "12": "The vine has dried up\nAnd the fig tree has withered;\nThe pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree,\nAll the trees of the field have dried up.\nIndeed, joy has dried up\nFrom the sons of mankind.",
      "13": "Put on sackcloth\nAnd mourn, you priests;\nWail, you ministers of the altar!\nCome, spend the night in sackcloth,\nYou ministers of my God,\nFor the grain offering and the drink offering\nHave been withheld from the house of your God.",
      "14": "Consecrate a fast,\nProclaim a solemn assembly;\nGather the elders\nAnd all the inhabitants of the land\nTo the house of the Lord your God,\nAnd cry out to the Lord.",
      "15": "Woe for the day!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\nAnd it will come as destruction from the Almighty.",
      "16": "Has food not been cut off before our eyes, and\nJoy and rejoicing from the house of our God?",
      "17": "The seeds have dried up under their shovels;\nThe storehouses have become desolate,\nThe grain silos are ruined,\nBecause the grain has dried up.",
      "18": "How the animals have groaned!\nThe herds of cattle have wandered aimlessly\nBecause there is no pasture for them;\nEven the flocks of sheep have suffered.",
      "19": "To You, Lord, I cry out;\nFor fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,\nAnd the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.",
      "20": "Even the animals of the field pant for You;\nFor the stream beds of water are dried up,\nAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."

      "1": "Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nAnd sound an alarm on My holy mountain!\nLet all the inhabitants of the land tremble,\nFor the day of the Lord is coming;\nIndeed, it is near,",
      "2": "A day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness.\nAs dawn is spread over the mountains,\nSo there is a great and mighty people;\nThere has never been anything like it,\nNor will there be again after it\nTo the years of many generations.",
      "3": "A fire consumes before them,\nAnd behind them a flame devours.\nThe land is like the Garden of Eden before them,\nBut a desolate wilderness behind them,\nAnd nothing at all escapes them.",
      "4": "Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;\nAnd like war horses, so they run.",
      "5": "With a noise as of chariots\nThey leap about on the tops of the mountains,\nLike the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble,\nLike a mighty people drawn up for battle.",
      "6": "Before them the people are in anguish;\nAll faces turn pale.",
      "7": "They run like warriors,\nThey climb the wall like soldiers;\nAnd each of them marches in line,\nNor do they lose their way.",
      "8": "They do not crowd each other,\nEvery warrior of them marches in his path;\nWhen they burst through the defenses,\nThey do not break ranks.",
      "9": "They storm the city,\nThey run on the wall;\nThey climb into the houses,\nThey enter through the windows like a thief.",
      "10": "Before them the earth quakes,\nThe heavens tremble,\nThe sun and the moon become dark,\nAnd the stars lose their brightness.",
      "11": "The Lord utters His voice before His army;\nHis camp is indeed very great,\nFor mighty is one who carries out His word.\nThe day of the Lord is indeed great and very awesome,\nAnd who can endure it?",
      "12": "“Yet even now,” declares the Lord,\n“Return to Me with all your heart,\nAnd with fasting, weeping, and mourning;",
      "13": "And tear your heart and not merely your garments.”\nNow return to the Lord your God,\nFor He is gracious and compassionate,\nSlow to anger, abounding in mercy\nAnd relenting of catastrophe.",
      "14": "Who knows, He might turn and relent,\nAnd leave a blessing behind Him,\nResulting in a grain offering and a drink offering\nFor the Lord your God.",
      "15": "Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nConsecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,",
      "16": "Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,\nAssemble the elders,\nGather the children and the nursing infants.\nHave the groom come out of his room\nAnd the bride out of her bridal chamber.",
      "17": "Let the priests, the Lord’s ministers,\nWeep between the porch and the altar,\nAnd let them say, “Spare Your people, Lord,\nAnd do not make Your inheritance a disgrace,\nWith the nations jeering at them.\nWhy should those among the peoples say,\n‘Where is their God?’”",
      "18": "Then the Lord will be zealous for His land,\nAnd will have compassion for His people.",
      "19": "The Lord will answer and say to His people,\n“Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine, and oil,\nAnd you will be satisfied in full with them;\nAnd I will never again make you a disgrace among the nations.",
      "20": "But I will remove the northern army far from you,\nAnd I will drive it into a dry and desolate land,\nIts advance guard into the eastern sea,\nAnd its rear guard into the western sea.\nAnd its stench will ascend and its odor of decay will come up,\nBecause it has done great things.”",
      "21": "Do not fear, land; shout for joy and rejoice,\nFor the Lord has done great things.",
      "22": "Do not fear, animals of the field,\nFor the pastures of the wilderness have turned green,\nFor the tree has produced its fruit,\nThe fig tree and the vine have yielded in full.",
      "23": "So shout for joy, you sons of Zion,\nAnd rejoice in the Lord your God;\nFor He has given you the early rain for your vindication.\nAnd He has brought down for you the rain,\nThe early and latter rain as before.",
      "24": "The threshing floors will be full of grain,\nAnd the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil.",
      "25": "“Then I will compensate you for the years\nThat the swarming locust has eaten,\nThe creeping locust, the stripping locust, and the gnawing locust—\nMy great army which I sent among you.",
      "26": "You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,\nAnd you will praise the name of the Lord your God,\nWho has dealt wondrously with you;\nThen My people will never be put to shame.",
      "27": "So you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,\nAnd that I am the Lord your God\nAnd there is no other;\nAnd My people will never be put to shame.",
      "28": "“It will come about after this\nThat I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;\nAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nYour old men will have dreams,\nYour young men will see visions.",
      "29": "And even on the male and female servants\nI will pour out My Spirit in those days.",
      "30": "I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,\nBlood, fire, and columns of smoke.",
      "31": "The sun will be turned into darkness,\nAnd the moon into blood,\nBefore the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.",
      "32": "And it will come about that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\nWill be saved;\nFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\nThere will be those who escape,\nJust as the Lord has said,\nEven among the survivors whom the Lord calls."

      "3": "They have also cast lots for My people,\nTraded a boy for a prostitute,\nAnd sold a girl for wine so that they may drink.",
      "4": "Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me with retribution? But if you are showing Me retribution, swiftly and speedily I will return your retribution on your head!",

      "18": "And on that day\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,\nAnd the hills will flow with milk,\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;\nAnd a spring will go out from the house of the Lord\nAnd water the Valley of Shittim.",
      "19": "Egypt will become a wasteland,\nAnd Edom will become a desolate wilderness,\nBecause of the violence done to the sons of Judah,\nIn whose land they have shed innocent blood.",
