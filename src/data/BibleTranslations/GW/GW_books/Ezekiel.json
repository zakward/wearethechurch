      "3": "the Lord spoke his word to the priest Ezekiel, son of Buzi, in Babylon by the Chebar River. The power of the Lord came over Ezekiel.",
      "4": "As I looked, I saw a storm coming from the north. There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light. The middle of the lightning looked like glowing metal.",
      "5": "In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like humans,",

      "7": "Their legs were straight, their feet were like those of calves, and they glittered like polished bronze.",

      "19": "But suppose you warn the wicked people, and they don’t turn from their wicked ways. Then they will die because of their sin, but you will save yourself.",
      "20": "If righteous people turn from living the right way and do wrong, I will make them stumble, and they will die. If you don’t warn them, they will die because of their sin, and the right things they did will not be remembered. I will hold you responsible for their deaths.",
      "21": "But if you warn righteous people not to sin, and they don’t sin, they will certainly live because they listened to the warning. You will save yourself.”",
      "22": "The power of the Lord came over me. He said, “Get up, and go to the plain. I will speak to you there.”",

      "3": "With a measuring line in his hand, the man went eastward. He measured off 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my ankles.",
      "4": "Then he measured off another 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my knees. He measured off another 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my waist.",
      "5": "Then he measured another 1,500 feet. But the water had risen so much that it became a river which I couldn’t cross. The river was too deep to cross except by swimming.",
      "6": "Then he asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?”",
      "7": "Then the man led me back along the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw many trees on both sides of the river.",
      "8": "Then the man said to me, “This water flows through the land to the east, down into the Jordan Valley, and into the Dead Sea. When the water flows into the Dead Sea, it will replace the salt water there with fresh water.",
      "9": "Wherever the river flows, there will be many fish and animals. The river will make the water in the Dead Sea fresh. Wherever the river flows, it will bring life.",
      "10": "From En Gedi to En Eglaim people will be standing on the shore of the sea with their fishing nets spread out. As many kinds of fish will be there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "11": "But the water in the swamps and marshes won’t become fresh. It will remain salty.",
      "12": "All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves won’t wither, and they won’t fail to produce fruit. Each month they will produce fresh fruit because this water flows from the holy place. The fruit will be good food, and the leaves will be used for healing.”",
      "13": "This is what the Almighty Lord says: These are the borders of the land that is to be divided among the 12 tribes of Israel. Joseph gets two parts.",
      "14": "Divide the land equally. I raised my hand and swore that I would give the land to your ancestors. So this land will be your inheritance.",
      "15": "This is the northern border for the land: On the north side the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to Hethlon and Hamath Pass. It will run through the city of Zedad and through",
      "16": "Berothah and Sibraim, which are between the borders of Damascus and Hamath. It will run to Hazer Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.",
      "17": "So the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar Enon on the border of Damascus. The border of Hamath will lie to the north. This is the north side.",
      "18": "On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus. The Jordan River will serve as the border between Gilead and the land of Israel. The border will continue from the Dead Sea down to Tamar. This is the east side.",
      "19": "On the south side the border will run from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh along the ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the southern border.",
      "20": "On the west side the Mediterranean Sea is the border up to a point opposite Hamath Pass. This is the west side.",
      "21": "Divide this land among yourselves for each of the tribes of Israel.",
      "22": "Divide it by drawing lots. This land will be for you. It will also be for the foreign residents who live among you and have given birth to children while they lived with you. Think of them as Israelites. They will draw lots with you for their inheritance among the tribes of Israel.",
      "23": "Foreign residents will receive their share of the inheritance with the people of the tribe among whom they are living, declares the Almighty Lord."

This land will extend eastward from the holy area to the eastern border, and it will extend westward to the western border. Both of these areas are as long as one of the sections of the tribes. These areas belong to the prince, and the holy area with the holy place of the temple will be between them.",
      "22": "So the Levites’ property and the city’s property will be between the prince’s part of the land. What is between Judah’s and Benjamin’s boundaries will belong to the prince.",
