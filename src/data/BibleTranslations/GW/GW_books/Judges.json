  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "After Joshua’s death the Israelites asked the Lord, “Who will go first to fight the Canaanites for us?”",
      "2": "The Lord answered, “Judah’s troops will go first. I am about to hand the Canaanites over to you.”",
      "3": "The tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, “Come with us into the territory given to us when we drew lots, and together we will fight the people of Canaan. Then we’ll go with you into your territory.” So the tribe of Simeon went along with Judah.",
      "4": "Judah’s troops went into battle, and the Lord handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They defeated 10,000 men at Bezek.",
      "5": "At Bezek they also caught up with Adoni Bezek. They fought him and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites.",
      "6": "Adoni Bezek fled. Judah’s troops chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni Bezek said, “Seventy kings who had their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up food under my table. God has paid me back for what I did to them.” Judah’s troops brought Adoni Bezek to Jerusalem, where he died.",
      "8": "The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed everyone there and set the city on fire.",
      "9": "After that, the men of Judah went to fight the Canaanites who lived in the mountains, the Negev, and the foothills.",
      "10": "Then they went to fight the Canaanites who lived at Hebron. (In the past Hebron was called Kiriath Arba.) There they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "From there Judah’s troops went to fight the people living at Debir. (In the past Debir was called Kiriath Sepher.)",
      "12": "Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife to whoever defeats Kiriath Sepher and captures it.”",
      "13": "Then Othniel, son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.",
      "14": "When she came to Othniel, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”",
      "15": "She answered, “Give me a blessing. Since you’ve given me some dry land, also give me some springs.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.",
      "16": "The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went with the people of Judah from the City of Palms into the desert of Judah. There they lived with the people of Judah in the Negev near Arad.",
      "17": "The tribe of Judah went to fight along with the tribe of Simeon, their close relatives. They defeated the Canaanites who lived in Zephath and claimed it for the Lord by destroying it. So the city was called Hormah [Claimed for Destruction].",
      "18": "Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron with their territories.",
      "19": "The Lord was with the men of Judah so that they were able to take possession of the mountains. But they could not force out the people living in the valley who had chariots made of iron.",
      "20": "As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who forced out the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "The men of Benjamin did not force out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. The Jebusites still live with the tribe of Benjamin in Jerusalem today.",
      "22": "The descendants of Joseph also went into battle against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "They sent men to spy on Bethel. (In the past the city was called Luz.)",
      "24": "The spies saw a man coming out of the city. They told him, “Show us how we can get into the city, and we’ll treat you kindly.”",
      "25": "He showed them. So they got into the city and killed everyone there. But they let that man and his whole family go free.",
      "26": "The man went to the land of the Hittites. There he built a city and called it Luz. The city still has that name today.",
      "27": "Now, the tribe of Manasseh did not force out the people of Beth Shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo or their villages. The Canaanites were determined to live in this land.",
      "28": "When the Israelites were strong enough, they made the Canaanites do forced labor. But they did not force all of them out.",
      "29": "The tribe of Ephraim did not force out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites continued to live with them in Gezer.",
      "30": "The tribe of Zebulun did not force out those who lived at Kitron or Nahalol. So the Canaanites continued to live with them and were made to do forced labor.",
      "31": "The tribe of Asher did not force out those who lived at Acco or Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob.",
      "32": "So the tribe of Asher continued to live with the Canaanites because they did not force them out.",
      "33": "The tribe of Naphtali did not force out those who lived at Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath. So they continued to live with the Canaanites. But the people of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were made to do forced labor.",
      "34": "The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan into the mountains and would not let them come down into the valley.",
      "35": "The Amorites were determined to live at Har Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the tribes of Joseph became stronger, they made the Amorites do forced labor.",
      "36": "The territory of the Amorites extended from the Akrabbim Pass—from Selah northward."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "The Messenger of the Lord went from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I brought you out of Egypt into the land that I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my promise  to you.",
      "2": "You must never make a treaty with the people who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.’ But you didn’t obey me. What do you think you’re doing?",
      "3": "So I have this to say, ‘I will not force them out of your way. They will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will become a trap for you.’ ”",
      "4": "While the Messenger of the Lord was saying this to all the people of Israel, they began to cry loudly.",
      "5": "So they called that place Bochim [Those Who Cry]. They offered sacrifices there to the Lord.",
      "6": "Now, Joshua sent the people of Israel home. So each family went to take possession of the territory they had inherited.",
      "7": "The people served the Lord throughout Joshua’s lifetime and throughout the lifetimes of the leaders who had outlived him and who had seen all the spectacular works the Lord had done for Israel.",
      "8": "The Lord’s servant Joshua, son of Nun, died at the age of 110.",
      "9": "He was buried at Timnath Heres within the territory he had inherited. This was in the mountains of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "That whole generation had joined their ancestors in death. So another generation grew up after them. They had no personal experience with the Lord or with what he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "The people of Israel did what the Lord considered evil. They began to serve other gods—the Baals.",
      "12": "The Israelites abandoned the Lord God of their ancestors, the God who brought them out of Egypt. They followed the other gods of the people around them. They worshiped these gods, and that made the Lord angry.",
      "13": "They abandoned the Lord to serve the god Baal and the goddess Astarte.",
      "14": "So the Lord became angry with the people of Israel. He handed them over to people who robbed them. He also used their enemies around them to defeat them. They could no longer stand up against their enemies.",
      "15": "Whenever the Israelites went to war, the power of the Lord brought disaster on them. This was what the Lord said he would do in an oath. So he made them suffer a great deal.",
      "16": "Then the Lord would send judges  to rescue them from those who robbed them.",
      "17": "But the people wouldn’t listen to the judges. The Israelites chased after other gods as though they were prostitutes and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors who had obeyed the Lord’s commands. They refused to be like their ancestors.",
      "18": "But when the Lord appointed judges for the Israelites, he was with each judge. The Lord rescued them from their enemies as long as that judge was alive. The Lord was moved by the groaning of those who were tormented and oppressed.",
      "19": "But after each judge died, the people went back to their old ways and acted more corruptly than their parents. They followed, served, and worshiped other gods. They never gave up their evil practices and stubborn ways.",
      "20": "The Lord became angry with Israel. He said, “Because the people of this nation have rejected the promise I gave their ancestors and have not obeyed me,",
      "21": "I will no longer force out the nations Joshua left behind when he died.",
      "22": "I will test the people of Israel with these nations to see whether or not they will carefully follow the Lord’s ways as their ancestors did.”",
      "23": "So the Lord let these nations stay. He had not handed them over to Joshua or forced them out quickly."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "These are the nations the Lord left behind to test all the Israelites who had not experienced any war in Canaan.",
      "2": "The Lord left them to teach Israel’s descendants about war, at least those who had known nothing about it in the past.",
      "3": "He left the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon to the border of Hamath.",
      "4": "These nations were left to test the Israelites, to find out if they would obey the commands the Lord had given their ancestors through Moses.",
      "5": "So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.",
      "6": "The Israelites allowed their sons and daughters to marry these people. Israel also served their gods.",
      "7": "The people of Israel did what the Lord considered evil. They forgot the Lord their God and served other gods and goddesses—the Baals and the Asherahs.",
      "8": "The Lord became angry with the people of Israel. He used King Cushan Rishathaim of Aram Naharaim to defeat them. So Israel served Cushan Rishathaim for eight years.",
      "9": "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help. The Lord sent a savior to rescue them. It was Othniel, son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz.",
      "10": "When the Lord’s Spirit came over him, he became the judge of Israel. He went out to war. The Lord handed King Cushan Rishathaim of Aram Naharaim over to him, and Othniel overpowered him.",
      "11": "So there was finally peace in the land for 40 years. Then Othniel, son of Kenaz, died.",
      "12": "Once again, the people of Israel did what the Lord considered evil. So the Lord made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel, because Israel did what the Lord considered evil.",
      "13": "Eglon got the Ammonites and the Amalekites to help him, and they defeated the Israelites and occupied the City of Palms.",
      "14": "The Israelites served King Eglon of Moab for 18 years.",
      "15": "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help. The Lord sent a savior to rescue them. It was Ehud, a left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin. (Ehud was the son of Gera.)\nThe people sent him with their tax payment to King Eglon of Moab.",
      "16": "Ehud made a two-edged dagger for himself. He fastened it to his right side under his clothes.",
      "17": "Then he brought the tax payment to King Eglon. (Eglon was a very fat man.)",
      "18": "When Ehud had finished delivering the payment, he sent back the men who had carried it.",
      "19": "However, Ehud turned around at the stone idols near Gilgal and returned to Eglon. He said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”\nThe king replied, “Keep quiet!” Then all his advisers left the room.",
      "20": "Ehud came up to him as he sat alone in his room on the roof. He said to the king, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his throne,",
      "21": "Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right side, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly.",
      "22": "Even the handle went in after the blade. Eglon’s fat covered the blade because Ehud didn’t pull the dagger out. The blade stuck out in back.",
      "23": "Ehud left the room. (He had closed and locked the doors of the room before he left.)",
      "24": "After Ehud went out, Eglon’s advisers came in. They were surprised that the doors were locked. “He must be using the toilet,” they said.",
      "25": "They waited and waited, but Eglon didn’t open the doors. So they took the key and opened the door. They were shocked to see their ruler lying on the floor, dead.",
      "26": "While they had been waiting, Ehud escaped. He went past the stone idols and escaped to Seirah.",
      "27": "When he arrived there, he blew a ram’s horn in the mountains of Ephraim to summon the troops. So the troops of Israel came down from the mountains with him, and he led them.",
      "28": "He told them, “Follow me! The Lord will hand your enemy Moab over to you.”\nThey followed him and captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River that led to Moab and refused to let anyone cross.",
      "29": "At that time they killed about ten thousand of Moab’s best fighting men. Not one of them escaped.",
      "30": "The power of Moab was crushed by Israel that day. So there was finally peace in the land for 80 years.",
      "31": "After Ehud came Shamgar, son of Anath. He killed 600 Philistines with a sharp stick used for herding oxen. So he, too, rescued Israel."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "After Ehud died, the people of Israel again did what the Lord considered evil.",
      "2": "So the Lord used King Jabin of Canaan, who ruled at Hazor, to defeat them. The commander of King Jabin’s army was Sisera, who lived at Harosheth Haggoyim.",
      "3": "The people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help. King Jabin had 900 chariots made of iron and had cruelly oppressed Israel for 20 years.",
      "4": "Deborah, wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet. She was the judge in Israel at that time.",
      "5": "She used to sit under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The people of Israel would come to her for legal decisions.",
      "6": "Deborah summoned Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali. She told him, “The Lord God of Israel has given you this order: ‘Gather troops on Mount Tabor. Take 10,000 men from Naphtali and Zebulun with you.",
      "7": "I will lead Sisera (the commander of Jabin’s army), his chariots, and troops to you at the Kishon River. I will hand him over to you.’ ”",
      "8": "Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I’ll go. But if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.”",
      "9": "Deborah replied, “Certainly, I’ll go with you. But you won’t win any honors for the way you’re going about this, because the Lord will use a woman to defeat Sisera.”\nSo Deborah started out for Kedesh with Barak.",
      "10": "Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali together at Kedesh. Ten thousand men went to fight under his command. Deborah also went along with him.",
      "11": "Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites (the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ father-in-law). Heber went as far away as the oak tree at Zaanannim near Kedesh and set up his tent.",
      "12": "The report reached Sisera that Barak, son of Abinoam, had come to fight at Mount Tabor.",
      "13": "So Sisera summoned all his chariots (900 chariots made of iron) and all his troops from Harosheth Haggoyim to come to the Kishon River.",
      "14": "Then Deborah said to Barak, “Attack! This is the day the Lord will hand Sisera over to you. The Lord will go ahead of you.”\nSo Barak came down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men behind him.",
      "15": "The Lord threw Sisera, all his chariots, and his whole army into a panic in front of Barak’s deadly assault. Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.",
      "16": "Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth Haggoyim. So Sisera’s whole army was killed in combat. Not one man survived.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Sisera fled on foot toward the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. Sisera did this because King Jabin of Hazor and Heber’s family were on peaceful terms.",
      "18": "When Jael came out of her tent, she met Sisera. She told him, “Sir, come in here! Come into my tent. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she hid him under a tent curtain.",
      "19": "Sisera said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink. I’m thirsty.” But instead she gave him milk to drink and covered him up again.",
      "20": "He said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent. If anyone comes and asks if there has been a man around here, tell them no.”",
      "21": "When Sisera had fallen sound asleep from exhaustion, Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and walked quietly toward him with a hammer in her hand. She hammered the tent peg through his temples into the ground. So Sisera died.",
      "22": "Barak was still pursuing Sisera. When Jael came out of her tent, she met him. She said to him, “Come in! I have something to show you—the man you’ve been looking for.” So Barak went into her tent. He saw Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temples.",
      "23": "So on that day, God used the people of Israel to crush the power of King Jabin of Canaan.",
      "24": "The Israelites became stronger and stronger until they destroyed him."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "On that day Deborah and Barak, son of Abinoam, sang this song:",
      "2": "Praise the Lord!\nMen in Israel vowed to fight,\nand people volunteered for service.",
      "3": "Listen, you kings!\nOpen your ears, you princes!\nI will sing a song to the Lord.\nI will make music to the Lord God of Israel.",
      "4": "O Lord,\nwhen you went out from Seir,\nwhen you marched from the country of Edom,\nthe earth quaked,\nthe sky poured,\nthe clouds burst,",
      "5": "and the mountains shook\nin the presence of the Lord God of Sinai,\nin the presence of the Lord God of Israel.",
      "6": "In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath,\nin the days of Jael,\nroads were deserted.\nThose who traveled took back roads.",
      "7": "Villages in Israel were deserted—\ndeserted until I, Deborah, took a stand—\ntook a stand as a mother of Israel.",
      "8": "When the people chose new gods,\nwar broke out inside the city gates.\nNot a weapon was seen among 40,000 in Israel.",
      "9": "My heart goes out to Israel’s commanders,\nto those people who volunteered.\nPraise the Lord!",
      "10": "You people who ride on brown donkeys,\nwho sit on saddle blankets,\nand who walk on the road—think.",
      "11": "Listen to the voices of those singing at the wells.\nOver and over again they repeat\nthe victories of the Lord,\nthe victories for his villages in Israel.\nThen the Lord’s people went down to the city gates.",
      "12": "Get up! Get up, Deborah!\nGet up! Get up and create a song! \nBarak, attack! Take your prisoners, son of Abinoam.",
      "13": "Then those mighty men who were left came down.\nThe Lord’s people went into battle for me against the mighty soldiers.",
      "14": "Those who had settled in Amalek’s country\ncame down from Ephraim.\nBenjamin came with its troops\nafter Ephraim.\nCommanders from Machir went into battle.\nThe officers from Zebulun also went.",
      "15": "Issachar’s commanders were with Deborah.\nThey were also with Barak,\nsent into the valley under his command. \nAmong Reuben’s divisions important men had second thoughts.",
      "16": "Why did you sit between the saddlebags?\nWas it to listen to the shepherds playing their flutes?\nReuben’s divisions of important men had second thoughts.",
      "17": "Gilead remained east of the Jordan River.\nAnd Dan … Why did he stay by the ships?\nAsher sat on the seashore and remained along the inlets.",
      "18": "But Zebulun mocked death,\nand Naphtali risked his life on the battlefield.",
      "19": "Kings came and fought.\nThen the kings of Canaan fought.\nThey fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.\nBut they didn’t carry off any rich loot.",
      "20": "The stars fought from heaven.\nThey fought against Sisera from their heavenly paths.",
      "21": "The Kishon River swept them away—\nthat old river, the Kishon. \nI must march on with strength!",
      "22": "Then the horses’ hoofs pounded.\nThe mighty war horses galloped on and on.",
      "23": "“Curse Meroz!” said the Messenger of the Lord.\n“Bitterly curse those who live there!\nThey did not come to help the Lord,\nto help the Lord and his heroes.”",
      "24": "Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite,\nshould be the most blessed woman,\nthe most blessed woman living in a tent.",
      "25": "Sisera asked for water.\nShe gave him milk.\nShe offered him buttermilk in a royal bowl.",
      "26": "She reached for a tent peg with one hand,\nfor a workman’s hammer with the other.\nShe struck Sisera.\nShe crushed his head.\nShe shattered and pierced his temples.",
      "27": "He sank.\nHe fell.\nHe lay between her feet!\nHe sank.\nHe fell between her feet.\nWhere he sank, he fell dead.",
      "28": "Sisera’s mother looked through her window\nand cried as she peered through the lattice.\n“Why is his chariot taking so long?\nWhy don’t I hear the clatter of his chariots?”",
      "29": "Her wisest servants gave her an answer.\nBut she kept repeating to herself,",
      "30": "“They’re really finding and dividing the loot:\nA girl or two for each soldier,\ncolorful clothes for Sisera,\ncolorful, embroidered clothes,\nand two pieces of colorful, embroidered cloth for the neck of the looter.”",
      "31": "May all your enemies die like that, O Lord.\nBut may those who love the Lord\nbe like the sun when it rises in all its brightness.\nSo the land had peace for 40 years."

      "1": "The people of Israel did what the Lord considered evil. So the Lord handed them over to Midian for seven years.",
      "2": "Midian’s power was too strong for Israel. The Israelites made hiding places in the mountains, caves, and mountain strongholds to protect themselves from Midian.",
      "3": "Whenever Israel planted crops, Midian, Amalek, and Kedem came and damaged the crops.",
      "4": "The enemy used to camp on the land and destroy the crops all the way to Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to live on—not one sheep, cow, or donkey.",
      "5": "Like swarms of locusts, they came with their livestock and their tents. They and their camels could not be counted. They came into the land only to ruin it.",
      "6": "So the Israelites became very poor because of Midian and cried out to the Lord for help.",
      "7": "When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help because of what the Midianites had done to them,",
      "8": "the Lord sent a prophet to them. He said, “This is what the Lord God of Israel says:\nI brought you out of Egypt.\nI took you away from slavery.",

      "11": "The Messenger of the Lord came and sat under the oak tree in Ophrah that belonged to Joash from Abiezer’s family. Joash’s son Gideon was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.",
      "12": "The Messenger of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said, “The Lord is with you, brave man.”",
      "13": "Gideon responded, “Excuse me, sir! But if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all the miracles our ancestors have told us about? Didn’t they say, ‘The Lord brought us out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and has handed us over to Midian.”",
      "14": "The Lord turned to him and said, “You will rescue Israel from Midian with the strength you have. I am sending you.”",
      "15": "Gideon said to him, “Excuse me, sir! How can I rescue Israel? Look at my whole family. It’s the weakest one in Manasseh. And me? I’m the least important member of my family.”",

      "18": "Don’t leave until I come back. I want to bring my gift and set it in front of you.”\n“I will stay until you come back,” he said.",
      "19": "Then Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread made with 18 quarts of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. Then he went out and presented them to the Messenger of the Lord under the oak tree.",
      "20": "The Messenger of the Lord told him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” Gideon did so.",
      "21": "Then the Messenger of the Lord touched the meat and the bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared up from the rock and burned the meat and the bread. Then the Messenger of the Lord disappeared.",
      "22": "That’s when Gideon realized that this had been the Messenger of the Lord. So he said, “Lord God! I have seen the Messenger of the Lord face to face.”",
      "23": "The Lord said to him, “Calm down! Don’t be afraid. You will not die.”",
      "24": "So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord. He called it The Lord Calms. To this day it is still in Ophrah, which belongs to Abiezer’s family.",
      "25": "That same night the Lord said to Gideon, “Take a bull from your father’s herd, a bull that is seven years old. Tear down your father’s altar dedicated to the god Baal and cut down the pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah that is next to it.",
      "26": "Then, in the proper way, build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this fortified place. Take this second bull and sacrifice it as a burnt offering on the wood from the Asherah pole that you have cut down.”",
      "27": "Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the Lord had told him to do. However, he didn’t do anything during the day. He was too afraid of his father’s family and the men of the city, so he did it at night.",
      "28": "When the men of the city got up early in the morning, they saw that the Baal altar had been torn down. The Asherah pole next to it had also been cut down. They saw that the second bull had been sacrificed as a burnt offering on the altar that had been built.",
