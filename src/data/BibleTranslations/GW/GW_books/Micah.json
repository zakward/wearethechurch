      "3": "The Lord is going to come from his place.\nHe is going to come down and step on the worship places of the earth.",
      "4": "Mountains will melt under him like wax near a fire.\nValleys will split apart like water pouring down a steep hill.",
      "5": "All this is because of Jacob’s crime and Israel’s sin.\nWhat is Jacob’s crime? Isn’t it Samaria?\nWhat is Judah’s worship place? Isn’t it Jerusalem?",
      "6": "So I will turn Samaria into a pile of rubble,\na place for planting vineyards.\nI will roll its stones down into a valley and expose its foundations.",
      "7": "All its idols will be smashed to pieces.\nAll its wages for being a prostitute will be burned.\nAll its statues will be turned into a pile of rubble.\nSamaria collected its wages for being a prostitute.\nThat money will again pay for prostitutes.",
      "8": "I will mourn and cry because of this.\nI will walk around barefoot and naked.\nI will cry like a jackal and mourn like an ostrich.",

      "10": "Don’t report it in Gath. Don’t cry there.\nRoll in the dust of Beth Leaphrah.",
      "11": "Pass by, naked and ashamed, inhabitants of Shaphir.\nDon’t come out, inhabitants of Zaanan.\nBeth Ezel is in mourning.\nIt will take its support away from you.",
      "12": "Wait anxiously for good, inhabitants of Maroth.\nFrom the Lord disaster will come on the gates of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the horses to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish.\nYou were the first to lead the people of Zion into sin.\nThe rebellious acts of Israel are found in you.",
      "14": "That is why you will give farewell gifts to Moresheth Gath.\nThe town of Achzib will betray the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring a conqueror against the inhabitants of Mareshah.\nThe glory of Israel will come to Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave your head in mourning for the children you love.\nMake yourselves as bald as vultures\nbecause your children will be taken from you into exile."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "How horrible it will be for those who invent trouble\nand work out plans for disaster while in bed.\nWhen the morning dawns, they carry out their plans\nbecause they are able to.",

      "5": "That is why none of you in the Lord’s assembly will draw lots\nto divide your property.",
      "6": "Your prophets say, “Don’t prophesy!\nDon’t prophesy such things!\nDisgrace will never overtake us.”",
      "7": "Should the descendants of Jacob be asked:\nHas the Spirit of the Lord become impatient with you?\nHas he done these things?\nAre his words good for those who live honestly?",
      "8": "Recently, my people have turned into enemies.\nYou take coats from those who pass by without a care\nas they return from war.",
      "9": "You force the women among my people out of their pleasant homes\nand take my glory away from their children forever.",
      "10": "Get up, and go away!\nThis is not a place to rest!\nIt will be destroyed, completely destroyed,\nbecause it offends me.",
      "11": "Liars and frauds may go around and say,\n“We will preach to you about wine and liquor.”\nThey would be just the type of preacher you want.",
      "12": "I will surely gather all of you, Jacob.\nI will surely bring together the few people left in Israel.\nI will gather them together like sheep in a pen,\nlike a flock in its pasture.\nThey will make a lot of noise\nbecause there will be so many people.",

      "3": "You eat my people’s flesh.\nYou strip off their skin.\nYou break their bones to pieces.\nYou chop them up like meat for a pot, like stew meat for a kettle.",
      "4": "Then you will cry to the Lord,\nbut he will not answer you.\nHe will hide his face from you at that time\nbecause you have done evil things.",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says about the prophets who mislead my people:\nWhen they have something to eat, they say, “All is well!”\nBut they declare a holy war against those who don’t feed them.",
      "6": "That is why you will have nights without visions.\nYou will have darkness without revelations.\nThe sun will set on the prophets,\nand the day will turn dark for them.",
      "7": "Seers  will be put to shame.\nThose who practice witchcraft will be disgraced.\nAll of them will cover their faces, because God won’t answer them.",
      "8": "But I am filled with the power of the Lord’s Spirit,\nwith justice, and with strength.\nSo I will tell the descendants of Jacob about their crimes\nand the nation of Israel about its sins.",
      "9": "Listen to this, you leaders of the descendants of Jacob,\nyou rulers of the nation of Israel.\nYou despise justice and pervert everything that is right.",
      "10": "You build Zion on bloodshed and Jerusalem on wickedness.",
      "11": "Your leaders exchange justice for bribes.\nYour priests teach for a price.\nYour prophets tell the future for money.\nBut they rely on the Lord when they say,\n“After all, the Lord is with us.\nNothing bad will happen to us.”",
      "12": "Because of you,\nZion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem will become a pile of rubble,\nand the temple mountain will become a worship site\ncovered with trees."

      "3": "Then he will judge disputes between many people\nand settle arguments between many nations far and wide.\nThey will hammer their swords into plowblades\nand their spears into pruning shears.\nNations will never fight against each other,\nand they will never train for war again.",
      "4": "They will sit under their grapevines and their fig trees,\nand no one will make them afraid.\nThe Lord of Armies has spoken.",
      "5": "All the nations live by the names of their gods,\nbut we will live by the name of the Lord our God forever.",
      "6": "“When that day comes,” declares the Lord,\n“I will gather those who are lame.\nI will bring together those who are scattered\nand those whom I have injured.",
      "7": "I will change those who are lame into a faithful people.\nI will change those who are forced away into a strong nation.”\nThe Lord will rule them on Mount Zion now and forever.",
      "8": "You, Jerusalem, watchtower of the flock,\nstronghold of the people of Zion,\nyour former government will come back to you.\nThe kingdom will return to the people of Jerusalem.",
      "9": "Now why are you crying so loudly?\nDon’t you have a king?\nHas your counselor died?\nPain grips you like a woman in labor.",
      "10": "Daughter of Zion, writhe in pain and groan like a woman in labor.\nNow you will leave the city,\nlive in the open fields,\nand go to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued.\nThere the Lord will reclaim you from your enemies.",
      "11": "But now many nations gather against you.\nThey say, “Let’s dishonor Zion and gloat over it.”",
      "12": "They don’t know the thoughts of the Lord or understand his plan.\nHe will bring them together\nlike cut grain on the threshing floor.",
      "13": "Get up and thresh, people of Zion.\nI will make your horns as hard as iron\nand your hoofs as hard as bronze.\nYou will smash many nations into small pieces.\nYou will claim their loot for the Lord,\ntheir wealth for the Lord of the whole earth."

      "7": "Then the few people left from Jacob will be among many people\nlike dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass.\nThey do not put their hope in humans or wait for mortals.",
      "8": "The few people left from Jacob will be among the nations,\namong many people.\nThey will be like a lion among animals in the forest,\nlike a young lion among flocks of sheep.\nWhen a lion hunts,\nit tramples its victims and tears them to pieces,\nand there is no one to rescue them.",
