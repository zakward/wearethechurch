    "1": {
      "1": "This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
      "2": "The prophet Isaiah wrote,\n“I am sending my messenger ahead of you\nto prepare the way for you.”",
      "3": "“A voice cries out in the desert:\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord!\nMake his paths straight!’ ”",
      "4": "John the Baptizer was in the desert telling people about a baptism of repentance  for the forgiveness of sins.",
      "5": "All Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went to him. As they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.",
      "6": "John was dressed in clothes made from camel’s hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "He announced, “The one who comes after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.",
      "8": "I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.",
      "10": "As Jesus came out of the water, he saw heaven split open and the Spirit coming down to him as a dove.",
      "11": "A voice from heaven said, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you.”",
      "12": "At once the Spirit brought him into the desert,",
      "13": "where he was tempted by Satan for 40 days. He was there with the wild animals, and the angels took care of him.",
      "14": "After John had been put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee and told people the Good News of God.",
      "15": "He said, “The time has come, and God’s kingdom is near. Change the way you think and act, and believe the Good News.”",
      "16": "As he was going along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.",
      "17": "Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me! I will teach you how to catch people instead of fish.”",
      "18": "They immediately left their nets and followed him.",
      "19": "As Jesus went on a little farther, he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing.",
      "20": "He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee and the hired men in the boat and followed Jesus.",
      "21": "Then they went to Capernaum. On the next day of rest—a holy day, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
      "22": "The people were amazed at his teachings. Unlike their experts in Moses’ Teachings, he taught them with authority.",
      "23": "At that time there was a man in the synagogue who was controlled by an evil spirit. He shouted,",
      "24": "“What do you want with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "Jesus ordered the spirit, “Keep quiet, and come out of him!”",
      "26": "The evil spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out of him with a loud shriek.",
      "27": "Everyone was stunned. They said to each other, “What is this? This is a new teaching that has authority behind it! He gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him.”",
      "28": "The news about him spread quickly throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.",
      "29": "After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew. James and John went with them.",
      "30": "Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. The first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her.",
      "31": "Jesus went to her, took her hand, and helped her get up. The fever went away, and she prepared a meal for them.",
      "32": "In the evening, when the sun had set, people brought to him everyone who was sick and those possessed by demons.",
      "33": "The whole city had gathered at his door.",
      "34": "He cured many who were sick with various diseases and forced many demons out of people. However, he would not allow the demons to speak. After all, they knew who he was.",
      "35": "In the morning, long before sunrise, Jesus went to a place where he could be alone to pray.",
      "36": "Simon and his friends searched for him.",
      "37": "When they found him, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”",
      "38": "Jesus said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else, to the small towns that are nearby. I have to spread the Good News in them also. This is why I have come.”",
      "39": "So he went to spread the Good News in the synagogues all over Galilee, and he forced demons out of people.",
      "40": "Then a man with a serious skin disease came to him. The man fell to his knees and begged Jesus, “If you’re willing, you can make me clean.”",
      "41": "Jesus felt sorry for him, reached out, touched him, and said, “I’m willing. So be clean!”",
      "42": "Immediately, his skin disease went away, and he was clean.",
      "43": "Jesus sent him away at once and warned him,",
      "44": "“Don’t tell anyone about this! Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifices which Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.”",
      "45": "When the man left, he began to talk freely. He spread his story so widely that Jesus could no longer enter any city openly. Instead, he stayed in places where he could be alone. But people still kept coming to him from everywhere."

    "2": {
      "1": "Several days later Jesus came back to Capernaum. The report went out that he was home.",
      "2": "Many people had gathered. There was no room left, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking God’s word to them.",
      "3": "Four men came to him carrying a paralyzed man.",
      "4": "Since they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where Jesus was. Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "Some experts in Moses’ Teachings were sitting there. They thought,",
      "7": "“Why does he talk this way? He’s dishonoring God. Who besides God can forgive sins?”",
      "8": "At once, Jesus knew inwardly what they were thinking. He asked them, “Why do you have these thoughts?",
      "9": "Is it easier to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’?",
      "10": "I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man,",
      "11": "“I’m telling you to get up, pick up your cot, and go home!”",
      "12": "The man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and walked away while everyone watched. Everyone was amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”",
      "13": "Jesus went to the seashore again. Large crowds came to him, and he taught them.",
      "14": "When Jesus was leaving, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting in a tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.",
      "15": "Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners who were followers of Jesus were eating with him and his disciples.",
      "16": "When the experts in Moses’ Teachings who were Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard that, he said to them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do. I’ve come to call sinners, not people who think they have God’s approval.”",
      "18": "John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, “Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don’t?”",
      "19": "Jesus replied, “Can wedding guests fast while the groom is still with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.",
      "21": "“No one patches an old coat with a new piece of cloth that will shrink. Otherwise, the new patch will shrink and rip away some of the old cloth, and the tear will become worse.",
      "22": "People don’t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh skins.”",
      "23": "Once on a day of rest—a holy day, Jesus was going through the grainfields. As the disciples walked along, they began to pick the heads of grain.",
      "24": "The Pharisees asked him, “Look! Why are your disciples doing something that is not permitted on the day of rest—a holy day?”",
      "25": "Jesus asked them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he and his men were in need and were hungry?",
      "26": "Haven’t you ever read how he went into the house of God when Abiathar was chief priest and ate the bread of the presence? He had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right. Haven’t you ever read how he also gave some of it to his men?”",
      "27": "Then he added, “The day of rest—a holy day, was made for people, not people for the day of rest.",
      "28": "For this reason the Son of Man has authority over the day of rest—a holy day.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Jesus went into a synagogue again. A man who had a paralyzed hand was there.",
      "2": "The people were watching Jesus closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the day of rest—a holy day, so that they could accuse him of doing something wrong.",
      "3": "So he told the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stand in the center of the synagogue.”",
      "4": "Then he asked them, “Is it right to do good or to do evil on the day of rest—a holy day, to give a person back his health or to let him die?”\nBut they were silent.",
      "5": "Jesus was angry as he looked around at them. He was deeply hurt because their minds were closed. Then he told the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand became normal again.",
      "6": "The Pharisees left, and with Herod’s followers they immediately plotted to kill Jesus.",
      "7": "Jesus left with his disciples for the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,",
      "8": "Jerusalem, Idumea, and from across the Jordan River, and from around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they had heard about everything he was doing.",
      "9": "Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready so that the crowd would not crush him.",
      "10": "He had cured so many that everyone with a disease rushed up to him in order to touch him.",
      "11": "Whenever people with evil spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and shout, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "He gave them orders not to tell people who he was.",
      "13": "Jesus went up a mountain, called those whom he wanted, and they came to him.",
      "14": "He appointed twelve whom he called apostles. They were to accompany him and to be sent out by him to spread the Good News.",
      "15": "They also had the authority to force demons out of people.",
      "16": "He appointed these twelve: Simon (whom Jesus named Peter),",
      "17": "James and his brother John (Zebedee’s sons whom Jesus named Boanerges, which means “Thunderbolts”),",
      "18": "Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed Jesus).",
      "20": "Then Jesus went home. Another crowd gathered so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.",
      "21": "When his family heard about it, they went to get him. They said, “He’s out of his mind!”",
      "22": "The experts in Moses’ Teachings who had come from Jerusalem said, “Beelzebul is in him,” and “He forces demons out of people with the help of the ruler of demons.”",
      "23": "Jesus called them together and used this illustration: “How can Satan force out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot last.",
      "25": "And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not last.",
      "26": "So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot last. That will be the end of him.",
      "27": "“No one can go into a strong man’s house and steal his property. First he must tie up the strong man. Then he can go through the strong man’s house and steal his property.",
      "28": "“I can guarantee this truth: People will be forgiven for any sin or curse.",
      "29": "But whoever curses the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. He is guilty of an everlasting sin.”",
      "30": "Jesus said this because the experts in Moses’ Teachings had said that he had an evil spirit.",
      "31": "Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent someone to ask him to come out.",
      "32": "The crowd sitting around Jesus told him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”",
      "33": "He replied to them, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”",
      "34": "Then looking at those who sat in a circle around him, he said, “Look, here are my mother and my brothers.",
      "35": "Whoever does what God wants is my brother and sister and mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Jesus began to teach again by the Sea of Galilee. A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it. The boat was in the water while the entire crowd lined the shore.",
      "2": "He used stories as illustrations to teach them many things.\nWhile he was teaching them, he said,",
      "3": "“Listen! A farmer went to plant seed.",
      "4": "Some seeds were planted along the road, and birds came and devoured them.",
      "5": "Other seeds were planted on rocky ground, where there wasn’t much soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil wasn’t deep.",
      "6": "When the sun came up, they were scorched. They didn’t have any roots, so they withered.",
      "7": "Other seeds were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up and choked them, and they didn’t produce anything.",
      "8": "But other seeds were planted on good ground, sprouted, and produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred times as much as was planted.”",
      "9": "He added, “Let the person who has ears listen!”",
      "10": "When he was alone with his followers and the twelve apostles, they asked him about the stories.",
      "11": "Jesus replied to them, “The mystery about God’s kingdom has been given directly to you. To those on the outside, it is given in stories:",
      "12": "‘They see clearly but don’t perceive.\nThey hear clearly but don’t understand.\nThey never return to me\nand are never forgiven.’ ”",
      "13": "Jesus asked them, “Don’t you understand this story? How, then, will you understand any of the stories I use as illustrations?",
      "14": "“The farmer plants the word.",
      "15": "Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. Whenever they hear the word, Satan comes at once and takes away the word that was planted in them.",
      "16": "Other people are like seeds that were planted on rocky ground. Whenever they hear the word, they accept it at once with joy.",
      "17": "But they don’t develop any roots. They last for a short time. When suffering or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall from faith.",
      "18": "Other people are like seeds planted among thornbushes. They hear the word,",
      "19": "but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of riches, and the desires for other things take over. They choke the word so that it can’t produce anything.",
      "20": "Others are like seeds planted on good ground. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops—thirty, sixty, or one hundred times as much as was planted.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to them, “Does anyone bring a lamp into a room to put it under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a lamp stand?",
      "22": "There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.",
      "23": "Let the person who has ears listen!”",
      "24": "He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you’re listening to! Knowledge will be measured out to you by the measure of attention you give. This is the way knowledge increases.",
      "25": "Those who understand these mysteries will be given more knowledge. However, some people don’t understand these mysteries. Even what they understand will be taken away from them.”",
      "26": "Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.",
      "27": "He sleeps at night and is awake during the day. The seeds sprout and grow, although the man doesn’t know how.",
      "28": "The ground produces grain by itself. First the green blade appears, then the head, then the head full of grain.",
      "29": "As soon as the grain is ready, he cuts it with a sickle, because harvest time has come.”",
      "30": "Jesus asked, “How can we show what God’s kingdom is like? To what can we compare it?",
      "31": "It’s like a mustard seed planted in the ground. The mustard seed is one of the smallest seeds on earth.",
      "32": "However, when planted, it comes up and becomes taller than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that birds can nest in its shade.”",
      "33": "Jesus spoke God’s word to them using many illustrations like these. In this way people could understand what he taught.",
      "34": "He did not speak to them without using an illustration. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.",
      "35": "That evening, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s cross to the other side.”",
      "36": "Leaving the crowd, they took Jesus along in a boat just as he was. Other boats were with him.",
      "37": "A violent windstorm came up. The waves were breaking into the boat so that it was quickly filling up.",
      "38": "But he was sleeping on a cushion in the back of the boat.\nSo they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to die?”",
      "39": "Then he got up, ordered the wind to stop, and said to the sea, “Be still, absolutely still!” The wind stopped blowing, and the sea became very calm.",
      "40": "He asked them, “Why are you such cowards? Don’t you have any faith yet?”",
      "41": "They were overcome with fear and asked each other, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They arrived in the territory of the Gerasenes on the other side of the Sea of Galilee.",
      "2": "As Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man came out of the tombs and met him. The man was controlled by an evil spirit",
      "3": "and lived among the tombs. No one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain.",
      "4": "He had often been chained hand and foot. However, he snapped the chains off his hands and broke the chains from his feet. No one could control him.",
      "5": "Night and day he was among the tombs and on the mountainsides screaming and cutting himself with stones.",
      "6": "The man saw Jesus at a distance. So he ran to Jesus, bowed down in front of him,",
      "7": "and shouted, “Why are you bothering me now, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won’t torture me.”",
      "8": "He shouted this because Jesus said, “You evil spirit, come out of the man.”",
      "9": "Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\nHe told Jesus, “My name is Legion [Six Thousand], because there are many of us.”",
      "10": "He begged Jesus not to send them out of the territory.",
      "11": "A large herd of pigs was feeding on a mountainside nearby.",
      "12": "The demons begged him, “Send us into the pigs! Let us enter them!”",
      "13": "Jesus let them do this. The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned.",
      "14": "Those who took care of the pigs ran away. In the city and countryside they reported everything that had happened. So the people came to see what had happened.",
      "15": "They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. The man was sitting there dressed and in his right mind. The people were frightened.",
      "16": "Those who saw this told what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.",
      "17": "Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.",
      "18": "As Jesus stepped into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him, “Let me stay with you.”",
      "19": "But Jesus would not allow it. Instead, he told the man, “Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.”",
      "20": "So the man left. He began to tell how much Jesus had done for him in the Ten Cities. Everyone was amazed.",
      "21": "Jesus again crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee in a boat. A large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.",
      "22": "A synagogue leader named Jairus also arrived. When he saw Jesus, he quickly bowed down in front of him.",
      "23": "He begged Jesus, “My little daughter is dying. Come, lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”",
      "24": "Jesus went with the man. A huge crowd followed Jesus and pressed him on every side.",
      "25": "In the crowd was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years.",
      "26": "Although she had been under the care of many doctors and had spent all her money, she had not been helped at all. Actually, she had become worse.",
      "27": "Since she had heard about Jesus, she came from behind in the crowd and touched his clothes.",
      "28": "She said, “If I can just touch his clothes, I’ll get well.”",
      "29": "Her bleeding stopped immediately. She felt cured from her illness.",
      "30": "At that moment Jesus felt power had gone out of him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”",
      "31": "His disciples said to him, “How can you ask, ‘Who touched me,’ when you see the crowd pressing you on all sides?”",
      "32": "But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this.",
      "33": "The woman trembled with fear. She knew what had happened to her. So she quickly bowed in front of him and told him the whole truth.",
      "34": "Jesus told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness.”",
      "35": "While Jesus was still speaking to her, some people came from the synagogue leader’s home. They told the synagogue leader, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher anymore?”",
      "36": "When Jesus overheard what they said, he told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid! Just believe.”",
      "37": "Jesus allowed no one to go with him except Peter and the two brothers James and John.",
      "38": "When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a noisy crowd there. People were crying and sobbing loudly.",
      "39": "When he came into the house, he asked them, “Why are you making so much noise and crying? The child isn’t dead. She’s just sleeping.”",
      "40": "They laughed at him. So he made all of them go outside. Then he took the child’s father, mother, and his three disciples and went to the child.",
      "41": "Jesus took the child’s hand and said to her, “Talitha, koum!” which means, “Little girl, I’m telling you to get up!”",
      "42": "The girl got up at once and started to walk. (She was twelve years old.) They were astonished.",
      "43": "Jesus ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give the little girl something to eat."

    "6": {
      "1": "Jesus left that place and went to his hometown. His disciples followed him.",
      "2": "When the day of rest—a holy day, came, he began to teach in the synagogue. He amazed many who heard him. They asked, “Where did this man get these ideas? Who gave him this kind of wisdom and the ability to do such great miracles?",
      "3": "Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” So they took offense at him.",
      "4": "But Jesus told them, “The only place a prophet isn’t honored is in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.”",
      "5": "He couldn’t work any miracles there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them.",
      "6": "Their unbelief amazed him.\nThen Jesus went around to the villages and taught.",
      "7": "He called the twelve apostles, sent them out two by two, and gave them authority over evil spirits.",
      "8": "He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick. They were not to take any food, a traveling bag, or money in their pockets.",
      "9": "They could wear sandals but could not take along a change of clothes.",
      "10": "He told them, “Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you’re ready to leave that place.",
      "11": "Wherever people don’t welcome you or listen to you, leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.”",
      "12": "So the apostles went and told people that they should turn to God and change the way they think and act.",
      "13": "They also forced many demons out of people and poured oil on many who were sick to cure them.",
      "14": "King Herod heard about Jesus, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. Some people were saying, “John the Baptizer has come back to life. That’s why he has the power to perform these miracles.”",
      "15": "Others said, “He is Elijah.” Still others said, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”",
      "16": "But when Herod heard about it, he said, “I had John’s head cut off, and he has come back to life!”",
      "17": "Herod had sent men who had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison. Herod did that for Herodias, whom he had married. (She used to be his brother Philip’s wife.)",
      "18": "John had been telling Herod, “It’s not right for you to be married to your brother’s wife.”",
      "19": "So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she wasn’t allowed to do it",
