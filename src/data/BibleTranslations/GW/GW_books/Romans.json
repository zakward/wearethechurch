      "1": "From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and appointed to spread the Good News of God.",
      "2": "(God had already promised this Good News through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures.",
      "3": "This Good News is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. In his human nature he was a descendant of David.",
      "4": "In his spiritual, holy nature he was declared the Son of God. This was shown in a powerful way when he came back to life.",
      "5": "Through him we have received God’s kindness  and the privilege of being apostles who bring people from every nation to the obedience that is associated with faith. This is for the honor of his name.",
      "6": "You are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.)",
      "7": "To everyone in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his holy people.\nGood will  and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are yours!",
      "8": "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for every one of you because the news of your faith is spreading throughout the whole world.",
      "9": "I serve God by spreading the Good News about his Son. God is my witness that I always mention you",
      "10": "every time I pray. I ask that somehow God will now at last make it possible for me to visit you.",
      "11": "I long to see you to share a spiritual blessing with you so that you will be strengthened.",
      "12": "What I mean is that we may be encouraged by each other’s faith.",
      "13": "I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I often planned to visit you. However, until now I have been kept from doing so. What I want is to enjoy some of the results of working among you as I have also enjoyed the results of working among the rest of the nations.",
      "14": "I have an obligation to those who are civilized and those who aren’t, to those who are wise and those who aren’t.",
      "15": "That’s why I’m eager to tell you who live in Rome the Good News also.",
      "16": "I’m not ashamed of the Good News. It is God’s power to save everyone who believes, Jews first and Greeks as well.",
      "17": "God’s approval is revealed in this Good News. This approval begins and ends with faith as Scripture says, “The person who has God’s approval will live by faith.”",
      "18": "God’s anger is revealed from heaven against every ungodly and immoral thing people do as they try to suppress the truth by their immoral living.",
      "19": "What can be known about God is clear to them because he has made it clear to them.",
      "20": "From the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly observed in what he made. As a result, people have no excuse.",
      "21": "They knew God but did not praise and thank him for being God. Instead, their thoughts were pointless, and their misguided minds were plunged into darkness.",
      "22": "While claiming to be wise, they became fools.",
      "23": "They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for statues that looked like mortal humans, birds, animals, and snakes.",
      "24": "For this reason God allowed their lusts to control them. As a result, they dishonor their bodies by sexual perversion with each other.",
      "25": "These people have exchanged God’s truth for a lie. So they have become ungodly and serve what is created rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen!",
      "26": "For this reason God allowed their shameful passions to control them. Their women have exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.",
      "27": "Likewise, their men have given up natural sexual relations with women and burn with lust for each other. Men commit indecent acts with men, so they experience among themselves the punishment they deserve for their perversion.",
      "28": "And because they thought it was worthless to acknowledge God, God allowed their own immoral minds to control them. So they do these indecent things.",
      "29": "Their lives are filled with all kinds of sexual sins, wickedness, and greed. They are mean. They are filled with envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,",
      "30": "slanderers, haters of God, haughty, arrogant, and boastful. They think up new ways to be cruel. They don’t obey their parents,",
      "31": "don’t have any sense, don’t keep promises, and don’t show love to their own families or mercy to others.",
      "32": "Although they know God’s judgment that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do these things but also approve of others who do them."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "No matter who you are, if you judge anyone, you have no excuse. When you judge another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things.",
      "2": "We know that God’s judgment is right when he condemns people for doing these things.",
      "3": "When you judge people for doing these things but then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?",
      "4": "Do you have contempt for God, who is very kind to you, puts up with you, and deals patiently with you? Don’t you realize that it is God’s kindness that is trying to lead you to him and change the way you think and act?",
      "5": "Since you are stubborn and don’t want to change the way you think and act, you are adding to the anger that God will have against you on that day when God vents his anger. At that time God will reveal that his decisions are fair.",
      "6": "He will pay all people back for what they have done.",
      "7": "He will give everlasting life to those who search for glory, honor, and immortality by persisting in doing what is good. But he will bring",
      "8": "anger and fury on those who, in selfish pride, refuse to believe the truth and who follow what is wrong.",
      "9": "There will be suffering and distress for every person who does evil, for Jews first and Greeks as well.",
      "10": "But there will be glory, honor, and peace for every person who does what is good, for Jews first and Greeks as well.",
      "11": "God does not play favorites.",
      "12": "Here’s the reason: Whoever sins without having the laws in Moses’ Teachings will still be condemned to destruction. And whoever has these laws from God and sins will still be judged by them.",
      "13": "People who merely listen to the laws in Moses’ Teachings don’t have God’s approval. Rather, people who do what those laws demand will have God’s approval.",
      "14": "For example, whenever non-Jews who don’t have the laws in Moses’ Teachings do by nature the things that those laws contain, they are a law to themselves even though they don’t have any of those laws.",
      "15": "They show that some requirements found in Moses’ Teachings are written in their hearts. Their consciences speak to them. Their thoughts accuse them on one occasion and defend them on another.",
      "16": "This happens as they face the day when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge people’s secret thoughts. He will use the Good News that I am spreading to make that judgment.",
      "17": "You call yourself a Jew, rely on the laws in Moses’ Teachings, brag about your God,",
      "18": "know what he wants, and distinguish right from wrong because you have been taught Moses’ Teachings.",
      "19": "You are confident that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in the dark,",
      "20": "an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of children because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in Moses’ Teachings.",
      "21": "As you teach others, are you failing to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, are you stealing?",
      "22": "As you tell others not to commit adultery, are you committing adultery? As you treat idols with disgust, are you robbing temples?",
      "23": "As you brag about the laws in Moses’ Teachings, are you dishonoring God by ignoring those laws?",
      "24": "As Scripture says, “God’s name is cursed among the nations because of you.”",
      "25": "For example, circumcision is valuable if you follow the laws in Moses’ Teachings. If you don’t follow those laws, your circumcision amounts to uncircumcision.",
      "26": "So if a man does what those laws demand, won’t he be considered circumcised even if he is uncircumcised?",
      "27": "The uncircumcised man who carries out what those laws say will condemn you for not following them. He will condemn you in spite of the fact that you are circumcised and have those laws in writing.",
      "28": "A person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision a matter of how the body looks.",
      "29": "Rather, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is something that happens in a person’s heart. Circumcision is spiritual, not just a written rule. That person’s praise will come from God, not from people."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Is there any advantage, then, in being a Jew? Or is there any value in being circumcised?",
      "2": "There are all kinds of advantages. First of all, God entrusted them with his word.",
      "3": "What if some of them were unfaithful? Can their unfaithfulness cancel God’s faithfulness?",
      "4": "That would be unthinkable! God is honest, and everyone else is a liar, as Scripture says,\n“So you hand down justice when you speak,\nand you win your case in court.”",
      "5": "But if what we do wrong shows that God is fair, what should we say? Is God unfair when he vents his anger on us? (I’m arguing the way humans would.)",
      "6": "That’s unthinkable! Otherwise, how would God be able to judge the world?",
      "7": "If my lie increases the glory that God receives by showing that God is truthful, why am I still judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "Or can we say, “Let’s do evil so that good will come from it”? Some slander us and claim that this is what we say. They are condemned, and that’s what they deserve.",
      "9": "What, then, is the situation? Do we have any advantage? Not at all. We have already accused everyone (both Jews and Greeks) of being under the power of sin,",
      "10": "as Scripture says,\n“Not one person has God’s approval.",
      "11": "No one understands.\nNo one searches for God.",
      "12": "Everyone has turned away.\nTogether they have become rotten to the core.\nNo one does anything good,\nnot even one person.",
      "13": "Their throats are open graves.\nTheir tongues practice deception.\nTheir lips hide the venom of poisonous snakes.",
      "14": "Their mouths are full of curses and bitter resentment.",
      "15": "They run quickly to murder people.",
      "16": "There is ruin and suffering wherever they go.",
      "17": "They have not learned to live in peace.",
      "18": "They are not terrified of God.”",
      "19": "We know that whatever the Scriptures say applies to everyone under their influence, and no one can say a thing. The whole world is brought under the judgment of God.",
      "20": "Not one person can have God’s approval by any effort to follow the laws in the Scriptures. These laws show what sin is.",
      "21": "Now, the way to receive God’s approval has been made plain in a way other than the laws in the Scriptures. Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets tell us this.",
      "22": "Everyone who believes has God’s approval through faith in Jesus Christ.\nThere is no difference between people.",
      "23": "Because all people have sinned, they have fallen short of God’s glory.",
      "24": "They receive God’s approval freely by an act of his kindness  through the price Christ Jesus paid to set us free from sin.",
      "25": "God showed that Christ is the throne of mercy where God’s approval is given through faith in Christ’s blood. In his patience God waited to deal with sins committed in the past.",
      "26": "He waited so that he could display his approval at the present time. This shows that he is a God of justice, a God who approves of people who believe in Jesus.",
      "27": "So, do we have anything to brag about? Bragging has been eliminated. On what basis was it eliminated? On the basis of our own efforts? No, indeed! Rather, it is eliminated on the basis of faith.",
      "28": "We conclude that a person has God’s approval by faith, not by his own efforts.",
      "29": "Is God only the God of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of people who are not Jewish? Certainly, he is,",
      "30": "since it is the same God who approves circumcised people by faith and uncircumcised people through this same faith.",
      "31": "Are we abolishing the laws in the Scriptures by this faith? That’s unthinkable! Rather, we are supporting these laws."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "What can we say that we have discovered about our ancestor Abraham?",
      "2": "If Abraham had God’s approval because of something he did, he would have had a reason to brag. But he could not brag to God about it.",
      "3": "What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and that faith was regarded as the basis of Abraham’s approval by God.”",
      "4": "When people work, their pay is not regarded as a gift but something they have earned.",
      "5": "However, when people don’t work but believe God, the one who approves ungodly people, their faith is regarded as the basis of God’s approval.",
      "6": "David says the same thing about those who are blessed: God approves of people without their earning it. David said,",
      "7": "“Blessed are those whose disobedience is forgiven\nand whose sins are pardoned.",
      "8": "Blessed is the person whom the Lord no longer considers sinful.”",
      "9": "Are only the circumcised people blessed, or are uncircumcised people blessed as well? We say, “Abraham’s faith was regarded as the basis of God’s approval.”",
      "10": "How was his faith regarded as the basis of God’s approval? Was he circumcised or was he uncircumcised at that time? He had not been circumcised.",
      "11": "Abraham’s faith was the basis of his approval by God while he was still uncircumcised. The mark of circumcision is the seal of that approval. Therefore, he is the father of every believer who is not circumcised, and their faith, too, is regarded as the basis of their approval by God.",
      "12": "He is also the father of those who not only are circumcised but also are following in the footsteps of his faith. Our father Abraham had that faith before he was circumcised.",
      "13": "So it was not by obeying the laws in Moses’ Teachings that Abraham or his descendants received the promise that he would inherit the world. Rather, he received this promise through God’s approval that comes by faith.",
      "14": "If those who obey Moses’ Teachings are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless.",
      "15": "The laws in Moses’ Teachings bring about anger. But where those laws don’t exist, they can’t be broken.",
      "16": "Therefore, the promise is based on faith so that it can be a gift. Consequently, the promise is guaranteed for every descendant, not only for those who are descendants by obeying Moses’ Teachings but also for those who are descendants by believing as Abraham did. He is the father of all of us,",
      "17": "as Scripture says: “I have made you a father of many nations.”\nAbraham believed when he stood in the presence of the God who gives life to dead people and calls into existence things that don’t even exist.",
      "18": "When there was nothing left to hope for, Abraham still hoped and believed. As a result, he became a father of many nations, as he had been told: “That is how many descendants you will have.”",
      "19": "Abraham didn’t weaken. Through faith he regarded the facts: His body was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old, and Sarah was unable to have children.",
      "20": "He didn’t doubt God’s promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, giving honor to God for the promise, he became strong because of faith",
      "21": "and was absolutely confident that God would do what he promised.",
      "22": "That is why Abraham’s faith was regarded as the basis of his approval by God.",
      "23": "But the words “his faith was regarded as the basis of his approval by God” were written not only for him",
      "24": "but also for us. Our faith will be regarded as the basis of our approval by God—each of us who believe in the one who brought Jesus, our Lord, back to life.",
      "25": "Jesus, our Lord, was handed over to death because of our failures and was brought back to life so that we could receive God’s approval."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Now that we have God’s approval by faith, we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done.",
      "2": "Through Christ we can approach God  and stand in his favor. So we brag because of our confidence that we will receive glory from God.",
      "3": "But that’s not all. We also brag when we are suffering. We know that suffering creates endurance,",
      "4": "endurance creates character, and character creates confidence.",
      "5": "We’re not ashamed to have this confidence, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.",
      "6": "Look at it this way: At the right time, while we were still helpless, Christ died for ungodly people.",
      "7": "Finding someone who would die for a godly person is rare. Maybe someone would have the courage to die for a good person.",
      "8": "Christ died for us while we were still sinners. This demonstrates God’s love for us.",
      "9": "Since Christ’s blood has now given us God’s approval, we are even more certain that Christ will save us from God’s anger.",
      "10": "If the death of his Son restored our relationship with God while we were still his enemies, we are even more certain that, because of this restored relationship, the life of his Son will save us.",
      "11": "In addition, our Lord Jesus Christ lets us continue to brag about God. After all, it is through Christ that we now have this restored relationship with God.",
      "12": "Sin came into the world through one person, and death came through sin. So death spread to everyone, because everyone sinned.",
      "13": "Sin was in the world before there were any laws. But no record of sin can be kept when there are no laws.",
      "14": "Yet, death ruled from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. Adam is an image of the one who would come.",
      "15": "There is no comparison between God’s gift and Adam’s failure. If humanity died as the result of one person’s failure, it is certainly true that God’s kindness  and the gift given through the kindness of one person, Jesus Christ, have been showered on humanity.",
      "16": "There is also no comparison between God’s gift and the one who sinned. The verdict which followed one person’s failure condemned everyone. But, even after many failures, the gift brought God’s approval.",
      "17": "It is certain that death ruled because of one person’s failure. It’s even more certain that those who receive God’s overflowing kindness and the gift of his approval will rule in life because of one person, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "Therefore, everyone was condemned through one failure, and everyone received God’s life-giving approval through one verdict.",
      "19": "Clearly, through one person’s disobedience humanity became sinful, and through one person’s obedience humanity will receive God’s approval.",
      "20": "The laws in Moses’ Teachings were added to increase the failure. But where sin increased, God’s kindness increased even more.",
      "21": "As sin ruled by bringing death, God’s kindness would rule by bringing us his approval. This results in our living forever because of Jesus Christ our Lord."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "What should we say then? Should we continue to sin so that God’s kindness  will increase?",
      "2": "That’s unthinkable! As far as sin is concerned, we have died. So how can we still live under sin’s influence?",
      "3": "Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
      "4": "When we were baptized into his death, we were placed into the tomb with him. As Christ was brought back from death to life by the glorious power of the Father, so we, too, should live a new kind of life.",
      "5": "If we’ve become united with him in a death like his, certainly we will also be united with him when we come back to life as he did.",
      "6": "We know that the person we used to be was crucified with him to put an end to sin in our bodies. Because of this we are no longer slaves to sin.",
      "7": "The person who has died has been freed from sin.",
      "8": "If we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.",
      "9": "We know that Christ, who was brought back to life, will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him.",
      "10": "When he died, he died once and for all to sin’s power. But now he lives, and he lives for God.",
      "11": "So consider yourselves dead to sin’s power but living for God in the power Christ Jesus gives you.",
      "12": "Therefore, never let sin rule your physical body so that you obey its desires.",
      "13": "Never offer any part of your body to sin’s power. No part of your body should ever be used to do any ungodly thing. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have come back from death and are now alive. Offer all the parts of your body to God. Use them to do everything that God approves of.",
      "14": "Certainly, sin shouldn’t have power over you because you’re not controlled by God’s laws, but by God’s favor.",
      "15": "Then what is the implication? Should we sin because we are not controlled by God’s laws but by God’s favor? That’s unthinkable!",
      "16": "Don’t you know that if you offer to be someone’s slave, you must obey that master? Either your master is sin, or your master is obedience. Letting sin be your master leads to death. Letting obedience be your master leads to God’s approval.",
      "17": "You were slaves to sin. But I thank God that you have become wholeheartedly obedient to the teachings which you were given.",
      "18": "Freed from sin, you were made slaves who do what God approves of.",
      "19": "I’m speaking in a human way because of the weakness of your corrupt nature. Clearly, you once offered all the parts of your body as slaves to sexual perversion and disobedience. This led you to live disobedient lives. Now, in the same way, offer all the parts of your body as slaves that do what God approves of. This leads you to live holy lives.",
      "20": "When you were slaves to sin, you were free from doing what God approves of.",
      "21": "What did you gain by doing those things? You’re ashamed of what you used to do because it ended in death.",
      "22": "Now you have been freed from sin and have become God’s slaves. This results in a holy life and, finally, in everlasting life.",
      "23": "The payment for sin is death, but the gift that God freely gives is everlasting life found in Christ Jesus our Lord."

    "7": {
      "1": "Don’t you realize, brothers and sisters, that laws have power over people only as long as they are alive? (I’m speaking to people who are familiar with Moses’ Teachings.)",
      "2": "For example, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he is alive. But if her husband dies, that marriage law is no longer in effect for her.",
      "3": "So if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she will be called an adulterer. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so she is not committing adultery if she marries another man.",
      "4": "In the same way, brothers and sisters, you have died to the laws in Moses’ Teachings through Christ’s body. You belong to someone else, the one who was brought back to life.\nAs a result, we can do what God wants.",
      "5": "While we were living under the influence of our corrupt nature, sinful passions were at work throughout our bodies. Stirred up by the laws in Moses’ Teachings, our sinful passions did things that result in death.",
      "6": "But now we have died to those laws that bound us. God has broken their effect on us so that we are serving in a new spiritual way, not in an old way dictated by written words.",
      "7": "What should we say, then? Are the laws in Moses’ Teachings sinful? That’s unthinkable! In fact, I wouldn’t have recognized sin if those laws hadn’t shown it to me. For example, I wouldn’t have known that some desires are sinful if Moses’ Teachings hadn’t said, “Never have wrong desires.”",
      "8": "But sin took the opportunity provided by this commandment and made me have all kinds of wrong desires. Clearly, without laws sin is dead.",
      "9": "At one time I was alive without any laws. But when this commandment came, sin became alive",
      "10": "and I died. I found that the commandment which was intended to bring me life actually brought me death.",
      "11": "Sin, taking the opportunity provided by this commandment, deceived me and then killed me.",
      "12": "So the laws in Moses’ Teachings are holy, and the commandment is holy, right, and good.",
      "13": "Now, did something good cause my death? That’s unthinkable! Rather, my death was caused by sin so that sin would be recognized for what it is. Through a commandment sin became more sinful than ever.",
      "14": "I know that God’s standards in Moses’ Teachings are spiritual, but I have a corrupt nature, sold as a slave to sin.",
      "15": "I don’t realize what I’m doing. I don’t do what I want to do. Instead, I do what I hate.",
      "16": "I don’t do what I want to do, but I agree that God’s standards are good.",
      "17": "So I am no longer the one who is doing the things I hate, but sin that lives in me is doing them.",

      "19": "I don’t do the good I want to do. Instead, I do the evil that I don’t want to do.",
      "20": "Now, when I do what I don’t want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it. Sin that lives in me is doing it.",
      "21": "So I’ve discovered this truth: Evil is present with me even when I want to do what God’s standards say is good.",
      "22": "I take pleasure in God’s standards in my inner being.",
      "23": "However, I see a different standard at work throughout my body. It is at war with the standards my mind sets and tries to take me captive to sin’s standards which still exist throughout my body.",
      "24": "What a miserable person I am! Who will rescue me from my dying body?",
      "25": "I thank God that our Lord Jesus Christ rescues me! So I am obedient to God’s standards with my mind, but I am obedient to sin’s standards with my corrupt nature."
