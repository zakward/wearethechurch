      "3": "“Where did you come from?” David asked him.\n“I escaped from the camp of Israel,” he answered.",
      "4": "“What happened?” David asked him. “Please tell me.”\nThe man answered, “The army fled from the battle, and many of the soldiers died. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead too.”",
      "5": "“How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” David asked the young man who had brought him the news.",
      "6": "The young man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Saul was there leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen were catching up with him.",
      "7": "When he looked back and saw me, he called to me, and I said, ‘Yes?’ ”",
      "8": "“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’\n“I said to him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "“He said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me. I’m alive, but I’m suffering.’",

      "16": "Each one grabbed his opponent by the head, stuck his sword into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. Therefore, that place in Gibeon is called the Field of Enemies.",

      "24": "But Joab and Abishai chased Abner. When the sun went down, they came to the hill of Ammah, opposite Giah on the road from Gibeon to the desert.",
      "25": "The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner, banding together and taking their position on top of a hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called to Joab, “Should this slaughter go on forever? Don’t you know this will end in bitterness? How long will it be before you will call off your troops from chasing their relatives?”",
      "27": "Joab answered, “I solemnly swear, as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would not have stopped chasing their relatives until morning.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew a ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped. They didn’t chase or fight Israel anymore.",
      "29": "Abner and his men marched through the plains all that night. They crossed the Jordan River and passed through the entire Bithron until they came to Mahanaim.",

      "8": "Ishbosheth’s question made Abner very angry. “Have I been behaving like some Judean dog?” he asked. “Until now I’ve been faithful to your father Saul’s family, to his relatives and friends, and I haven’t handed you over to David. But now you charge me with a crime because of this woman.",

      "11": "Ishbosheth couldn’t respond to a single word, because he was afraid of Abner.",

      "14": "Then David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ishbosheth to say, “Give me my wife Michal. I made a payment of 100 Philistine foreskins for her.”",

      "16": "Her husband went with her and cried over her all the way to Bahurim. “Go home,” Abner told him. So he went home.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Abner sent the following message to the leaders of Israel: “For some time now you’ve wanted to make David your king.",

      "19": "Abner also spoke specifically to the people of Benjamin.\nThen Abner went directly to David in Hebron to tell him everything Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin had approved.",

      "21": "Abner told David, “I must go now so that I can gather all Israel for you, Your Majesty. They will make a treaty with you, and you will rule everything your heart desires.” Then David dismissed Abner, who left peacefully.",
      "22": "Just then David’s men and Joab were coming home from a raid with a lot of goods. Abner had been dismissed, so he was no longer with David in Hebron.",
      "23": "When Joab came back with the whole army, he was told, “Ner’s son Abner came to the king, but David dismissed him, and Abner left peacefully.”",
      "24": "Then Joab went to the king and asked, “What have you done? Abner came to see you. Why did you dismiss him and let him get away?",
      "25": "Certainly you must know that Ner’s son Abner came to deceive you, to find out about your movements and learn everything you’re doing!”",
      "26": "After leaving David, Joab sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the cistern of Sirah without David knowing about it.",
      "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway as if to talk to him privately. There he stabbed Abner in the belly. Abner died because he spilled the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel.",
      "28": "Later when David heard about it, he said, “As far as the Lord is concerned, my kingdom and I are forever innocent of spilling the blood of Ner’s son Abner.",
      "29": "May the blame fall on the head of Joab and all of his family. May there always be members of Joab’s family who have oozing sores and skin diseases, who can only work a spindle, who die in battle, and who never have any food.”",
      "30": "(Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)",

      "38": "The king said to his officers, “Don’t you know that today a leader, a great man, has fallen in Israel?",

      "4": "In addition, Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled to Gittaim. She was in a hurry when she left, and he fell from her arms and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)",

      "7": "(They had come into the house while Ishbosheth was sleeping on his bed in his bedroom. They stabbed him, killed him, and cut off his head.) They took his head and traveled all night along the road to the plains.",
      "8": "They brought Ishbosheth’s head to David at Hebron. “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you,” they told the king. “Today the Lord has given Your Royal Majesty revenge on Saul and his descendants.”",

      "12": "So David gave an order to his young men, who executed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung their dead bodies by the pond in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron."
