      "1": "These are the words of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah:\nDuring the month of Chislev, in Artaxerxes’ twentieth year as king, while I was in the fortress at Susa,",
      "2": "one of my brothers, Hanani, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had survived captivity and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They told me, “Those who survived captivity are in the province. They are enduring serious troubles and being insulted. The wall of Jerusalem has been broken down, and its gates have been destroyed by fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard this, I sat down and cried. I mourned for days. I continued to fast and pray to the God of heaven.",
      "5": "I said,\n“Lord God of heaven, great and awe-inspiring God, you faithfully keep your promise  and show mercy to those who love you and obey your commandments.",
      "6": "Open your eyes, and pay close attention with your ears to what I, your servant, am praying. I am praying to you day and night about your servants the Israelites. I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against you as well as the sins that my father’s family and I have committed.",
      "7": "We have done you a great wrong. We haven’t obeyed the commandments, laws, or regulations that you gave us through your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Please remember what you told us through your servant Moses: ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations.",
      "9": "But if you return to me and continue to obey my commandments, though your people may be driven to the most distant point on the horizon, I will come and get you from there and bring you to the place where I chose to put my name.’",
      "10": "These are your servants and your people whom you have saved by your great power and your strong hand.",
      "11": "Lord, please pay attention to my prayer and to the prayers of all your other servants who want to worship your name. Please give me success today and make this man, King Artaxerxes, show me compassion.”\nI was cupbearer  to the king at this time."

      "1": "In the month of Nisan, in Artaxerxes’ twentieth year as king, after some wine was brought for the king, I picked up the cup of wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence before.",
      "2": "The king asked me, “Why do you look so sad? You aren’t sick, are you? You must be troubled about something.” (I was really afraid).",
      "3": "“May the king live forever!” I said to the king. “Why shouldn’t I look sad when the city, the place where my ancestors are buried, is in ruins and its gates are burned down?”",
      "4": "“What do you want?” the king asked me.\nSo I prayed to the God of heaven,",
      "5": "and I asked the king, “If it pleases Your Majesty, and you are willing to grant my request, let me go to Judah, to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I can rebuild it.”",
      "6": "Then, while the queen was sitting beside him, the king asked me, “How long will you be gone, and when will you come back?” When I gave him a specific date, he was willing to let me go.",
      "7": "I also asked the king, “If it pleases Your Majesty, let me have letters addressed to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River. In the letters tell them to grant me safe conduct until I arrive in Judah.",
      "8": "Also, let me have a letter addressed to Asaph, the supervisor of Your Majesty’s forest. In the letter order him to give me wood for the gates of the fortress near the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I’ll move into.” (The king let me have the letters, because God was guiding me.)",
      "9": "I went to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River and gave them the king’s letters. (The king had sent army officers and cavalry to be with me.)",
      "10": "But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, they were very upset that someone had come to give the people of Israel so much assistance.",
      "11": "I went to Jerusalem and was there for three days.",
      "12": "During the night I went out with a few men without telling anyone what my God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I had was the one I was riding.",
      "13": "I went through Valley Gate that night toward Snake Fountain and Dung Gate and examined the places where the walls of Jerusalem were broken down and where its gates had been burned.",
      "14": "Passing through Fountain Gate, I arrived at King’s Pool, but the animal I was riding couldn’t get through.",
      "15": "So I went through the valley that night and examined the wall. Then I turned back, entered Valley Gate, and returned.",
      "16": "The officials didn’t know where I had gone or what I had done. I hadn’t yet told the Jews, the priests, the leaders, the other officials, or any of the rest who would be doing the work.",
      "17": "Then I told them, “You see the trouble we’re in. Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned down. Let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be insulted.”",
      "18": "Then I told them that my God had been guiding me and what the king had told me.\nThey replied, “Let’s begin to rebuild.” So they encouraged one another to begin this God-pleasing work.",
      "19": "When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they made fun of us and ridiculed us. They asked, “What are you doing? Are you going to rebel against the king?”",
      "20": "“The God of heaven will give us success,” I answered them. “We, his servants, are going to rebuild. You have no property or claim or historic right in Jerusalem.”"

      "1": "When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he became enraged and made fun of the Jews.",
      "2": "In front of his allies and the army from Samaria, he said, “What do these miserable Jews think they’re doing? Can they rebuild it by themselves? Are they going to offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Will they get the stones out of the rubbish heaps, burned as these stones are, and give them new strength?”",
      "3": "Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside Sanballat, said, “Even a fox would make their stone wall collapse if it walked on top of what they’re building!”",
      "4": "Nehemiah prayed, “Our God, hear us. We are despised. Turn their insults back on them, and let them be robbed in the land where they are prisoners.",
      "5": "Don’t ignore their guilt, and don’t let their sins disappear from your records. They have insulted you in front of these builders.”",
      "6": "So we rebuilt the wall, which was rebuilt to about half its original height. The people worked with determination.",
      "7": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from Ashdod heard that the repair work on the walls of Jerusalem was making progress and that the gaps were being filled in, they became furious.",
      "8": "All of them plotted to attack Jerusalem to create confusion.",
      "9": "But we prayed to our God and set guards to protect us day and night.",
      "10": "Then the people of Judah said, “The work crews are worn out, and there is too much rubble. We can’t continue to rebuild the wall.”",
      "11": "Our enemies said, “Before they know what is happening or see a thing, we will be right in the middle of them. We’ll kill them and bring the work to an end.”",
      "12": "Jews who were living near our enemies warned us ten times that our enemies would attack us from every direction.",
      "13": "That is why I positioned people by their families behind the wall where it was lowest and most exposed. The people were armed with swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "I looked them over and proceeded to tell the nobles, the leaders, and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and awe-inspiring the Lord is. Fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”",
      "15": "When our enemies heard that we knew about their plots and that God had prevented their plans from being successful, we all went back to the work on the wall. Each person performed his own job.",
      "16": "From that day on, half of my men worked on the wall, and the other half were wearing body armor and holding spears, shields, and bows. The leaders stood behind all the Judeans",
      "17": "who were rebuilding the wall. The workers who were carrying loads did the work with one hand and held their weapons with the other,",
      "18": "and each builder had his sword fastened to his side. The man who was supposed to sound the trumpet alarm was with me.",
      "19": "I told the nobles, the leaders, and the rest of the people, “So much work has to be done in different places that we are widely separated from one another on the wall.",
      "20": "When you hear the trumpet, assemble around me. Our God will fight for us!”",
      "21": "So we continued to work. Half of us held spears from early dawn until the stars came out.",
      "22": "At that time I told the people, “Every man and his servant should stay overnight in Jerusalem so that we can set a guard at night and work during the day.”",
      "23": "My brothers, my servants, and the guards assigned to me never changed their clothes. Neither did I. We each kept our weapons at hand."

      "1": "Then some of the people, the men and their wives, complained publicly about their Jewish relatives.",
      "2": "Some of them said, “We have large families! We need some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive.”",
      "3": "Others said, “We’ve had to mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our homes in order to get some grain because of this famine.”",
      "4": "Others said, “We’ve had to borrow money to pay the king’s taxes on our fields and vineyards.",
      "5": "We have the same flesh and blood as our relatives. Our children are just like theirs. Yet, we have to force our sons and daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already become slaves. But we can’t do anything else when our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "I became furious when I heard their complaint and what they had to say.",
      "7": "After thinking it over, I confronted the nobles and the leaders. I told them, “You are charging interest on loans made to your own relatives.” I arranged for a large meeting to deal with them.",
      "8": "Then I told them, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish relatives who had been sold to other nations. Now you are selling your Jewish relatives so that we have to buy them back again!” They were unable to say anything.",
      "9": "I added, “What you’re doing is wrong. Shouldn’t you live in the fear of our God to keep our enemies from ridiculing us?",
      "10": "My brothers, my servants, and I are lending money and grain to the poor. But we must stop charging them interest.",
      "11": "You must return their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their homes today. Also, you must return the interest on the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil you’ve been charging them.”",
      "12": "They responded, “We’ll return it and not try to get it from them again. We’ll do what you say.” Then I called the priests and made them swear to do what they promised.",
      "13": "I brushed off my clothes and said, “In the same way, may God brush off from home and work everyone who refuses to keep this promise. In the same way, may everyone be brushed off and left with nothing.” Then the whole congregation said amen and praised the Lord. The people did what they had promised.",
      "14": "During the 12 years that I was governor of Judah, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes’ reign to the thirty-second year of his reign, my brothers and I never ate any food that was paid for by the governor’s food allowance.",
      "15": "Those who were governors before me had made life difficult for the people by taking from them food and wine plus one pound of silver. Even the governors’ servants took advantage of their power over the people. But I didn’t do that, because I feared God.",
      "16": "Instead, I put my best effort into the work on this wall, and we bought no land. All my men gathered here for work.",
      "17": "I fed 150 Jewish leaders and their people who came to us from the surrounding nations.",
      "18": "Preparing one ox and six choice sheep was necessary every day. Poultry was prepared for me. Once every ten days a supply of wine was ordered. Yet, in spite of all this, I never demanded anything from the governor’s food allowance, because these people were already carrying a heavy load.",
      "19": "Remember me, my God. Consider everything that I have done for these people."

      "2": "Then Sanballat and Geshem sent this message to me: “Let’s meet in Hakkephirim on the plain of Ono.” They were planning to harm me.",
      "3": "I sent messengers to tell them, “I’m working on an important project and can’t get away. Why should the work stop while I leave to meet with you?”",
      "4": "They sent the same message to me four times, and I answered them the same way.",
      "5": "When Sanballat sent me the same message a fifth time, his servant held in his hand an unsealed letter.",
      "6": "In it was written:\nIt has been reported throughout the nations, and Geshem has confirmed it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel. That’s why you’re rebuilding the wall. According to this report, you want to become their king.",
      "7": "You’ve appointed prophets to announce about you in Jerusalem, ‘There’s a king in Judah!’ This report will get back to the king. So let’s talk about this.",
      "8": "Then I sent someone to tell him, “None of your accusations are true. You are making them up out of your own imagination.”",
      "9": "They were all trying to intimidate us. They thought we would give up and not finish the work.\nBut God made me strong.",
      "10": "One day I went to the home of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. Shemaiah who was confined to his house, said, “Let’s meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and close the temple doors. Some men are coming at night to kill you.”",
      "11": "But I asked, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple to save his life? I won’t go.”",
      "12": "Then I realized that God hadn’t sent him. Instead, Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to prophesy against me.",
      "13": "He was hired to intimidate me into doing this so that I would sin. Then they could give me a bad reputation in order to discredit me.",
      "14": "Nehemiah prayed, “My God, remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Also, remember the female prophet Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.”",
      "15": "The wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul. The wall took 52 days to finish.",
      "16": "When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence. They realized we had done this work with the help of our God.",
      "17": "In those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah sent many letters back to them.",
      "18": "Many in Judah had promised to support Tobiah because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, Arah’s son. In addition, Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, Berechiah’s son.",
      "19": "The nobles were singing Tobiah’s praises to me and reporting to him what I said. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me."

      "3": "I told them, “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened at the hottest time of the day. While the gatekeepers are still standing there, they should shut the doors and bar them. Order some of the men in Jerusalem to stand guard, some at their posts and others in front of their homes.”",
      "4": "The city was large and wide-open. Few people were in it, and no houses were being built.",

The people of Judah were pleased with the ministry of the priests and Levites.",
