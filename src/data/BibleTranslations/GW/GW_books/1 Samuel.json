      "1": "There was a man named Elkanah from Ramathaim Zophim in the mountains of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, grandson of Elihu, great-grandson of Tohu, whose father was Zuph from the tribe of Ephraim.",
      "2": "Elkanah had two wives, one named Hannah, the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.",
      "3": "Every year this man would go from his own city to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of Armies at Shiloh. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, served there as priests of the Lord.",
      "4": "Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he would give portions of it to his wife Peninnah and all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "He would also give one portion to Hannah because he loved her, even though the Lord had kept her from having children.",
      "6": "Because the Lord had made her unable to have children, her rival Peninnah tormented her endlessly in order to make her miserable.",
      "7": "This happened year after year. Whenever Hannah went to the Lord’s house, Peninnah would make her miserable, and Hannah would cry and not eat.",
      "8": "Her husband Elkanah would ask her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why haven’t you eaten? Why are you so downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "One day, after Hannah had something to eat and drink in Shiloh, she got up. (The priest Eli was sitting on a chair by the door of the Lord’s temple.)",
      "10": "Though she was resentful, she prayed to the Lord while she cried.",
      "11": "She made this vow, “Lord of Armies, if you will look at my misery, remember me, and give me a boy, then I will give him to you for as long as he lives. A razor will never be used on his head.”",
      "12": "While Hannah was praying a long time in front of the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "She was praying silently. Her voice couldn’t be heard; only her lips were moving. Eli thought she was drunk.",
      "14": "“How long are you going to stay drunk?” Eli asked her. “Get rid of your wine.”",
      "15": "Hannah responded, “No sir. I’m not drunk. I’m depressed. I’m pouring out my heart to the Lord.",
      "16": "Don’t take me to be a good-for-nothing woman. I was praying like this because I’ve been troubled and tormented.”",
      "17": "Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request.”",
      "18": "“May you continue to be kind to me,” she said. Then the woman went her way and ate. She was no longer sad.",
      "19": "Early in the morning Elkanah and his family got up and worshiped in front of the Lord. Then they returned home to Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her.",
      "20": "Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel [God Hears], because she said, “I asked the Lord for him.”",
      "21": "To keep his vow, Elkanah and his entire household again went to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord.",
      "22": "But Hannah didn’t go. She told her husband, “I’ll wait until the boy is weaned. Then I’ll bring him and present him to the Lord, and he’ll stay there permanently.”",
      "23": "“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Wait until you’ve weaned him. May the Lord keep his word.” The woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
      "24": "As soon as she had weaned Samuel, she took him with her. She also brought a three-year-old bull, half a bushel of flour, and a full wineskin. She brought him to the Lord’s house at Shiloh while the boy was still a child.",
      "25": "Then the parents butchered the bull and brought the child to Eli.",
      "26": "“Sir,” Hannah said, “as sure as you live, I’m the woman who stood here next to you and prayed to the Lord.",
      "27": "I prayed for this child, and the Lord granted my request.",
      "28": "In return, I am giving him to the Lord. He will be dedicated to the Lord for his whole life.”\nAnd they worshiped the Lord there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Hannah prayed out loud,\n“My heart finds joy in the Lord.\nMy head is lifted to the Lord.\nMy mouth mocks my enemies.\nI rejoice because you saved me.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like the Lord.\nThere is no one but you, O Lord.\nThere is no Rock like our God.",
      "3": "“Do not boast\nor let arrogance come out of your mouth\nbecause the Lord is a God of knowledge,\nand he weighs our actions.",
      "4": "“The bows of the warriors are broken,\nbut those who stumble are armed with strength.",
      "5": "Those who were well-fed hire themselves out for a piece of bread,\nbut those who were hungry hunger no more.\nEven the woman who was childless gives birth to seven children,\nbut the mother of many children grieves all alone.",
      "6": "“The Lord kills, and he gives life.\nHe makes people go down to the grave, and he raises them up again.",
      "7": "The Lord causes poverty and grants wealth.\nHe humbles people; he also promotes them.",
      "8": "He raises the poor from the dust.\nHe lifts the needy from the trash heap\nin order to make them sit with nobles\nand even to make them inherit a glorious throne. \n“The pillars of the earth are the Lord’s.\nHe has set the world on them.",
      "9": "He safeguards the steps of his faithful ones,\nbut wicked people are silenced in darkness\nbecause humans cannot succeed by their own strength.",
      "10": "“Those who oppose the Lord are broken into pieces.\nHe thunders at them from the heavens.\nThe Lord judges the ends of the earth.\nHe gives strength to his King\nand lifts the head of his Messiah.”",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. But the boy Samuel served the Lord under the priest Eli.",
      "12": "Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were good-for-nothing priests; they had no faith in the Lord.",
      "13": "Now, this was how the priests dealt with the people who were offering sacrifices: While the meat was boiling, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.",
      "14": "Then he would stick it into the pot, kettle, cauldron, or pan. Whatever the fork brought up from the pot belonged to the priest. This is what the priests did in Shiloh to all the people of Israel who came there to sacrifice.",
      "15": "But in the case of Eli’s sons, even before the people burned the fat, their servants would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the meat to the priest to roast. He doesn’t want boiled meat from you. He wants it raw.”",
      "16": "If the man said to the servant, “First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you want,” the servant would say to him, “Give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.”",
      "17": "The sin of Eli’s sons was a serious matter to the Lord, because these men were treating the offerings made to the Lord with contempt.",
      "18": "Meanwhile, Samuel continued to serve in front of the Lord. As a boy he was already wearing a linen ephod.",
      "19": "His mother would make him a robe and bring it to him every year when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.",
      "20": "Eli would bless Elkanah (and his wife) and say, “May the Lord give you children from this woman in place of the one which she has given to the Lord.” Then they would go home.",
      "21": "The Lord came to Hannah. She became pregnant five times and had three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in front of the Lord.",
      "22": "Now, Eli was very old, and he had heard everything that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were sleeping with the women who served at the gate of the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "So he asked them, “Why are you doing such things? I hear about your wicked ways from all these people.",
      "24": "Sons, the report that I hear the people of the Lord spreading isn’t good!",
      "25": "If one person sins against another, God will take care of him. However, when a person sins against the Lord, who will pray for him?” But they wouldn’t listen to their father’s warning—the Lord wanted to kill them.",
      "26": "The boy Samuel continued to grow and gained the favor of the Lord and the people.",
      "27": "Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: I revealed myself to your ancestors when they were under Pharaoh’s control in Egypt.",
      "28": "I chose one of your ancestors out of all the tribes of Israel to serve as my priest, to sacrifice burnt offerings on my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the ephod in my presence. And I gave your ancestors the right to keep portions of the sacrifices that the people of Israel burned on the altar.",
      "29": "Why do you show no respect for my sacrifices and grain offerings that I have commanded people to make in my dwelling place? Why do you honor your sons more than me by making yourselves fat on the best of all the sacrifices offered by my people Israel?",
      "30": "“Therefore, the Lord God of Israel declares: I certainly thought that your family and your father’s family would always live in my presence.\n“But now the Lord declares: I promise that I will honor those who honor me, and those who despise me will be considered insignificant.",
      "31": "The time is coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s house so that no one will grow old in your family.",
      "32": "You will see distress in my dwelling place. In spite of the good that I do for Israel, no one in your family will live to an old age.",
      "33": "Any man in your family whom I do not remove from my altar will have his eyes fail, and he  will be heartbroken. And all your descendants will die in the prime of life.",
      "34": "What is going to happen to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you: Both of them will die on the same day.",
      "35": "Then I will appoint a faithful priest to serve me. He will do everything I want him to do. I will give him faithful descendants, and he will always live as my anointed one.",
      "36": "Then anyone who is left from your household will bow down in front of him to get a coin or a loaf of bread and say, ‘Please appoint me to one of the priestly classes so that I may eat a piece of bread.’ ”"

      "1": "The boy Samuel was serving the Lord under Eli. In those days a prophecy from the Lord was rare; visions were infrequent.",
      "2": "One night Eli was lying down in his room. His eyesight had begun to fail so that he couldn’t see well.",
      "3": "The lamp in God’s temple  hadn’t gone out yet, and Samuel was asleep in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was kept.",
      "4": "Then the Lord called Samuel. “Here I am,” Samuel responded.",
      "5": "He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\n“I didn’t call you,” Eli replied. “Go back to bed.” So Samuel went back and lay down.",
      "6": "The Lord called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\n“I didn’t call you, son,” he responded. “Go back to bed.”",
      "7": "Samuel had no experience with the Lord, because the Lord’s word had not yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "The Lord called Samuel a third time. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\nThen Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.",
      "9": "“Go, lie down,” Eli told Samuel. “When he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord. I’m listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his room.",
      "10": "The Lord came and stood there. He called as he had called the other times: “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel replied, “Speak. I’m listening.”",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to Samuel, “I am going to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it ring.",
      "12": "On that day I am going to do to Eli and his family everything I said from beginning to end.",
      "13": "I told him that I would hand down a permanent judgment against his household because he knew about his sons’ sin—that they were cursing God —but he didn’t try to stop them.",
      "14": "That is why I have taken an oath concerning Eli’s family line: No offering or sacrifice will ever be able to make peace for the sins that Eli’s family committed.”",
      "15": "Samuel remained in bed until morning. Then he opened the doors of the Lord’s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.",
      "16": "Then Eli called Samuel. “Samuel, my son!” he said.\n“Here I am,” he responded.",
      "17": "“What did the Lord tell you?” he asked. “Please don’t hide anything from me. May God strike you dead if you hide anything he told you from me.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told Eli everything.\nEli replied, “He is the Lord. May he do what he thinks is right.”",
      "19": "Samuel grew up. The Lord was with him and didn’t let any of his words go unfulfilled.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew Samuel was the Lord’s appointed prophet.",
      "21": "The Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, since the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the Lord’s word. And Samuel spoke to all Israel."

      "1": "Israel went to fight against the Philistines and camped near Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines organized their troops to meet Israel in battle. As the battle spread, the Philistines defeated Israel and killed about 4,000 soldiers in the field.",
      "3": "When the troops came back to the camp, the leaders of Israel asked, “Why has the Lord used the Philistines to defeat us today? Let’s get the ark of the Lord’s promise from Shiloh so that he may be with us and save us from our enemies.”",
      "4": "The troops sent some men who brought back the ark of the promise of the Lord of Armies—who is enthroned over the angels. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, came along with God’s ark.",
      "5": "When the Lord’s ark came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth rang with echoes.",
      "6": "As the Philistines heard the noise, they asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?” The Philistines found out that the Lord’s ark had come into the camp.",
      "7": "Then they were frightened and said, “A god has come into their camp.” They also said, “Oh no! Nothing like this has ever happened before.",
      "8": "We’re in trouble now! Who can save us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every kind of plague in the desert.",
      "9": "Be strong, Philistines, and act like men, or else you will serve the Hebrews as they served you. Act like men and fight.”",
      "10": "The Philistines fought and defeated Israel. Every Israelite soldier fled to his tent. It was a major defeat in which 30,000 Israelite foot soldiers died.",
      "11": "The ark of God was captured. Both of Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the front line of the battle. He went to Shiloh that day with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.",
      "13": "When he arrived, Eli was sitting on a chair beside the road, watching. He was worried about the ark of God. The man went into the city to tell the news. The whole city cried out.",

      "4": "But the next morning they saw that Dagon had again fallen forward on the ground in front of the Lord’s ark. Dagon’s head and his two hands were cut off and were lying on the temple’s threshold. The rest of Dagon’s body was intact.",
      "5": "This is why the priests of Dagon and everyone else who comes into Dagon’s temple in Ashdod still don’t step on the temple’s threshold.",
      "6": "The Lord dealt harshly with the people of Ashdod. He destroyed them by striking the people in the vicinity of Ashdod with tumors.",

      "8": "The people of Ashdod called together all the Philistine rulers. “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” they asked.\n“The ark of the God of Israel must be taken to Gath,” the rulers said. So the people took the ark of the God of Israel there.",

      "10": "So the people of Gath sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill us.”",
      "11": "They called together all the Philistine rulers. “Send the ark of the God of Israel away,” they said. “Let it go back to its own place so that it won’t kill us or our people.” There was a fear of death throughout the city, where God dealt with them very harshly.",

      "3": "The priests answered, “If you’re returning the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it away empty, but by all means return it to its proper place with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will know why he would not turn his anger away from you.”",
      "4": "The Philistines asked, “What kind of guilt offering should we give him?”\nThe priests answered, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice for the five Philistine rulers because all of you and your rulers suffer from the same plague.",

      "2": "He had a son named Saul, a handsome, young man. No man in Israel was more handsome than Saul. He stood a head taller than everyone else.",
      "3": "When some donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, Kish told Saul, “Take one of the servants with you, and go look for the donkeys.”",
      "4": "They went through the mountains of Ephraim and the region of Shalisha without finding the donkeys. Then Saul and his servant went through the region of Shaalim, but the donkeys weren’t there. The men went through the territory of Benjamin but still didn’t find them.",
      "5": "When they came to the territory of Zuph, Saul told his servant who was with him, “Let’s go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and worry about us instead.”",
      "6": "The servant responded, “There’s a man of God in this city, a highly respected man. Everything he says is sure to happen. Let’s go there. Maybe he’ll tell us which way we should go.”",
      "7": "“If we go,” Saul asked his servant, “what could we bring the man since the food in our sacks is gone? There’s no present we can bring the man of God. What do we have?”",
      "8": "The servant again answered Saul, “Look, here! I have one-tenth of an ounce of silver. I’ll give it to the man of God. Then he’ll tell us where to find the donkeys.”",
      "9": "(Formerly in Israel, when a person went to ask God a question, he would say, “Come, let’s go to the seer,” because a person we now call a prophet used to be called a seer.)",

      "11": "As they were going up the hill to the city, they met girls coming out to get water. They asked the girls, “Is the seer here?”",
      "12": "The girls answered, “He’s there ahead of you. Hurry! He just went into the city today since the people are offering a sacrifice on the worship site.",
      "13": "As you go into the city, you can find him before he goes to the worship site to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, since he blesses the sacrifice. Then those who are invited may eat. Go. You should be able to find him now.”",
      "14": "So Saul and his servant went to the city. As they entered it, Samuel was coming toward them on his way to the worship site.",
      "15": "Now, the Lord had revealed the following message to Samuel one day before Saul came:",
      "16": "“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the territory of Benjamin. Anoint him to be ruler of my people Israel. He will save my people from the Philistines because I’ve seen my people’s suffering and their cry has come to me.”",

      "20": "Don’t trouble yourself about the donkeys that were lost three days ago because they’ve been found. Who will have all that is desirable in Israel? Won’t it be you and your father’s family?”",
      "21": "Saul replied, “I am a man from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe of Israel. My family is the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin. So why are you saying such things to me?”",
      "22": "Samuel brought Saul and his servant to the banquet hall and had them sit at the head of the guests—about 30 people.",
      "23": "Samuel said to the cook, “Bring me the portion of the sacrificial meat that I gave you and told you to put aside.”",
      "24": "So the cook picked up the leg and thigh and laid it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “This was kept in order to be laid in front of you. Eat it. When I invited people to the feast, I set it aside for you.” Saul ate with Samuel that day.",

      "2": "When you leave me today, two men will be at Rachel’s grave on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They’ll tell you, ‘We’ve found the donkeys you went looking for. Your father no longer cares about them. Instead, he’s worried about you. He keeps asking, “What can I do to find my son?” ’",
      "3": "Keep going until you come to the oak tree at Tabor. There you will find three men on their way to worship God at Bethel: One will be carrying three young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a full wineskin.",
      "4": "They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you should accept from them.",
      "5": "After that, you will come to the hill of God, where the Philistines have a military post. When you arrive at the city, you will meet a group of prophets prophesying as they come from the worship site. They will be led by men playing a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre.",

      "9": "When Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s attitude. That day all these signs happened.",
      "10": "When Saul came to the hill, a group of prophets came to meet him, and God’s Spirit came over him. He prophesied with them.",
      "11": "When all who had known him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets?”",
      "12": "But a man from that place asked, “But who’s the chief prophet?” So it became a proverb: “Is Saul one of the prophets?”",
      "13": "And when he had finished prophesying, he came to the worship site.",
      "14": "Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?”\nSaul answered, “To look for the donkeys, and when we couldn’t find them, we went to Samuel.”",
      "15": "Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”",
      "16": "“He assured us the donkeys had been found,” Saul answered his uncle. But Saul didn’t tell him what Samuel said about his becoming king.",
      "17": "Samuel called the people to come into the presence of the Lord at Mizpah.",
      "18": "He said to the Israelites, “This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I brought Israel out of Egypt and rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and all the kings who were oppressing you.",
      "19": "But now you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and distresses. You said, ‘No! Place a king over us.’ Now then, stand in front of the Lord by your tribes and family groups.”",
      "20": "When Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.",
      "21": "When he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by families, the family of Matri was chosen. Then Saul, the son of Kish, was chosen. They looked for him but couldn’t find him.",
      "22": "They asked the Lord again, “Has he arrived here yet?”\nThe Lord answered, “He’s hiding among the baggage.”",
      "23": "They ran and got him from there. As he stood among the people, he was a head taller than everyone else.",
      "24": "Samuel asked the people, “Do you see whom the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.”\nThen all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”",
      "25": "Samuel explained the laws concerning kingship to the people. He wrote the laws on a scroll, which he placed in front of the Lord. Then Samuel sent the people back to their homes.",
      "26": "Saul also went home to Gibeah. With him went some soldiers whose hearts God had touched.",

However, seven thousand men had escaped from the Ammonites and gone to Jabesh Gilead. About a month later  Nahash the Ammonite blockaded Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we’ll serve you.”",

      "9": "They told the messengers who had come, “This is what you are to say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun gets hot, you will be rescued.’ ” When the men of Jabesh received the message, they were overjoyed.",

      "4": "Jonathan said to David, “I’ll do whatever you say.”",
      "5": "David replied, “Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, when I should sit and eat at the king’s table. But let me go and hide in the countryside for two more nights.",
      "6": "If your father really misses me, tell him, ‘David repeatedly begged me to let him run to Bethlehem, his hometown, because his relatives are offering the annual sacrifice there.’",
      "7": "If he says, ‘Good!’ then I will be safe. But if he gets really angry, then you’ll know for sure that he has decided to harm me.",
      "8": "Now, be kind to me. After all, you forced me into an agreement with the Lord. If I have committed any crime, kill me yourself. Why bother taking me to your father?”",
      "9": "Jonathan answered, “That’s unthinkable! If I knew for sure that my father had decided to harm you, I would have told you about it.”",
      "10": "Then David asked, “Who will tell me whether or not your father gives you a harsh answer?”",
      "11": "Jonathan said, “Let’s go out into the country.” So they went out into the country.",
      "12": "“As the Lord God of Israel is my witness,” Jonathan continued, “I’ll find out in the next two or three days how my father feels about you. If he does feel kindly toward you, then I will send someone to tell you.",
      "13": "If my father plans to harm you and I fail to tell you and send you away safely, may the Lord harm me even more. May the Lord be with you as he used to be with my father.",
      "14": "But as long as I live, promise me that you will show me kindness because of the Lord. And even when I die,",
      "15": "never stop being kind to my family. The Lord will wipe each of David’s enemies off the face of the earth.",

      "18": "“Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival,” Jonathan told him, “and you will be missed when your seat is empty.",
      "19": "The day after tomorrow you will be missed even more. So go to the place where you hid on that other occasion, and stay by the rock.",
      "20": "I will shoot three arrows from beside it toward a target.",
      "21": "Then I will send out a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ Now, if I tell the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are next to you; get them,’ then come back with me. You will be safe, and there will be no trouble. I swear it, as the Lord lives.",
      "22": "But if I tell the boy, ‘The arrows are next to you,’ then go, because the Lord has sent you away.",
      "23": "We have made a promise to each other, and the Lord is a witness between you and me forever.”",
      "24": "So David hid in the countryside. When the New Moon Festival came, King Saul sat down to eat the festival meal.",
      "25": "He sat in his usual seat by the wall, while Jonathan stood. Abner sat beside Saul, but David’s place was empty.",
      "26": "Saul didn’t say anything that day, thinking, “Something has happened to him so that he’s unclean. He must be unclean.”",
      "27": "But on the second day of the month, David’s place was still empty.\nSaul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal either yesterday or today?”",
      "28": "Jonathan answered Saul, “David repeatedly begged me to let him go to Bethlehem.",
      "29": "David said to me ‘Please let me go. Our relatives will offer a sacrifice in the city, and my brother ordered me to be there. If you will permit it, please let me go to see my brothers.’ This is why he hasn’t come to your banquet.”",
      "30": "Then Saul got angry with Jonathan. “Son of a crooked and rebellious woman!” he called Jonathan. “I know you’ve sided with Jesse’s son. You have no shame. You act as if you are your mother’s son but not mine.",
      "31": "As long as Jesse’s son lives on earth, neither you nor your right to be king is secure. Now, send some men to bring him to me. He’s a dead man!”",
      "32": "Jonathan asked his father, “Why should he be killed? What has he done?”",
      "33": "Saul raised his spear to strike him. Then Jonathan knew his father was determined to kill David.",
      "34": "Jonathan got up from the table very angry and ate nothing that second day of the month. He was worried sick about David because Jonathan had been humiliated by his own father.",
      "35": "In the morning Jonathan went out to the country to the place he and David had agreed on. Jonathan had a young boy with him.",
      "36": "“Run,” he told the boy, “please find the arrows I shoot.”\nThe boy ran, and Jonathan shot the arrow over him.",
      "37": "When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had landed, Jonathan called after him, “The arrows are next to you!”",
      "38": "Jonathan added, “Quick! Hurry up! Don’t stand there!” Jonathan’s young servant gathered the arrows and came to his master.",
      "39": "The boy had no idea what was going on, but Jonathan and David understood.",
      "40": "Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy. He told the boy, “Take them back into town.”",
      "41": "When the boy had left, David came out from the south side of the rock and quickly bowed down three times with his face touching the ground. Then they kissed each other and cried together, but David cried the loudest.",
      "42": "“Go in peace!” Jonathan told David. “We have both taken an oath in the Lord’s name, saying, ‘The Lord will be a witness between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’ ” \nSo David left, and Jonathan went into the city."

      "4": "David sent spies to confirm that Saul had arrived.",
      "5": "Then David went to the place where Saul had camped. David saw the place where Saul and Ner’s son Abner, the commander of the army, were lying. Saul was lying in the camp, and the troops were camped around him.",
      "6": "David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai, who was Zeruiah’s son and Joab’s brother, “Who will go with me to Saul in the camp?”\nAbishai answered, “I’ll go with you.”",
      "7": "So David and Abishai went among Saul’s troops that night. Saul was lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.",
      "8": "Abishai said to David, “Today God has turned your enemy over to you. Please let me nail him to the ground with one stab of the spear. I won’t have to do it twice!”",
      "9": "“Don’t kill him!” David told Abishai. “No one has ever attacked the Lord’s anointed king and remained free of guilt.",
      "10": "I solemnly swear, as the Lord lives,” David added, “the Lord will strike him. Either his time will come when he’ll die naturally, or he’ll go into battle and be swept away.",
      "11": "It would be unthinkable for me to attack the Lord’s anointed king. But please take that spear near his head and that jar of water, and let’s go.”",
      "12": "David took the spear and the jar of water near Saul’s head, and they left. All of them were asleep. No one saw them, knew about it, or woke up. The Lord had made them fall into a deep sleep.",
      "13": "David went over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away. (There was a wide space between them.)",
      "14": "Then David called to the troops and to Ner’s son Abner. “Won’t you answer, Abner?” he asked.\n“Who is calling the king?” Abner asked.",
      "15": "David asked Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Is there anyone like you in Israel? Then why didn’t you guard your master, the king? Someone came to kill His Royal Majesty.",
      "16": "What you’ve done isn’t good. I solemnly swear, as the Lord lives, you are dead men. You didn’t guard your master, the Lord’s anointed king. Look at the king’s spear and the jar of water that were near his head.”",
      "17": "Saul recognized David’s voice. “Is that your voice, my servant David?” he asked.\n“It is my voice, Your Royal Majesty,” David answered.",
      "18": "“Why are you pursuing me?” he added. “What have I done? What crime have I committed?",
      "19": "Your Majesty, please listen to my words. If the Lord has turned you against me, let him be satisfied with an offering. But if mere mortals have turned you against me, let them be cursed by the Lord. They have prevented me from having a share of the Lord’s inheritance. ‘Go and serve other gods,’ they tell me.",
      "20": "Don’t let my blood fall to the ground, away from the Lord’s presence. The king of Israel has come to search for one flea like someone hunting a partridge in the hills.”",
      "21": "“My servant David,” Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back. I will not harm you again, because you valued my life today. I’ve acted like a fool and made a terrible mistake.”",
      "22": "David responded, “Here’s the king’s spear. One of the young men should come over and get it.",
      "23": "The Lord will reward any person who is righteous and faithful. The Lord handed you over to me today, but I refused to attack the Lord’s anointed king.",
      "24": "As I placed great value on your life today, may the Lord place great value on my life and rescue me from all trouble.”",
      "25": "Then Saul said, “Blessed are you, my servant David. You will accomplish many things and certainly will succeed.”\nSo David went his way, while Saul returned home."

      "1": "David said to himself, “One of these days Saul will sweep me away. The best thing for me to do is to make sure that I escape to Philistine territory. Then Saul will give up looking all over Israel for me, and I’ll escape from him.”",
      "2": "So David went with his 600 men to King Achish of Gath, Moach’s son.",
      "3": "David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each one had his family, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel.",
      "4": "When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he didn’t search for him anymore.",
      "5": "David said to Achish, “If you will permit me, let me have a place in one of the outlying towns so that I can live there. Why should I live in the royal city with you?”",
      "6": "So Achish immediately gave him Ziklag. (This is why Ziklag still belongs to the kings of Judah today.)",
      "7": "David stayed in Philistine territory for one year and four months.",

      "10": "Achish would ask, “Whom did you raid today?” \nAnd David would answer, “the Negev in Judah,” or “the portion of the Negev where the descendants of Jerahmeel live,” or “the portion of the Negev where the Kenites live.”",
      "11": "He did not bring a single man or woman back to Gath alive. He thought, “They could tell Achish what I really did.” This was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.",
      "12": "And Achish believed David. Achish thought, “He has definitely made his own people in Israel despise him. He’ll be my servant from now on.”"

      "10": "But Saul took an oath in the Lord’s name, “I solemnly swear, as the Lord lives, you will not be harmed if you do this.”",
      "11": "“Whom should I conjure up for you?” the woman asked.\n“Conjure up Samuel for me,” he answered.",
      "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly and asked, “Why did you deceive me? You’re Saul!”",
      "13": "“Don’t be afraid,” the king said to her. “What do you see?”\n“I see a god rising from the ground,” the woman answered.",
      "14": "“In what form?” he asked her.\nShe answered, “An old man is coming up, and he’s wearing a robe.” Then Saul knew it was Samuel. Saul knelt down with his face touching the ground.",
      "15": "Samuel asked Saul, “Why did you disturb me by conjuring me up?”\nSaul answered, “I’m in serious trouble. The Philistines are at war with me, and God has turned against me and doesn’t answer me anymore—either by the prophets or in dreams. So I’ve called on you to tell me what to do.”",
      "16": "Samuel said, “Why are you asking me when the Lord has turned against you and become your enemy?",
      "17": "The Lord has done to you exactly what he spoke through me: The Lord has torn the kingship out of your hands and given it to your fellow Israelite David.",
      "18": "The Lord is doing this to you today because you didn’t listen to him or unleash his burning anger on Amalek.",
      "19": "For the same reasons the Lord will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And then the Lord will hand Israel’s army over to the Philistines.”",
      "20": "Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was frightened by Samuel’s words. He also had no strength left, because he hadn’t eaten anything all day or all night.",
      "21": "The woman came over to Saul and saw that he was terrified. “I listened to you,” she told him, “and I took my life in my hands when I did what you told me to do.",
      "22": "Now please listen to me. I will serve you something to eat. Eat it so that you will have strength when you leave.”",
      "23": "But he refused. “I don’t want to eat,” he said. Nevertheless, his officers and the woman kept urging  him until he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.",
      "24": "The woman immediately butchered a fattened calf that she owned. She took flour, kneaded it, and baked some unleavened bread.",

      "4": "But the Philistine officers were angry with Achish. “Send the man back,” the Philistine officers told him. “Return him to the place you assigned him. He shouldn’t go with us into battle. He shouldn’t be allowed to become our enemy during the battle. Is this man going to try to regain his master’s favor? He’ll do it with the lives of our men!",

      "7": "So leave peacefully without doing anything to displease the Philistine rulers.”",
