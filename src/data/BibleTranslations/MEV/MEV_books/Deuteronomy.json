      "3": "In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him to give to them.",
      "4": "It was after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived at Ashtaroth in Edrei.",
      "5": "Across the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying:",
      "6": "The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, “You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.",
      "7": "Turn, and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors, in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the Negev and by the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.",

      "11": "May the Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times more numerous and bless you, just as He has promised you!",
      "12": "How can I myself bear your load and your burden and your strife?",
      "13": "Choose wise, discerning, and knowing men, among your tribes, and I will appoint them as leaders over you.”",
      "14": "You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have said is good for us to do.”",
      "15": "So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and well-known men, and appointed them as leaders over you, leaders over thousands, and leaders over hundreds, and leaders over fifties, and leaders over tens, and officers among your tribes.",

      "41": "Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.” So each of you girded on his weapons of war and you thought it easy to go up into the hill country.",
      "42": "Then the Lord said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.’ ”",
      "43": "So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead, you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord and went presumptuously up into the hill country.",
      "44": "The Amorites, who lived in the hill country, came out against you, and chased you as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir as far as Hormah.",
      "45": "Then you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would neither listen to your voice nor give ear to you.",

      "14": "Now the length of time it took for us to come to Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from among the army, just as the Lord swore to them.",
      "15": "For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among their midst, until they were gone.",

      "21": "They were a great people, as numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites. Then they dispossessed them and lived in their place,",
      "22": "just as He had done for the children of Esau, who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them, and lived in their place even to this day.",

      "27": "“Let me pass through your land. I will only go on the main road. I will not turn aside to the right or the left.",
      "28": "You shall sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only allow me to pass through on foot,",
      "29": "just as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.”",
      "30": "But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him, for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, so that He might deliver him into your hand as he is to this day.",
      "31": "The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to possess it, so that you may inherit his land.”",
