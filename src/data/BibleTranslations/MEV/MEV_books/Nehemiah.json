      "1": "The words of Nehemiah the son of Hakaliah.\nIn the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the palace,",
      "2": "Hanani, one of my relatives, and some men of Judah arrived. So I asked them concerning the returning Jews who had been in captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They said to me, “The remnant that returned from captivity is there in the province enduring great affliction and reproach. Also, the wall of Jerusalem remains broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days. Then I fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,",
      "5": "and said:\n“I beseech You, O Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy for those who love Him and keep His commandments.",
      "6": "Let Your ear now be attentive, and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant, which I now pray before You, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned.",
      "7": "We have acted very corruptly against You and have not obeyed the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which You commanded Your servant Moses.",
      "8": "“Please remember the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you behave unfaithfully, then I will scatter you among the nations,",
      "9": "but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though your outcasts are under the farthest part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and bring them back to the place where I have chosen to establish My name.’",
      "10": "“Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.",
      "11": "O Lord, I implore You, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. And let Your servant prosper this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”\nFor I was the king’s cupbearer."

      "1": "In the month of Nisan, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. Never had I been upset in his presence.",
      "2": "So the king said to me, “Why is your face troubled though you do not seem sick? This is nothing but a troubled heart.”\nThen I became very much afraid",
      "3": "and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should not my face be troubled when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”",
      "4": "So the king said to me, “What are you requesting about this matter?”\nImmediately, I prayed to the God of heaven",
      "5": "and then said to the king, “If this pleases the king and if this might be good for your servant who is before you, then would you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs so that I may rebuild it?”",
      "6": "The king, with the queen sitting beside him, said to me, “How long would your journey be? And when will you return?” Because it pleased the king to send me, I established a timetable for him.",
      "7": "I further said to the king, “If this pleases the king, may letters be given to me for the governors of the province Beyond the River so that they would allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,",
      "8": "as well as a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple mount, for the city wall, and for the house into which I will enter.” The king granted me these things, because the good hand of my God was upon me.",
      "9": "When I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, I gave them the king’s letters. He also sent with me commanders of foot and horse soldiers.",
      "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite subordinate heard this, it deeply grieved them that there was a man coming to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.",
      "11": "When I arrived in Jerusalem, I was there three days.",
      "12": "Then I arose in the night, I and a few men who were with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me, except the one on which I rode.",
      "13": "So I went out by night by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and then to the Dung Gate, because I was inspecting the broken-down walls of Jerusalem and its burned gates.",
      "14": "Next I passed by the Fountain Gate and then to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.",
      "15": "By going up along the riverbed at night, I inspected the wall. Then I turned back so that I could enter by the Valley Gate, and then came back again.",
      "16": "The officials did not know where I went or what I did, since I had not yet told it to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or to any of the others who would do the work.",
      "17": "Finally, I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem is devastated and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no more be a reproach.”",
      "18": "Then I told them that the hand of my God had been good to me and also about the king’s words that he had spoken to me.\nAnd they said, “Let us rise up and build!” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.",
      "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite subordinate, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”",
      "20": "Then answered I them and said to them, “The God of heaven, He will enable us to prosper. Therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you will have no portion, or right, or memorial in Jerusalem.”"

      "1": "When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly irritated, and he mocked the Jews.",
      "2": "He spoke before his relatives and the army of Samaria and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they fortifying themselves? Will they make sacrifices? Can they complete this in a day? Can they revive the burned-up stones out of the rubbish heaps?”",
      "3": "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Even what they are rebuilding, if even a fox climbed it, that would break down their stone wall.”",
      "4": "Hear, O our God, that we are despised. Turn their reproach back upon their own head, and give them as spoil in a land of captivity:",
      "5": "No longer cover their iniquity nor blot out their sin, which is before You since they have made insults against the builders.",
      "6": "So we rebuilt the wall until all of it was solidified up to half its height. The people had a passion for the work.",
      "7": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard how the restoration of Jerusalem’s walls was progressing and how the breaches had begun to be sealed, it made them extremely furious.",
      "8": "So they all conspired together to fight against Jerusalem in order to cause it chaos.",
      "9": "Nevertheless we prayed to our God, and, because of them, we set up a watch for them day and night.",
      "10": "Judah had said, “The strength of the burden bearers is failing though there is much rubble. And we ourselves are unable to rebuild the wall.”",
      "11": "Our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see until we have entered in among them and slain them. Indeed, we will stop the work!”",
      "12": "When the Jews living near them came, they told us ten times, “From every place where you turn, they will be against us.”",
      "13": "Therefore I set guards at the lowest positions along the wall and just inside the wall at the unrepaired areas. I also stationed the people by families providing them individually their own swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "After I looked around, I stood up and said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “Stop being terrified because of them! Remember instead that the Lord is great and awesome. So fight for each other—and for your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”",
      "15": "Now when our enemies heard that this had become known to us and that God had brought their counsel to nothing, then we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work.",
      "16": "After that day, half of my servants did the work while the other half handled the spears, shields, bows, and body armor. Commanders were appointed to support every house of Judah.",
      "17": "Those rebuilding the wall and those hauling the loads were working with one hand doing the task, but with the other hand holding the weapon.",
      "18": "For the builders, everyone had his sword bound to his side, even while rebuilding. The trumpet blower worked beside me.",
      "19": "I said to the nobles, the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “The work is vast and over a large area. Since we are spread along the wall far from each other,",
      "20": "assemble to us there at the place where you hear the trumpet sounded. Our God shall fight for us.”",
      "21": "So we labored in the work with half of them holding spears from sunrise to the rising of the stars.",
      "22": "Likewise at the same time I said to the people, “Every man and his servant must lodge within Jerusalem. By night, they may be a guard to us; by day, a laborer for the work.”",
      "23": "So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing."

      "1": "Now there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.",
      "2": "Some were saying, “We and our sons and our daughters are many. Therefore, let us acquire grain so that we may eat and live.”",
      "3": "Others were saying, “We have mortgaged our fields, vineyards, and houses so that we might acquire grain because of hunger.”",
      "4": "Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute against the value of our fields and vineyards.",
      "5": "Now our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen. Our children are like their children, but we are subjugating our sons and our daughters as servants. Indeed, some of our daughters are in bondage already, and we are powerless to do anything because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.",
      "7": "So I contemplated about this for myself and, as a result, I rebuked the nobles and officials and said to them, “Based on the claim of each against his brother, you are exacting usury.” Then I convened a great assembly against them,",
      "8": "and I said to them, “By whatever means we had, we purchased our Jewish countrymen who were being sold to the nations. So, will you once more sell your countrymen so that they might again be sold to us?” Then they kept silent, because they found nothing to answer.",
      "9": "Also I said, “What you are doing is not good! Should not you walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?",
      "10": "Moreover, I, my relatives, and my servants are loaning them money and grain. So, I urge you, cease from this practice of usury.",
      "11": "Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, along with a hundredth part of the money, the grain, the wine, and the oil that you had exacted from them.”",
      "12": "Then they said, “We will restore it and will require nothing of them. We will do what you have said.”\nThen I called the priests and made them swear an oath to keep this promise.",
      "13": "Also I shook out the front of my garment and said, “Like this, may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not carry out this promise. Exactly like this, may he be shaken out and emptied.”\nAnd all the congregation said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.",
      "14": "Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah (from the twentieth year even until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes) twelve years had passed. And my companions and I had not eaten the governor’s food allotment.",
      "15": "The former governors preceding me had extracted a heavy burden on the people, because they took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Moreover, even their servants domineered over the people. But I myself never did so, because of the fear of God.",
      "16": "Furthermore, I stayed determined in the work on this wall. We bought no field, and all my servants were gathered there for the sake of the work.",
      "17": "Moreover there were regularly at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations around us.",
      "18": "Daily there were one ox and six choice sheep prepared for me. Fowls were also prepared for me. Once in ten days all sorts of wine were supplied in abundance. Yet for all this, I never required the governor’s food allotment because it was a heavy burden on this people.",
      "19": "Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."

      "1": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that there was not a gap in it (though at that time I had not erected the doors on the gates),",
      "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, that we might meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.”\nBut they planned to do evil to me.",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so I am not able to come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?”",
      "4": "Four more times they sent for me like this, but I answered them the same way.",
      "5": "Sanballat sent the same request a fifth time by his servant, but the letter was open in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written,\n“It is reported among the nations, and Geshem confirms it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; consequently you are rebuilding the wall. According to these words, you are their king.",
      "7": "You have also appointed prophets to preach on your behalf in Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ According to these words, it will now be reported to the king. So come now and let us consult together.”",
      "8": "I sent him this response, saying, “Nothing like these reports that you are saying has occurred. From your own mind, you are inventing them.”",
      "9": "Because they all wanted to frighten us, they thought, “They will pull their hands back from the work.” But that would never be done.\nSo now, O God, strengthen my hands.",
      "10": "When I came to the house of Shemaiah the crippled son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, he said, “Let us meet together at the house of God, inside the temple, and then we can shut the temple doors. They are coming to kill you! Even tonight, they could come to kill you!”",
      "11": "But I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there like me who would go into the temple to save his life? I would never go!”",
      "12": "Then I perceived and saw that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced the prophecy against me, because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
      "13": "He was hired for this reason: that I might become fearful, act accordingly, and sin. Then they would have an evil report by which they could reproach me.",
      "14": "Remember, O my God, concerning Tobiah and Sanballat these deeds of theirs, as well as the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me.",
      "15": "The wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.",
      "16": "When all our enemies heard it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they were tremendously humbled. They perceived that, because of our God, this work had been accomplished.",
      "17": "Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah produced numerous letters in transit to Tobiah. Likewise, the letters of Tobiah came to them,",
      "18": "because so many in Judah were bound by oath to him since he was the son-in-law of Shekaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berekiah.",

      "42": "and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly. Jezrahiah was their director.",
      "43": "On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great cause for rejoicing. The wives and the children rejoiced, too. From far away the joyful celebration of Jerusalem was heard.",
      "44": "At that time men were appointed to govern over the chambers for the treasures, for the contributions, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, so that they might gather into them out of the fields of the cities the legal portions belonging to the priests and Levites. This was because the celebration of Judah survived on the basis of the priests and the Levites",
      "45": "who, accompanied by the singers and the gatekeepers, attentively preserved the practices of their God and the practices of purification, according to the commandment of David and of his son Solomon.",

      "47": "All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the singers and the gatekeepers their portions, as specified daily. Likewise, they consecrated what was due to the Levites, who then consecrated what was due to the descendants of Aaron."

      "6": "But during this time I was not in Jerusalem, since in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon I had gone to the king. At the conclusion of those days I requested a leave of the king.",
      "7": "When I came to Jerusalem and understood the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah by preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God,",
      "8": "I was very grieved. So, from the chamber I threw all of the household belongings of Tobiah outside.",
      "9": "Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers so that I could return there the vessels of the house of God, the contributions for the offerings, and the frankincense.",
      "10": "When I perceived that the supplies for the Levites had not been given and that the Levites and the singers doing the work had fled, everyone to his own field,",
      "11": "I confronted the officials and asked, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” So I gathered them and stationed them at their posts.",
      "12": "Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil to the storehouses.",
      "13": "Overseeing the replenishing of the storehouse, I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites, and to assist them Hanan the son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, for they were considered reliable, and their task was to distribute to their relatives.",

      "15": "In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the Sabbath or hauling loads of grain or loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all manner of burdens in order to bring them to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So, during the day while they were selling the food goods, I warned them.",
      "16": "Men of Tyre also stayed there, having hauled in fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.",

      "18": "Did not your fathers do likewise? Did not our God bring all this evil against us and against this city? Will you yet bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath?”",
      "19": "As the gates of Jerusalem began to cast the evening shadow before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. Some of my servants I stationed at the gates so that there would be no loads brought in on the Sabbath day.",
      "20": "Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kind of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem.",
      "21": "So I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night next to the wall? If you do so again, I will send you away by force.” From that time on they stopped coming on the Sabbath.",
      "22": "Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves so that they could come and, as guardians of the gates, sanctify the Sabbath day.\nRemember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to Your abundant mercy.",

      "26": "Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, who made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women caused even him to sin.",
