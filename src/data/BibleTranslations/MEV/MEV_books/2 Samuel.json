      "3": "David asked him, “Where have you come from?”\nHe responded, “I fled from the camp of Israel.”",
      "4": "David said to him, “Tell me, what is the report?”\nSo he reported, “The people fled from battle. Many of the people have fallen and died; even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”",
      "5": "Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "The young man who was reporting to him answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa when, in front of me, Saul was leaning on his spear with the chariots and horsemen drawing close.",
      "7": "When he turned around, he noticed me. He summoned me, and I responded, ‘Here I am.’",
      "8": "“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’\n“I answered, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "“Then he said to me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for I have been mortally wounded, yet I am still alive.’",
      "10": "“So I stood beside him and killed him because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”",
      "11": "Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, as did all of the men who were with him.",
      "12": "They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul, Jonathan his son, the people of the Lord, and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.",
      "13": "Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “Where are you from?”\nHe responded, “I am the son of one who sought refuge, an Amalekite.”",
      "14": "David said to him, “How is it that you did not fear raising your hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?”",
      "15": "Then David called to one of the young men and said, “Step forward and execute him.” So he struck him and killed him.",
      "16": "But David said to him, “Your blood is upon your own head, since your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I put an end to the anointed of the Lord.’ ”",

      "2": "So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.",
      "3": "And David brought the men who were with him, each man with his household, and they lived in the cities of Hebron.",
      "4": "Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David as king over the house of Judah, and they informed David that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul.",
      "5": "So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead saying, “May you be blessed by the Lord, you who have shown this loyalty to your lord Saul by burying him.",
      "6": "Now may the Lord show you loyalty and faithfulness, even as I deal kindly with you who have done this thing.",

      "13": "And Joab the son of Zeruiah, with the servants of David, went out in order to meet together at the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the side of the pool opposite them.",
      "14": "Abner suggested to Joab, “Let the young men come forward and compete before us.”\nAnd Joab replied, “Let them come.”",
      "15": "So they stepped forward and were counted, twelve from Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth and twelve from the servants of David.",
      "16": "Each one grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is at Gibeon.",
      "17": "The fighting was very fierce that day, but Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David.",
      "18": "Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as fast as a wild gazelle.",

      "20": "Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”\nHe answered, “It is I.”",
      "21": "Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or left, overtake one of the young men, and take his equipment for yourself,” but Asahel was not willing to desist.",
      "22": "Abner continued still to reason with Asahel, “Abandon your pursuit. Why should I strike you down? How then could I show my face to your brother Joab?”",
      "23": "But he refused to desist. So Abner struck him in the abdomen with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out of his back. He fell there and died on the spot. When all of the others came to the place where Asahel fell and died, they halted.",
      "24": "But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. As the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is next to Giah on the way to the Wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "The sons of Benjamin gathered to the rear of Abner into a single formation, and they took their stand atop one of the hills.",
      "26": "Abner called to Joab, “Must the sword consume forever? Do you not understand that a bitter taste will result in the end? How long will you refuse to command the people to withdraw from chasing their brothers?”",
      "27": "Joab responded, “As God lives, I assure you that if you had not said this, the people would have each pursued his brother throughout the night.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still. They pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore.",
      "29": "So Abner and his men traveled through the Arabah all that night, crossed the Jordan, and marched all morning until they returned to Mahanaim.",
      "30": "Joab refrained from pursuing Abner, but instead mustered all of the people. There were nineteen men besides Asahel missing from among the servants of David.",
      "31": "But the servants of David routed Benjamin and the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty of their men died.",
      "32": "They carried Asahel back and interred him in his father’s tomb, which was at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled throughout the night and reached Hebron at dawn."

      "7": "Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, and Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”",
      "8": "Abner became very angry over the words of Ish-Bosheth. He said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Each day I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends by not allowing you to fall into the hand of David. Yet today you are charging me with guilt concerning this woman.",

      "13": "He responded, “Very well, I will make a covenant with you, but I require one thing from you: you will not see my face unless you bring Michal the daughter of Saul with you when you come to see me.”",
      "14": "Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for one hundred Philistine foreskins.”",
      "15": "So Ish-Bosheth sent for her, and he took her from her husband, Paltiel the son of Laish.",

      "19": "Abner also spoke privately with Benjamin. Then Abner went to tell David privately at Hebron all that was received favorably by Israel and the entire house of Benjamin.",
      "20": "So Abner, along with twenty men, went to David at Hebron, and David held a festival for Abner and the men who were with him.",
      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me arise, go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went peaceably.",
      "22": "Now the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much plunder with them, but Abner was no longer with David at Hebron, because he had sent him away in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and the whole of the army that was with him arrived, they reported to Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king and he sent him away peaceably.”",
      "24": "So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you. Why is it that you sent him away? Now he is long gone.",
      "25": "You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to learn of your coming and going, to discern all that you are doing.”",
      "26": "When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. However, David was not aware of this.",
      "27": "So Abner returned to Hebron, and Joab pulled him aside in the gateway so as to speak with him undisturbed. There he struck him in the midsection so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel, his brother.",
      "28": "Afterward when David heard of this, he said, “My kingdom and I are forever blameless before the Lord for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.",
      "29": "May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father’s house. May the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks food.”",
