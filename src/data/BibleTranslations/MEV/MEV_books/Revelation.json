      "21": "I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, but she did not repent.",
      "22": "Look! I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.",
      "23": "I will put her children to death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the hearts and minds. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.",
