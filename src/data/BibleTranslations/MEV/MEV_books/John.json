      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He was in the beginning with God.",
      "3": "All things were created through Him, and without Him nothing was created that was created.",
      "4": "In Him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.",
      "5": "The light shines in darkness, but the darkness has not overcome it.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God whose name was John.",
      "7": "This man came as a witness in order to testify concerning the Light, that all men through Him might believe.",
      "8": "He was not this Light, but was sent in order to testify concerning the Light.",
      "9": "The true Light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was created through Him, yet the world did not know Him.",
      "11": "He came to His own, and His own people did not receive Him.",
      "12": "Yet to all who received Him, He gave the power to become sons of God, to those who believed in His name,",
      "13": "who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John bore witness of Him and cried out, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ ”",
      "16": "We have all received from His fullness grace upon grace.",
      "17": "For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has seen God at any time. The only Son, who is at the Father’s side, has made Him known.",
      "19": "Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”",
      "21": "They asked him, “Who then? Are you Elijah?”\nHe said, “I am not.”\n“Are you the Prophet?”\nHe answered, “No.”",
      "22": "They said to him then, “Who are you? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say concerning yourself?”",
      "23": "John said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ just as the prophet Isaiah said.”",
      "24": "Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "They asked him, “Why do you baptize then, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, “I baptize with water, but One stands among you, whom you do not know.",
      "27": "This is He who comes after me, who is preferred before me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”",
      "28": "These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.",
      "30": "This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.’",
      "31": "I did not know Him, but for this reason I came baptizing with water: so that He might be revealed to Israel.”",
      "32": "Then John bore witness, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him.",
      "33": "I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The One on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I have seen and have borne witness that He is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "Again, the next day John was standing with two of his disciples.",
      "36": "Looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "Then Jesus turned, saw them following, and said to them, “What do you seek?”\nAnd they said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?”",
      "39": "Jesus said to them, “Come and see.”\nSo they came and saw where He stayed and remained with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.",
      "41": "He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means the Christ).",
      "42": "Then he brought him to Jesus.\nWhen Jesus saw him, He said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).",
      "43": "The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip, and said to him, “Follow Me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, as well as the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”",
      "46": "Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”\nPhilip said to him, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, “Here is an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.”",
      "48": "Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?”\nJesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”",
      "51": "And He said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there.",
      "2": "Both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”",
      "4": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”",
      "6": "Six water pots made of stone were sitting there, used for ceremonial cleansing by the Jews, containing twenty to thirty gallons each.",
      "7": "Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "Then He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.”\nAnd they took it.",
      "9": "When the master of the feast tasted the water that had been turned into wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,",
      "10": "and he said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and after men have drunk freely, then the poor wine is served. But you have kept the good wine until now.”",
      "11": "This, the first of His signs, Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.",
      "12": "After this He, and His mother, and His brothers, and His disciples went down to Capernaum. They remained there a few days.",
      "13": "The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "In the temple He found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.",
      "15": "When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. He poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables.",
      "16": "He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”",
      "18": "Then the Jews said to Him, “What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”",
      "20": "Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But He was speaking concerning the temple of His body.",
      "22": "Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them. And they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.",
      "23": "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.",
      "24": "But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all men,",
      "25": "and did not need anyone to bear witness of man, for He knew what was in man."

    "3": {
      "1": "There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
      "2": "He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can this be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, but you do not know these things?",
      "11": "Truly, truly I say to you, We speak of what We know and bear witness of what We have seen, but you do not receive Our testimony.",
      "12": "If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended to heaven except He who descended from heaven, even the Son of Man who is in heaven.",
      "14": "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but may have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.",
      "18": "He who believes in Him is not condemned. But he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
      "19": "This is the verdict, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.",
      "21": "But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be revealed that his deeds have been done in God.”",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. He remained with them there and baptized.",
      "23": "John also was baptizing in Aenon toward Salim, because much water was there. And people came and were baptized.",
      "24": "For John had not yet been put in prison.",
      "25": "Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about ceremonial cleansing.",
      "26": "They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, look, He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.”",
      "27": "John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves bear witness of me, that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before Him.’",
      "29": "He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.”",
      "31": "He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "He bears witness of what He has seen and heard, yet no one receives His testimony.",
      "33": "He who has received His testimony has certified that God is true.",
      "34": "For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure to Him.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son, and has placed all things into His hand.",
      "36": "He who believes in the Son has eternal life. He who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."

      "2": "(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),",
      "3": "He left Judea and departed again to Galilee.",
      "4": "Now it was necessary that He go through Samaria.",
      "5": "So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, being exhausted from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came there to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”",
      "8": "For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.",
      "9": "Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.",
      "10": "Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?",
      "12": "Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, along with his sons and his livestock?”",
      "13": "Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,",
      "14": "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water that I shall give him will become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not thirst, nor come here to draw.”",
      "16": "Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”",
      "17": "The woman answered, “I have no husband.”\nJesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband,’",
      "18": "for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. So you have spoken truthfully.”",
      "19": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you all say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.",
      "22": "You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.",
      "23": "Yet the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. For the Father seeks such to worship Him.",
      "24": "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When He comes, He will tell us all things.”",

      "27": "Then His disciples came. They marveled that He talked with a woman. Yet no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why are You talking with her?”",
      "28": "The woman then left her water pot, went her way into the city, and said to the men,",
      "29": "“Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”",
      "30": "They went out of the city and came to Him.",
      "31": "Meanwhile His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”",
      "32": "But He said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.”",
      "33": "Therefore the disciples said one to another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?”",
      "34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest’? Listen! I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.",
      "36": "He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit that leads to eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.",
      "37": "For in this is the saying true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap a crop for which you did not labor. And you have benefited from their labor.”",
      "39": "Many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all that I ever did.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them. And He stayed there two days.",
      "41": "And many more believed because of His word.",

      "43": "After the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
      "45": "Then, when He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all the things He did at Jerusalem at the feast. For they had also gone to the feast.",
      "46": "So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him, pleading that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”",
      "49": "The nobleman said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your son lives.”\nAnd the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.",
      "51": "While he was going down, his servants met him and told him, “Your son lives!”",
      "52": "When he inquired of them the hour when he began to heal, they answered, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”",
      "53": "Then the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” So he and his whole household believed.",

      "3": "In these lay a great crowd of invalids, blind, lame, and paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water.",
      "4": "For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water. After the stirring of the water, whoever stepped in first was healed of whatever disease he had.",
      "5": "A certain man was there who had an illness for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been in that condition now a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to be healed?”",
      "7": "The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.”",

      "11": "He answered them, “He who healed me said to me, ‘Take up your bed and walk.’ ”",
      "12": "So they asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”",
      "13": "Now the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place.",

      "15": "The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.",

      "17": "Jesus answered them, “My Father is working still, and I am working.”",
      "18": "So the Jews sought even more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do. For whatever He does, likewise the Son does.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these so that you may marvel.",
