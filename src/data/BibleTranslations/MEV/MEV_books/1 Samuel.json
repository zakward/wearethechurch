      "1": "Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim Zuphim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "And he had two wives; the name of one was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "This man went up out of his city annually to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh. And there the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the Lord.",
      "4": "When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.",
      "5": "But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed her womb.",
      "6": "Now her rival provoked her greatly, making her miserable because the Lord had closed her womb.",
      "7": "Thus it was yearly, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she provoked her. So Hannah wept and did not eat.",
      "8": "Then said Elkanah her husband to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? And why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "So Hannah arose after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a seat by the door of the tabernacle of the Lord.",
      "10": "And she was bitter, and prayed to the Lord, and wept severely.",
      "11": "So she made a vow and said, “O Lord of Hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant, and remember me and not forget Your maidservant, but will give to Your maidservant a baby boy, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”",
      "12": "And as she was praying before the Lord, Eli watched her mouth.",
      "13": "Now Hannah was speaking in her heart. Her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.",
      "14": "So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine from you.”",
      "15": "And Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrow. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.",
      "16": "Do not consider your handmaid to be a sinful woman, for out of the abundance of my concern and provocation I have spoken until now.”",
      "17": "Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant you your request that you have asked of Him.”",
      "18": "And she said, “Let your handmaid find grace in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was not sad as before.",
      "19": "They rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the Lord. And they returned and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.",
      "20": "And it came to pass that Hannah conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel saying, “Because I have asked him of the Lord.”",
      "21": "Then the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow.",
      "22": "But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, “I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord and live there forever.”",
      "23": "So Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word.” So the woman remained, and nursed her son until she weaned him.",
      "24": "When she had weaned him, she took him up with her with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine. And she brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, though the boy was young.",
      "25": "Then they slaughtered a bull, and they brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here praying to the Lord.",
      "27": "For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him.",
      "28": "Therefore also I have let the Lord have him. As long as he lives he will be dedicated to the Lord.” And he worshipped the Lord there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Hannah prayed, saying:\n“My heart rejoices in the Lord;\n    my horn is exalted in the Lord.\nMy mouth is bold against my enemies,\n    because I rejoice in Your salvation.",
      "2": "“There is none holy as the Lord,\n    for there is none besides You,\n    and there is no rock like our God.",
      "3": "“Do not multiply proud speech,\n    nor let arrogance come out of your mouth,\nfor the Lord is the God of knowledge,\n    and by Him actions are examined.",
      "4": "“The bows of the mighty are broken,\n    but those who stumbled are girded with strength.",
      "5": "Those that were full have hired out themselves for bread,\n    and those that were hungry ceased to hunger.\nEven the barren has borne seven,\n    and she that has many children wastes away.",
      "6": "“The Lord kills and makes alive;\n    He brings down to the grave and brings up.",
      "7": "The Lord makes poor and makes rich;\n    He brings low and lifts up.",
      "8": "He raises up the poor out of the dust\n    and lifts up the oppressed from the dunghill\nto make them sit with princes\n    and inherit a throne of glory. \n“For the pillars of the earth belong to the Lord,\n    and He has set the world upon them.",
      "9": "He will guard the feet of His saints,\n    but the wicked will be silent in darkness. \n“For by strength shall no man prevail.",
      "10": "The adversaries of the Lord will be broken to pieces;\nHe will thunder against them out of heaven.\n    The Lord will judge the ends of the earth. \n“He will give strength to His king\n    and exalt the horn of His anointed.”",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest.",
      "12": "Now the sons of Eli were corrupt. They did not know the Lord.",
      "13": "The priest’s custom with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the flesh was cooking with a three-pronged fork in his hand.",
      "14": "And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot, and all that the fork brought up the priest took for himself. This they did in Shiloh to all the children of Israel who came there.",
      "15": "Even before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast. For he will not take boiled meat from you, but only raw.”",
      "16": "If any man said to him, “Let them first burn the fat and then take as much as you wish,” then he would answer him, “No, but you will give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.”",
      "17": "Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord. For the men treated the offering of the Lord with contempt.",
      "18": "But Samuel ministered before the Lord, as a boy, wearing a linen ephod.",
      "19": "Now his mother would make him a little coat and brought it to him every year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.",
      "20": "And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “The Lord give you offspring from this woman for the sake of the request which was made to the Lord.” Then they would return to their home.",
      "21": "The Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the Lord.",
      "22": "Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, even that they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "He said to them, “Why are you doing these things? For I am hearing of your evil dealings from all these people.",
      "24": "No, my sons! Truly, it is not a good report that I hear the people of the Lord spreading.",
      "25": "If one man sins against another, God will judge him, but if a man sins against the Lord, who will intercede for him?” But they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the Lord desired to kill them.",
      "26": "Now the boy Samuel was growing both in stature and favor with the Lord and also with men.",
      "27": "A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Did I not plainly reveal Myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?",
      "28": "And choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire by the children of Israel?",
      "29": "Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering, which I have commanded in My dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?’",
      "30": "“Therefore the Lord God of Israel says, ‘I surely said that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before Me forever,’ but now the Lord says, ‘Far be it from Me to do so, for those who honor Me, I will honor, and those that despise Me will be humbled.",
      "31": "The days are coming when I will cut off your authority and the strength of your father’s house, so there shall not be an old man in your house.",
      "32": "You shall see the distress of My dwelling, despite all the good which will be done for Israel. And there shall not be an elderly man in your house perpetually.",
      "33": "Yet the one I do not cut off from My altar will be spared so your eyes will not stop weeping or your soul grieving. All the increase of your house will die in their prime.",
      "34": "“ ‘This will be the sign to you which will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: In one day, they will both die.",
      "35": "And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest; what is in My heart and in My soul he will do it. And I will build him a sure house, and it will walk before My anointed forever.",
      "36": "But it will be that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and will say, Please attach me to one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.’ ”"

    "3": {
      "1": "Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was rare in those days. There was no vision coming forth.",
      "2": "At that time, Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow weak that he could not see),",
      "3": "and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord where the ark of God was.",
      "4": "Then the Lord called to Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.”",
      "5": "He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called to me.”\nAnd he said, “I did not call. Return, lie down again.” And he went and lay down.",
      "6": "The Lord called Samuel again. So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”\nAnd he answered, “I did not call, my son. Return, lie down again.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.",
      "8": "The Lord again called Samuel a third time. So he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”\nThen Eli understood that the Lord was calling to the boy.",
      "9": "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. And it will be, if He calls you, that you will say, ‘Speak, Lord, for Your servant listens.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "The Lord came and stood, and He called as at other times, “Samuel, Samuel.”\nThen Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant listens.”",
      "11": "The Lord said to Samuel, “See, I am doing something in Israel which will make both ears ring of every one that hears it.",
      "12": "In that day I will bring about against Eli everything which I have spoken with regard to his house, from beginning to end.",
      "13": "For I told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, because his sons are cursed, and he did not rebuke them.",
      "14": "Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice nor offering forever.”",
      "15": "Samuel lay until the morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord. Now Samuel feared to report the vision to Eli.",
      "16": "Then Eli called Samuel, and said, “Samuel, my son.”\nAnd he answered, “Here I am.”",
      "17": "He said, “What is the thing that the Lord has spoken to you? Do not hide it from me. Thus may God do so to you, and more also, if you hide from me a word out of all the things that He spoke to you.”",
      "18": "Samuel told him everything, and did not hide from him a thing. And he said, “It is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His eyes.”",
      "19": "And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was proven to be a prophet of the Lord.",
      "21": "And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh. For the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.\nAnd Israel went out to battle against the Philistines and they made camp beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines arrayed themselves in a battle line against Israel, and when the battle was over, Israel was beaten before the Philistines, who struck down on the field of battle about four thousand men.",
      "3": "When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the Lord struck us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh to us, that it might come among us and rescue us out of the hand of our enemies.”",
      "4": "So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of Hosts, who dwells above the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
      "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the ground was in an uproar.",
      "6": "When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, “What does this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp.",
      "7": "The Philistines were afraid, when they said, “God is come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For this has never happened to us before.",
      "8": "Woe to us! Who will deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.",
      "9": "Be strong and be men, O Philistines, lest you be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Now be men and fight.”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought and Israel was beaten. And they fled every man into his tent. It was a very great defeat, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.",
      "11": "Now the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "There ran a man of Benjamin from the battle line, and he came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and with dust upon his head.",
      "13": "When he came, Eli was sitting on a seat by the wayside watching. For his heart feared for the ark of God. Now the man came to tell it in the city, and all the city cried out.",
      "14": "When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”\nAnd the man hurriedly came and told Eli.",
      "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see.",
      "16": "The man said to Eli, “I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the battle line.”\nAnd he said, “What is the word, my son?”",
      "17": "The messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there also has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead. And the ark of God is taken.”",
      "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate. And his neck broke and he died, for he was an old and heavy man. And he had judged Israel forty years.",

      "20": "About the time of her death the women that stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or regard it.",
      "21": "She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory is departed from Israel,” because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",

      "3": "When the Ashdodites arose early in the morning, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon and set him in his place again.",
      "4": "When they arose early on the next morning, again Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold. Only the torso of Dagon was left to him.",
      "5": "Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any coming into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.",
      "6": "But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Ashdodites. He desolated them and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its territories.",
      "7": "When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel cannot remain with us. For His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.”",
      "8": "So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”\nAnd they answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried around to Gath.” And they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.",
      "9": "It happened that after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction. And He struck the men of the city, both small and great. And tumors broke out on them.",
      "10": "Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\nAnd it came about that as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to slay us and our people.”",
      "11": "So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to His own place that He might not kill me and my people,” for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there.",

      "3": "They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty. But return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”",
      "4": "Then said they, “What will be the guilt offering which we will return to Him?”\nThey answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the Philistines. For one plague was on you all, and on your lords.",
      "5": "Therefore you will make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land. And you will give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from off you, even from off your gods and from off your land.",
      "6": "Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He dealt severely with them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?",
      "7": "“Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows on which there has never been a yoke. Then tie the cows to the cart and bring their calves home, away from them.",

      "10": "The men did so. And they took two milk cows, tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.",
      "11": "And they set the ark of the Lord on the cart, as well as the box with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.",
      "12": "Then the cows took the straight way to the way of Beth Shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went. They did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left with the lords of the Philistines walking after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.",
      "13": "Now Beth Shemesh was reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and they rejoiced to see it.",
      "14": "The cart came into the field of Joshua, the Beth Shemite, and stood there where there was a great stone. And they split the wood of the cart, and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.",
