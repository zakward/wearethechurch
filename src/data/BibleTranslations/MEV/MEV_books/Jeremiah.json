      "21": "Yet I had planted you a noble vine,\n    a wholly faithful seed.\nHow then have you turned\n    into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to Me?",

      "23": "How can you say, “I am not polluted,\n    I have not gone after the Baals”?\nSee your way in the valley.\n    Know what you have done.\nYou are a swift young camel\n    entangling her ways,",
      "24": "a wild donkey used to the wilderness\n    that sniffs the wind in her passion.\n    In the time of her heat, who can turn her away?\nAll those who seek her will not weary themselves;\n    in her month they shall find her.",
      "25": "Withhold your foot from being unshod\n    and your throat from thirst.\nBut you said, “There is no hope. No!\n    For I have loved strangers,\n    and after them I will go.”",
      "26": "As the thief is ashamed when he is found,\n    so is the house of Israel ashamed.\nThey, their kings, their officials,\n    and their priests, and their prophets",
      "27": "say to a tree, “You are my father.”\n    And to a stone, “You gave birth to me.”\nFor they have turned their back to Me,\n    and not their face.\nBut in the time of their trouble they will say,\n    “Arise and save us.”",
      "28": "But where are your gods that you have made for yourself?\n    Let them arise, if they can save you\n    in the time of your trouble;\nfor according to the number of your cities\n    are your gods, O Judah.",
      "29": "Why will you plead with Me?\n    You all have transgressed against Me,\n    says the Lord.",
      "30": "In vain I have smitten your children;\n    they received no correction.\nYour own sword has devoured your prophets\n    like a destroying lion.",
      "31": "O generation, consider the word of the Lord:\nHave I been a wilderness to Israel?\n    A land of darkness?\nWhy do My people say, “We are free to roam.\n    We will come no more to You”?",
      "32": "Can a virgin forget her ornaments,\n    or a bride her attire?\nYet My people have forgotten Me\n    for days without number.",
      "33": "You prepare your way very well to seek love.\n    Therefore you have also taught the wicked women your ways.",
      "34": "Also in your skirts is found\n    the blood of the souls of the innocent poor.\n    I have not found it by breaking in,\nbut in spite of all these things.",
      "35": "Yet you say, “Because I am innocent,\n    surely His anger shall turn away from me.”\nNow I will plead with you,\n    because you say, “I have not sinned.”",
      "36": "Why do you go about so much\n    to change your way?\nYou also shall be ashamed of Egypt,\n    as you were ashamed of Assyria.",
      "37": "Indeed, you shall go forth from him\n    with your hands upon your head;\nfor the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust,\n    and you shall not prosper in them."
