      "1": "The word of the Lord, which came to Micah the Morashite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, all you peoples!\n    Listen, earth and everything in it,\nthat the Sovereign Lord may be a witness against you,\n    the Lord from His holy temple.",
      "3": "Look! The Lord is coming out from His place,\n    so that He might come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains will melt beneath Him,\n    and the valleys split apart\nlike wax before the fire,\n    like waters deluged down a slope.",
      "5": "All this because of the transgression of Jacob\n    and because of the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\nAnd what is the high place of Judah?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field\n    for the planting of vineyards.\nI will dump her stones into the valley\n    and expose her foundations.",
      "7": "All her idols will be shattered,\n    and her gifts burned with fire,\n    and I will annihilate her images,\nbecause she gathered them as the wages of a prostitute,\n    and as the wages of a prostitute they will again be used.",
      "8": "Because of this I will lament and wail,\n    I will go about barefoot and naked;\nI will howl like the jackals\n    and moan like owlets.",
      "9": "For her wound is mortal,\n    for it has come to Judah;\nit has extended to the gate of my people,\n    to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Do not tell it in Gath,\n    do not weep at all;\nin Beth Ophrah,\n    roll around in the dust.",
      "11": "Pass on your way,\n    inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed;\nthe inhabitants of Zaanan\n    have not come out.\nThe mourning of Beth Ezel\n    has taken from you its foothold.",
      "12": "Indeed the inhabitants of Maroth\n    wait anxiously for good,\nbecause calamity has come down from the Lord\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the chariot to the steeds,\n    inhabitants of Lachish.\nIt was the beginning of sin\n    to the daughter of Zion,\nbecause in you were found\n    the transgressions of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth Gath;\nthe houses of Akzib will be deception\n    to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring a conqueror to you,\n    inhabitants of Mareshah;\nthe glory of Israel\n    will come to Adullam.",

      "3": "Therefore, thus says the Lord:\nI am devising disaster against this family,\n    from which you cannot remove your necks;\nand you will not walk haughtily,\n    for it will be a time of calamity.",
      "4": "In that day they will take up a taunt against you,\n    and they will wail a wailing lament, and say:\n“We are totally ruined!\n    He diminishes the portion of my people;\nhow He removes it from me!\n    To a traitor He reassigns our fields!”",
      "5": "Therefore you will not have anyone to apportion the land by lot\n    in the assembly of the Lord.",
      "6": "“Do not prophesy,” they say.\n    “One should not prophesy about these things.\n    Disgrace will not overtake us.”",
      "7": "Should it be said, O house of Jacob,\n    “Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?\n    Are these His deeds?” \nDo not My words benefit\n    him who walks uprightly?",
      "8": "But lately My people rise up\n    like an enemy.\nYou strip off the rich robe\n    from those who pass by trustingly,\n    like men returning from war.",
      "9": "The women of My people you drive out\n    from their delightful homes;\nfrom their children\n    you take My adornment forever.",

      "13": "He who breaks through has gone up before them;\n    they will break through and pass the gate and go out by it.\nThen their king will pass on before them,\n    the Lord at their head."

      "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord,\n    but He will not answer them;\nHe will hide His face from them at that time,\n    because they have wrought evil deeds.",
      "5": "Thus says the Lord:\nRegarding the prophets\n    who mislead My people—\nthe ones who have something to eat\n    proclaim “Peace,”\nbut if one does not feed them,\n    then they prepare for war against him.",
      "6": "Therefore you will have night without vision,\n    and you will have darkness without divination;\nthe sun will set upon the prophets,\n    and black upon them will be the day.",
      "7": "The seers will be shamed\n    and the diviners disgraced,\nand they will all cover their beards,\n    for there is no answer from God.",
      "8": "But as for me, I am filled with power,\n    with the Spirit of the Lord,\n    and with justice and might,\nto declare to Jacob his transgression\n    and to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Please hear this, heads of the house of Jacob\n    and rulers of the house of Israel,\nwho detest justice\n    and warp all that is straight,",
      "10": "who build Zion with bloodguilt\n    and Jerusalem with wickedness.",
      "11": "Her leaders judge for a bribe,\n    her priests teach for a price,\n    and her prophets practice divination for money.\nYet upon the Lord they lean, saying,\n    “Is not the Lord in our midst?\n    Evil will not come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore, because of you,\n    Zion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem will be mounds of ruins,\n    and the mountain of the house will become wooded heights."

    "4": {
      "1": "Then it will be that in the latter days,\nthe mountain of the house of the Lord will be established\n    as head of the mountains,\nand will be lifted up above the hills;\n    and people will stream to it.",
      "2": "And many nations will come and say,\n“Come, that we might go up to the mountain of the Lord,\n    and to the house of the God of Jacob,\nthat He might teach us His ways,\n    and that we might walk in His paths.”\nFor from Zion will go forth the law,\n    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.",
