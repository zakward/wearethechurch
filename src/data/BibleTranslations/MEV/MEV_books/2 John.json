      "1": "The elder,\nTo the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,",
      "2": "for the sake of the truth, which remains in us, and will be with us forever:",
      "3": "Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.",
      "4": "I greatly rejoiced that I found some of your children walking in truth as we were commanded by the Father.",
      "5": "And now I ask you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.",
      "6": "And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.",
      "7": "For many deceivers, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Each one is a deceiver and an antichrist.",
      "8": "Watch yourselves, so that we do not lose those things for which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward.",
      "9": "Whoever transgresses and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.",
      "10": "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, nor greet him.",
      "11": "For whoever greets him takes part in his evil deeds.",
      "12": "I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to write with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face that our joy may be complete.",
      "13": "The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen."
