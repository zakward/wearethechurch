      "2": "Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, even as your soul is well.",
      "3": "For I greatly rejoiced when brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth.",
      "4": "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.",
      "5": "Beloved, you are faithful in all you do for the brothers and for strangers,",
      "6": "who have testified of your love before the church. You will do well to send them along on their journey in a manner worthy of God.",
      "7": "For His nameâ€™s sake they went out, receiving no help from the Gentiles.",
      "8": "Therefore we ought to receive such men, that we might be fellow workers for the truth.",
      "9": "I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to put himself first among them, did not accept us.",
      "10": "Because of this, if I come, I will bring up what kinds of works he does: ranting against us with malicious words. Not content with that, he does not accept the brothers, and stops those who want to, and throws them out of the church.",
      "11": "Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. Whoever does good is from God, but whoever does evil has not seen God.",
      "12": "Demetrius receives good reports from everyone and from the truth itself. Yes, and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.",
      "13": "I had many things to write, but I would rather not write to you with pen and ink.",
      "14": "Instead, I hope to see you soon, and we shall speak face to face.\nPeace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
