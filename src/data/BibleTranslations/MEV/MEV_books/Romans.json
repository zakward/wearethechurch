      "2": "which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,",
      "3": "concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh",
      "4": "and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.",
      "5": "Through Him we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all nations for His name,",
      "6": "among whom you also are called by Jesus Christ:",
      "7": "To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:\nGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.",
      "9": "For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing, I mention you always in my prayers,",
      "10": "making request if, by any means, now at last I might find a way in the will of God to come to you.",
      "11": "For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be strengthened.",
      "12": "This is so that I may be encouraged together with you by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.",
      "13": "Now I would not have you unaware, brothers, that I often intended to come to you (but was prevented until now), that I might have a harvest among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.",
      "14": "I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.",
      "15": "So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",
      "17": "For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith. As it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”",
      "18": "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth through unrighteousness.",
      "19": "For what may be known about God is clear to them since God has shown it to them.",
      "20": "The invisible things about Him—His eternal power and deity—have been clearly seen since the creation of the world and are understood by the things that are made, so that they are without excuse.",
      "21": "Because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him or give thanks to Him as God, but became futile in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened.",
      "22": "Claiming to be wise, they became fools.",
      "23": "They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, birds, four-footed beasts, and creeping things.",
      "24": "Therefore God gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.",
      "25": "They turned the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.",
      "26": "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged the natural function for what is against nature.",
      "27": "Likewise the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men with men doing that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.",
      "28": "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not proper.",
      "29": "They were filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit. They are gossips,",
      "30": "slanderers, God-haters, insolent, proud, boastful, inventors of evil things, and disobedient toward parents,",
      "31": "without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, calloused, and unmerciful,",
      "32": "who know the righteous requirement of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death. They not only do them, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them."

    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judges, for when you judge another, you condemn yourself, for you who judge do the same things.",
      "2": "But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who commit such things.",
      "3": "Do you think, O man, who judges those who do such things, and who does the same thing, that you will escape the judgment of God?",
      "4": "Do you despise the riches of His goodness, tolerance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?",
      "5": "But because of your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up treasures of wrath against yourself on the day of wrath when the righteous judgment of God will be revealed,",
      "6": "and He “will render to every man according to his deeds.”",
      "7": "To those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality will be eternal life.",
      "8": "But to those who are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath,",
      "9": "will be tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and then to the Gentile.",
      "10": "But glory, honor, and peace will be to every man who does good work—to the Jew first, and then to the Gentile,",
      "11": "for there is no partiality with God.",
      "12": "As many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law,",
      "13": "for the hearers of the law are not justified before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.",
      "14": "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves,",
      "15": "who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, while their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them,",
      "16": "in the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ.",
      "17": "Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast in God.",
      "18": "You know His will and approve the things that are more excellent, because you are instructed in the law.",
      "19": "You are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,",
      "20": "an instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of babes, who have the full content of knowledge and truth in the law:",
      "21": "You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?",
      "22": "You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
      "23": "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law?",
      "24": "As it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”",
      "25": "Circumcision indeed has merit, if you keep the law, but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.",
      "26": "Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteousness of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?",
      "27": "Will the uncircumcised one who is righteous by nature, if he fulfills the law, not judge you who, by the letter of the law and circumcision, violate the law?",
      "28": "He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is external in the flesh.",
      "29": "But he is a Jew who is one inwardly. And circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, and not by the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "What advantage then does the Jew have? Or what profit is there in circumcision?",
      "2": "Much in every way! Chiefly because the oracles of God were entrusted to them.",
      "3": "What if some did not believe? Would their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?",
      "4": "God forbid! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written:\n“That You may be justified in Your words,\n    and may prevail in Your judging.”",
      "5": "But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous in taking vengeance? (I am speaking in human terms.)",
      "6": "God forbid! For then how could God judge the world?",
      "7": "If through my lie the truth of God has abounded more to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "Why not rather say, “Let us do evil that good may come,” as we are slanderously accused and as some claim that we say? Their condemnation is just.",
      "9": "What then? Are we better than they? No, not at all. For we have already charged that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.",
      "10": "As it is written:\n“There is none righteous, no, not one;",
      "11": "there is no one who understands;\n    there is no one who seeks after God.",
      "12": "They have all turned aside;\n    together they have become worthless;\nthere is no one who does good,\n    no, not one.”",
      "13": "“Their throats are an open grave;\n    with their tongues they have used deceit”;\n“the poison of vipers is under their lips”;",
      "14": "“their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”",
      "15": "“Their feet are swift to shed blood;",
      "16": "destruction and misery are in their paths;",
      "17": "and they do not know the way of peace.”",
      "18": "“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”",
      "19": "Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and all the world may become accountable to God.",
      "20": "Therefore by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.",
      "21": "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.",
      "22": "This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all and upon all who believe, for there is no distinction.",
      "23": "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,",
      "24": "being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,",
      "25": "whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith, in His blood, for a demonstration of His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins previously committed,",
      "26": "to prove His righteousness at this present time so that He might be just and be the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.",
      "27": "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.",
      "28": "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.",
      "29": "Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,",
      "30": "seeing it is one God, who shall justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.",
      "31": "Do we then make the law void through faith? God forbid! Instead, we establish the law."

      "1": "What then shall we say that Abraham, our father according to the flesh, has found?",
      "2": "If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.",
      "3": "What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "4": "Now to him who works, wages are not given as a gift, but as a debt.",
      "5": "But to him who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.",
      "6": "Even David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness without works:",
      "7": "“Blessed are those\n    whose iniquities are forgiven,\n    and whose sins are covered;",
      "8": "blessed is the man\n    to whom the Lord shall not impute sin.”",
      "9": "Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? We are saying that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.",
      "10": "How then was it credited? When he was in circumcision? Or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.",
      "11": "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while being uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them also,",
      "12": "and the father of circumcision to those who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had while still being uncircumcised.",
      "13": "It was not through the law that Abraham and his descendants received the promise that he would be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.",
      "14": "For if those who are of the law become heirs, faith would be made void and the promise nullified,",
      "15": "because the law produces wrath, for where there is no law, there is no sin.",
      "16": "Therefore the promise comes through faith, so that it might be by grace, that the promise would be certain to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all",
      "17": "(as it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations”) before God whom he believed, and who raises the dead, and calls those things that do not exist as though they did.",
      "18": "Against all hope, he believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations according to what was spoken, “So shall your descendants be.”",
      "19": "And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body to be dead (when he was about a hundred years old), nor yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb.",
      "20": "He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,",
      "21": "and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was able to perform.",
      "22": "Therefore “it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "23": "Now the words, “it was credited to him,” were not written for his sake only,",
      "24": "but also for us, to whom it shall be credited if we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,",
      "25": "who was delivered for our transgressions, and was raised for our justification."

      "3": "Not only so, but we also boast in tribulation, knowing that tribulation produces patience,",
      "4": "patience produces character, and character produces hope.",
      "5": "And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.",
      "6": "While we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.",
      "7": "Rarely for a righteous man will one die. Yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.",
      "8": "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.",
      "9": "How much more then, being now justified by His blood, shall we be saved from wrath through Him.",
      "10": "For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, how much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by His life.",
      "11": "Furthermore, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.",
      "12": "Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, so death has spread to all men, because all have sinned.",
      "13": "For until the law, sin was in the world. But sin is not counted when there is no law.",
      "14": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam’s sin, who was a type of Him who was to come.",
      "15": "But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if through the trespass of one man many died, then how much more has the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.",
      "16": "The gift is not like the result that came through the one who sinned. For the judgment from one sin led to condemnation, but the free gift, which came after many trespasses, leads to justification.",
      "17": "For if by one man’s trespass death reigned through him, then how much more will those who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "Therefore just as through the trespass of one man came condemnation for all men, so through the righteous act of One came justification of life for all men.",
      "19": "For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One the many will be made righteous.",
      "20": "But the law entered, so that sin might increase, but where sin increased, grace abounded much more,",
      "21": "so that just as sin reigned in death, grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

      "1": "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may increase?",
      "2": "God forbid! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?",
      "3": "Do you not know that we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?",
      "4": "Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.",
      "5": "For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, so shall we also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection,",
      "6": "knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him, so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we should no longer be slaves to sin.",
      "7": "For the one who has died is freed from sin.",
      "8": "Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,",
      "9": "knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death has no further dominion over Him.",
      "10": "For the death He died, He died to sin once for all, but the life He lives, He lives to God.",
      "11": "Likewise, you also consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "12": "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.",
      "13": "Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but yield yourselves to God, as those who are alive from the dead, and your bodies to God as instruments of righteousness.",
      "14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace.",
      "15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? God forbid!",
      "16": "Do you not know that to whom you yield yourselves as slaves to obey, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?",
      "17": "But thanks be to God, for you were slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of teaching to which you were entrusted,",
      "18": "and having been freed from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness.",
      "19": "I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for just as you have yielded your members as slaves to impurity and iniquity leading to more iniquity, even so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness unto holiness.",
      "20": "For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.",
      "21": "What fruit did you have then from the things of which you are now ashamed? The result of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now, having been freed from sin and having become slaves of God, you have fruit unto holiness, and the end is eternal life.",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

    "7": {
      "1": "Do you not know, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?",

      "3": "So then, she will be called an adulteress if she marries another man while her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she would not be an adulteress if she marries another man.",
      "4": "So, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may be married to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, so that we may bear fruit for God.",
      "5": "When we were in the flesh, the passions of sin, through the law, worked in our members to bear fruit leading to death.",
      "6": "But now we are delivered from the law, having died to things in which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter of the law.",
      "7": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid! But I did not know sin, except through the law. I would not have known coveting if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”",
      "8": "But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law sin is dead.",
      "9": "I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.",
      "10": "And the commandment, which was intended for life, proved to be death in me.",
      "11": "For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and killed me through it.",
      "12": "So then, the law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good.",
      "13": "Therefore has that which is good become death unto me? God forbid! Rather, sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was working death in me through that which is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.",
      "14": "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.",
      "15": "For what I am doing, I do not understand, for I do not practice what I will to do, but I do the very thing I hate.",
      "16": "But if I practice what I do not will to do, I agree with the law that it is good.",
      "17": "So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.",
      "18": "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing, for the will to do what is right is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find.",
      "19": "For the good I desire to do, I do not do, but the evil I do not want is what I do.",
      "20": "Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who does it, but sin that lives in me.",
      "21": "I find then a law that when I desire to do good, evil is present with me.",
      "22": "For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man,",
      "23": "but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.",
      "24": "O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?",

      "2": "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.",
      "3": "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and concerning sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,",
      "4": "in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.",

      "6": "To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,",
      "7": "for the carnal mind is hostile toward God, for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be,",
      "8": "and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.",

      "11": "But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit that lives in you.",
      "12": "Therefore, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.",
      "13": "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if through the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.",
      "14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.",
      "15": "For you have not received the spirit of slavery again to fear. But you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.”",

      "17": "and if children, then heirs: heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him.",
      "18": "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us.",
      "19": "The eager expectation of the creation waits for the appearance of the sons of God.",
      "20": "For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but by the will of Him who subjected it, in hope",
      "21": "that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the glorious freedom of the children of God.",
      "22": "We know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.",
      "23": "Not only that, but we also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves while eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.",
      "24": "For we are saved through hope, but hope that is seen is not hope, for why does a man still hope for what he sees?",
