      "1": "These are the words of the Preacher, the son of David and king in Jerusalem.",
      "2": "“Vanity of vanities,”\n    says the Preacher;\n“vanity of vanities,\n    all is vanity.”",
      "3": "What benefit is there to a man in all his labors\n    that he toils under the sun?",
      "4": "A generation comes, and a generation goes,\n    but the earth continually remains.",
      "5": "The sun comes up, and the sun goes down,\n    and hurries to the place where it rises.",
      "6": "It moves to the south,\n    and then moves around to the north;\nthe wind continually travels around,\n    and it keeps turning on its circuit.",
      "7": "All the streams flow into the sea,\n    and the sea is never filled up.\nAnd to the place where the streams flow,\n    there they continually return to flow.",
      "8": "All matters are wearisome;\n    a man is not able to speak to them.\nThe eye is not satisfied with what it sees,\n    and the ear is not content with what it hears.",
      "9": "What has been is the same as what will be,\n    and what has been done is the same as what will be done;\n    there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there a matter where it is said,\n    “See, this is truly new”?\nLong ago in the past\n    every matter has already been in our midst.",
      "11": "There is not a memory for the former things,\n    and moreover, there will not be\na memory for the things coming after,\n    even those things that are yet to come.",
      "12": "I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I set my heart to seek and to investigate with wisdom everything that is done under heaven. It is a burdensome task that God has given to the sons of men, by which they may be occupied.",
      "14": "I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and indeed, all is vanity and like chasing the wind.",
      "15": "What is bent cannot be straightened,\n    and what is missing cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I spoke in my heart, saying, “I have been great and increased in wisdom more than anyone else who has been before me in Jerusalem, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know the folly of ideas and to know foolish behavior, and I know that this as well is like chasing the wind.",
      "18": "For in an abundance of wisdom is an abundance of frustration,\n    and he who increases in knowledge also increases in sorrow."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "And I said in my heart, “Come, and I will test you with selfish pleasures to experience desires.” And notice that this too is vanity.",
      "2": "And I said of frivolous fun, “They are only senseless ideas”; and regarding selfish pleasure, “What purpose is this?”",
      "3": "I investigated how to cheer up my body with wine, while my heart was still guiding me with wisdom, in order to grasp folly until I might experience what is good for sons of men to do under heaven during the number of days that they might have life.",
      "4": "I accomplished great works. I built houses for myself, and planted myself vineyards.",
      "5": "I made for myself royal gardens and parks, and I planted in them all sorts of fruit trees.",
      "6": "I made for myself pools of water to irrigate the forests of growing trees.",
      "7": "I even bought male and female slaves; even some were born to me in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks more than any who had been in Jerusalem before me.",
      "8": "I also gathered for myself silver and gold and treasures of kings and provinces. I obtained singers, both men and women, and the delights of the sons of men, and many concubines.",
      "9": "So I became great and surpassed anyone who had been in Jerusalem before me. All the while my wisdom remained with me.",
      "10": "And everything that my eyes wanted I did not refuse them.\n    And I did not withhold my heart from any selfish pleasure,\nfor my heart was glad from all my efforts;\n    and this was my reward for all my efforts.",
      "11": "Then I turned to all the work that my hands had designed\n    and all the labor that I had toiled to make;\nand notice, all of it was vanity and chasing the wind.\n    And there was no benefit under the sun.",
      "12": "So I turned to consider wisdom,\n    the folly of ideas, and foolish behavior;\nfor what else can a man do who comes after the king?\n    Or what more than those have already done?",
      "13": "Then I saw that there is more benefit in wisdom than in foolishness,\n    more benefit in light than in darkness.",
      "14": "A wise man has eyes in his head so he sees where he walks,\n    but the fool continues in darkness.\nYet I perceived\n    that the same fate overtakes them all.",
      "15": "Then I said in my heart,\n“What happens to the fool will happen to me also.\n    So to what advantage is my wisdom?”\nThen I said to myself,\n    “This also is vanity.”",
      "16": "For there is no lasting memory for the wise or the fool,\n    by which in the coming days everyone will be forgotten.\nHow the wise dies just like the fool!",
      "17": "And I began to hate life for the labor that was done under the sun was contemptible to me, for all of this was vanity and chasing the wind.",
      "18": "And I despised all the toil in which I labored under the sun, which I will give up to the man who comes after me.",
      "19": "And who knows if this man will be wise or a fool? Yet he will gain power over every labor that I have toiled and my use of wisdom under the sun. Also this is vanity.",
      "20": "So I turned to give my heart up to despair concerning all the toil of my labors under the sun.",
      "21": "For there is a man who labors with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet to a man who did not labor for this, he leaves it as his inheritance. This also is vanity and a great distress.",
      "22": "For what becomes of a man with all his labor and with the striving in his heart that he toils under the sun?",
      "23": "For all his days are sorrowful, and his work is a vexation; even at night his heart finds no rest. Also this is fleeting.",
      "24": "There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in his labor. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God.",
      "25": "For who can even eat or have enjoyment more so than I?",
      "26": "For to a man who is pleasing before Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting to give him who is pleasing before God. Also this is vanity and chasing the wind."

      "11": "He has made everything beautiful in its appropriate time. He has also put obscurity in their hearts so that no one comes to know the work that God has done from the beginning to the end.",
      "12": "I experienced that there is nothing better for them than to be glad and do good in their life.",
      "13": "And also that everyone should eat and drink and experience good in all their labor. This is a gift of God.",
      "14": "I have perceived that everything that God has done will be lasting. And to this there is nothing to be added, and from it there is nothing to be taken away. And God has done this so that in His presence men fear Him.",
      "15": "That which is has already been,\n    and what is to come has also already been;\n    and God seeks out what has been driven away.",
      "16": "Moreover I saw what was under the sun:\nIn the place of justice, there was wickedness;\n    and in the place of righteousness, there was wickedness.",
      "17": "I thought in my heart:\nGod will bring judgment\n    to the righteous and the wicked,\nfor there is an appropriate time\n    for every matter and deed.",
      "18": "Then I thought in my heart: Regarding the account of sons of men, God is making clear to them to show that they are but animals.",
      "19": "For what befalls the sons of men befalls animals; as one dies, so dies the other. There is one breath for all of them; there is no advantage for man any more than animals, for all is vanity.",
      "20": "All go to one place: All are from the dust and all return to dust.",
      "21": "Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of animals goes down to the earth?",
      "22": "So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his labor, for that is his reward. For who will bring him to see what will happen after his life?"

      "1": "Again I saw all types of oppression that are done under the sun:\nLook! The tears of the oppressed,\n    and no one was there to comfort them.\nAnd there was force from the hand of the oppressors,\n    and no one was there to comfort them.",
      "2": "And I thought that fortunate were the dead\n    who had already died,\neven more than the living\n    who were still alive.",
      "3": "And still better than both\n    is he who has not been,\nwho has not seen the evil deeds\n    that are done under the sun.",
      "4": "Then I saw that all toil and every skillful work come from one man’s envy of another. This also is vanity and like chasing the wind.",
      "5": "The fool folds his hands\n    and eats his own flesh.",
      "6": "Better is a full hand of quietness\n    than handfuls of toil and chasing the wind.",
      "7": "Again, I saw vanity under the sun:",
      "8": "There is a man who is alone,\n    neither having son or brother,\nand there is not an end to all his toil,\n    and his eyes are not satisfied with riches to say,\n“For whom do I labor\n    and cause my life to lack good things?”\nAlso this is vanity\n    and a burdensome task.",
      "9": "Two are better than one,\n    because there is a good reward for their labor together.",
      "10": "For if they fall,\n    then one will help up his companion.\nBut woe to him who is alone when he falls\n    and has no one to help him up.",
      "11": "Also if two lie down together, then they will keep warm;\n    but how can one keep warm by himself?",
      "12": "And if someone might overpower another by himself,\n    two together can withstand him.\nA threefold cord is not quickly broken.",

      "5": "Better it is that you do not make a vow than you make a vow and not fulfill it.",
      "6": "Do not let your mouth cause you to sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was an error. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?",
      "7": "For when there is an abundance of dreams and futilities, then words increase too. Therefore it is God you should fear.",

      "12": "Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man,\n    whether he eats a little or much;\nbut the abundance of the rich\n    will not let him sleep.",

      "17": "Moreover, in all his days he eats in darkness,\n    while he is greatly irritated in sickness and anger.",
      "18": "This is what I have seen to be good: It is fitting to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life, which God has given to him; for this is his reward.",
      "19": "And also everyone to whom God has given wealth and possessions, and given him power to enjoy them, and to receive his reward and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.",
