      "4": "I thank my God, always mentioning you in my prayers,",
      "5": "whenever I hear of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,",
      "6": "that the sharing of your faith may be most effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you from Christ Jesus.",
      "7": "For we have great joy and encouragement on account of your love, because the hearts of the saints are refreshed through you, brother.",
      "8": "Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you to do that which is proper,",

      "21": "Being convinced of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.",
      "22": "But, in addition, prepare also lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be graciously restored to you.",
      "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
      "24": "as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow laborers.",
