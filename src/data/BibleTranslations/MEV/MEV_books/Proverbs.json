      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:",
      "2": "To know wisdom and instruction,\n    to perceive the words of understanding,",
      "3": "to receive the instruction of wisdom,\n    justice, judgment, and equity;",
      "4": "to give subtlety to the simple,\n    to the young man knowledge and discretion—",
      "5": "a wise man will hear and will increase learning,\n    and a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,",
      "6": "to understand a proverb and the interpretation,\n    the words of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,\n    but fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "My son, hear the instruction of your father,\n    and do not forsake the teaching of your mother;",
      "9": "for they will be a garland of grace on your head,\n    and chains about your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinners entice you,\n    do not consent.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us,\n    let us lie in wait for blood;\n    let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;",
      "12": "let us swallow them up alive as the grave,\n    and whole, as those who go down into the pit;",
      "13": "we will find all kinds of precious possessions;\n    we will fill our houses with spoil;",
      "14": "cast in your lot among us,\n    let us all have one purse”—",
      "15": "my son, do not walk in the way with them,\n    keep your foot from their path;",
      "16": "for their feet run to evil\n    and make haste to shed blood.",
      "17": "Surely in vain the net is spread\n    in the sight of any bird.",
      "18": "They lie in wait for their own blood;\n    they lurk secretly for their own lives.",
      "19": "So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain,\n    which takes away the life of its owners.",
      "20": "Wisdom cries out in the street;\n    she utters her voice in the markets.",
      "21": "She cries at the corner of the streets, in the openings of the gates;\n    she speaks her words in the city, saying:",
      "22": "“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?\n    For the scorners delight in their scorning,\n    and fools hate knowledge.",
      "23": "Turn at my reproof;\n    surely I will pour out my spirit on you;\n    I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I have called and you refused,\n    I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded,",
      "25": "because you neglected all my counsel,\n    and would have none of my reproof,",
      "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity;\n    I will mock when your fear comes,",
      "27": "when your fear comes as desolation\n    and your destruction comes as a whirlwind,\n    when distress and anguish come upon you.",
      "28": "“Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;\n    they will seek me early, but they will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated knowledge\n    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
      "30": "they would have none of my counsel\n    and despised all my reproof.",
      "31": "Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,\n    and be filled with their own devices.",
      "32": "For the turning away of the simple will slay them,\n    and the prosperity of fools will destroy them.",
      "33": "But whoever listens to me will dwell safely,\n    and will be secure from fear of evil.”"

      "5": "then you will understand the fear of the Lord,\n    and find the knowledge of God.",

      "11": "discretion will preserve you;\n    understanding will keep you,",
      "12": "to deliver you from the way of the evil man,\n    from the man who speaks perverse things,",
      "13": "from those who leave the paths of uprightness\n    to walk in the ways of darkness;",
      "14": "who rejoice to do evil,\n    and delight in the perversity of the wicked;",
      "15": "whose ways are crooked,\n    and who are devious in their paths;",
      "16": "to deliver you from the immoral woman,\n    even from the seductress who flatters with her words,",
      "17": "who forsakes the guide of her youth,\n    and forgets the covenant of her God.",
      "18": "For her house leads down to death,\n    and her paths to the departed spirits;",
      "19": "none who go to her return again,\n    nor do they take hold of the paths of life.",
      "20": "So you may walk in the way of good men\n    and keep the paths of the righteous.",
      "21": "For the upright will dwell in the land,\n    and the innocent will remain in it;",
      "22": "but the wicked will be cut off from the earth,\n    and the transgressors will be rooted out of it."

      "11": "My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,\n    nor be weary of His correction;",
      "12": "for whom the Lord loves He corrects,\n    even as a father the son in whom he delights.",
      "13": "Happy is the man who finds wisdom,\n    and the man who gets understanding;",
      "14": "for her benefit is more profitable than silver,\n    and her gain than fine gold.",
      "15": "She is more precious than rubies,\n    and all the things you may desire are not to be compared with her.",
      "16": "Length of days is in her right hand,\n    and in her left hand riches and honor.",
      "17": "Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\n    and all her paths are peace.",

      "25": "Do not be afraid of sudden terror,\n    nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes;",
      "26": "for the Lord will be your confidence,\n    and will keep your foot from being caught.",
      "27": "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,\n    when it is in the power of your hand to do it.",
      "28": "Do not say to your neighbor,\n    “Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give it,”\n    when you have it with you.",
