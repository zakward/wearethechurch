      "2": "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification by the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ:\nGrace to you and peace be multiplied.",
      "3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,",
      "4": "to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away, kept in heaven for you,",
      "5": "who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.",
      "6": "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now, if for a little while, you have had to suffer various trials,",
      "7": "in order that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tried by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ,",
      "8": "whom, having not seen, you love; and in whom, though you do not see Him now, you believe and you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,",
      "9": "receiving as the result of your faith the salvation of your souls.",
      "10": "Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that should come to you have inquired and searched diligently,",
      "11": "seeking the events and time the Spirit of Christ, who was within them, signified when He foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.",
      "12": "It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, concerning the things which are now reported to you by those who have preached the gospel to you through the Holy Spirit, who was sent from heaven—things into which the angels desire to look.",
      "13": "Therefore guard your minds, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
      "14": "As obedient children do not conduct yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance.",
      "15": "But as He who has called you is holy, so be holy in all your conduct,",
      "16": "because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”",
      "17": "And if you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your sojourning.",
      "18": "For you know that you were not redeemed from your vain way of life inherited from your fathers with perishable things, like silver or gold,",
      "19": "but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.",
      "20": "He was foreordained before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you.",
      "21": "Through Him you believe in God who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.",
      "22": "Since your souls have been purified by obedience to the truth through the Spirit unto a genuine brotherly love, love one another deeply with a pure heart,",
      "23": "for you have been born again, not from perishable seed, but imperishable, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.",
      "24": "For\n“All flesh is as grass,\n    and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.\nThe grass withers, and its flower falls away,",
      "25": "but the word of the Lord endures forever.”\nThis is the word that was preached to you."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore put away all wickedness, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking.",
      "2": "As newborn babies, desire the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow,",
      "3": "if it is true that you have experienced that the Lord is good.",
      "4": "Coming to Him as to a living stone who is rejected by men, but chosen by God and precious,",
      "5": "you also, as living stones, are being built up into a spiritual house as a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.",
      "6": "For also it is contained in the Scripture,\n“Look! I lay in Zion\n    a chief cornerstone, elect, precious,\nand he who believes in Him\n    shall never be put to shame.”",
      "7": "Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious. But to those who are disobedient,\n“The stone that the builders rejected\n    has become the cornerstone,”",
      "8": "and,\n“A stone of stumbling,\n    and a rock of offense.”\nThey stumble because they are disobedient to the word, to which also they were appointed.",
      "9": "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may declare the goodness of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.",
      "10": "In times past, you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.",
      "11": "Dearly beloved, I implore you as aliens and refugees, abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.",
      "12": "Live your lives honorably among the Gentiles, so that though they speak against you as evildoers, they shall see your good works and thereby glorify God in the day of visitation.",
      "13": "Submit yourselves to every human authority for the Lord’s sake, whether it be to the king, as supreme,",
      "14": "or to governors, as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and to praise those who do right.",
      "15": "For it is the will of God that by doing right you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.",
      "16": "As free people, do not use your liberty as a covering for evil, but live as servants of God.",
      "17": "Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.",
      "18": "Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh.",
      "19": "For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God a person endures grief, suffering unjustly.",
      "20": "For what credit is it if when you are being beaten for your sins you patiently endure? But if when doing good and suffering for it, you patiently endure, this is favorable before God.",
      "21": "For to this you were called, because Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:",
      "22": "“He committed no sin,\n    nor was deceit found in His mouth.”",
      "23": "When He was reviled, He did not revile back; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but He entrusted Himself to Him who judges righteously.",
      "24": "He Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness. “By His wounds you were healed.”",
      "25": "For you were as sheep going astray, but now have been returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."

      "2": "as they see the purity and reverence of your lives.",
      "3": "Do not let your adorning be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine clothing.",
      "4": "But let it be the hidden nature of the heart, that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.",
      "5": "For in this manner, in the old times, the holy women, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands,",
      "6": "even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You are her children as long as you do right and are not afraid with any terror.",
      "7": "Likewise, you husbands, live considerately with your wives, giving honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they too are also heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.",
      "8": "Finally, be all of one mind, be loving toward one another, be gracious, and be kind.",
      "9": "Do not repay evil for evil, or curse for curse, but on the contrary, bless, knowing that to this you are called, so that you may receive a blessing.",
      "10": "For\n“He who would love life\n    and see good days,\nlet him keep his tongue from evil,\n    and his lips from speaking deceit.",
      "11": "Let him turn away from evil and do good;\n    let him seek peace and pursue it.",
      "12": "For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,\n    and His ears are open to their prayers;\nbut the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”",
      "13": "Who is he who will harm you if you follow that which is good?",
      "14": "But even if you suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. “Do not be afraid of their terror, do not be troubled.”",
      "15": "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to every man who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, with gentleness and fear.",
      "16": "Have a good conscience so that evildoers who speak evil of you and falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.",
      "17": "For it is better, if it is the will of God, that you suffer for doing good than for doing evil.",
      "18": "For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit,",
      "19": "by whom He also went and preached to the spirits in prison,",
      "20": "who in times past were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.",
      "21": "Figuratively this is like baptism, which also saves us now. It is not washing off the dirt from the body, but a response to God from a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,",
      "22": "who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Therefore, since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,",
      "2": "so that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh serving human desires, but the will of God.",
      "3": "For in earlier times of our lives it may have sufficed us to do what the Gentiles like to do, when we walked in immorality: lusts, drunkenness, carousing, debauchery, and abominable idolatries.",
      "4": "They are surprised that you do not join them in the same excess of wild living, and so they speak evil of you.",
      "5": "They will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.",
      "6": "For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, so that even though they might be judged according to men in the flesh, they might live according to God in the spirit.",
      "7": "The end of all things is near. Therefore be solemn and sober so you can pray.",
      "8": "Above all things, have unfailing love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.",
      "9": "Show hospitality to one another without complaining.",
      "10": "As everyone has received a gift, even so serve one another with it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.",
      "11": "If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone serves, let him serve with the strength that God supplies, so that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen.",
      "12": "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though some strange thing happened to you.",
      "13": "But rejoice insofar as you share in Christ’s sufferings, so that you may rejoice and be glad also in the revelation of His glory.",
      "14": "If you are reproached because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.",
      "15": "Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or even as a busybody.",
      "16": "Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God because of it.",
      "17": "For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God, and if it begins first with us, what shall the end be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?",
      "18": "And\n“If the righteous one is scarcely saved,\n    where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?”",
      "19": "So then, let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator, while continuing to do good."
