      "4": "nor pay attention to fables and endless genealogies, which cause debates rather than godly edifying, which is in faith.",
      "5": "Now the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and from sincere faith.",
      "6": "From this, some have lost their way and turned aside to empty talk,",
      "7": "desiring to be teachers of the law, and understanding neither what they say nor what they affirm.",

      "13": "I was previously a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insolent man. But I was shown mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.",
      "14": "The grace of our Lord overflowed with the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst.",
      "16": "But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, first, Jesus Christ might show all patience, as an example to those who were to believe in Him for eternal life.",

      "16": "Without question, great is the mystery of godliness:\nGod was revealed in the flesh,\n    justified in the Spirit,\nseen by angels,\n    preached to the Gentiles,\nbelieved on in the world,\n    taken up into glory."
