      "12": "Thus says the Lord,\n“Though they are at full strength and likewise many,\nEven so, they will be cut off and pass away.\nThough I have afflicted you,\nI will afflict you no longer.",
      "13": "“So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you,\nAnd I will tear off your shackles.”",
      "14": "The Lord has issued a command concerning you:\n“Your name will no longer be perpetuated.\nI will cut off idol and image\nFrom the house of your gods.\nI will prepare your grave,\nFor you are contemptible.”",

      "11": "Where is the den of the lions\nAnd the feeding place of the young lions,\nWhere the lion, lioness and lion’s cub prowled,\nWith nothing to disturb them?",
      "12": "The lion tore enough for his cubs,\nKilled enough for his lionesses,\nAnd filled his lairs with prey\nAnd his dens with torn flesh.",
      "13": "“Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of hosts. “I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.”"

      "1": "Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and pillage;\nHer prey never departs.",

      "4": "All because of the many harlotries of the harlot,\nThe charming one, the mistress of sorceries,\nWho sells nations by her harlotries\nAnd families by her sorceries.",
      "5": "“Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of hosts;\n“And I will lift up your skirts over your face,\nAnd show to the nations your nakedness\nAnd to the kingdoms your disgrace.",
      "6": "“I will throw filth on you\nAnd make you vile,\nAnd set you up as a spectacle.",
      "7": "“And it will come about that all who see you\nWill shrink from you and say,\n‘Nineveh is devastated!\nWho will grieve for her?’\nWhere will I seek comforters for you?”",
      "8": "Are you better than No-amon,\nWhich was situated by the waters of the Nile,\nWith water surrounding her,\nWhose rampart was the sea,\nWhose wall consisted of the sea?",
      "9": "Ethiopia was her might,\nAnd Egypt too, without limits.\nPut and Lubim were among her helpers.",
      "10": "Yet she became an exile,\nShe went into captivity;\nAlso her small children were dashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for her honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound with fetters.",
      "11": "You too will become drunk,\nYou will be hidden.\nYou too will search for a refuge from the enemy.",
      "12": "All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit—\nWhen shaken, they fall into the eater’s mouth.",
      "13": "Behold, your people are women in your midst!\nThe gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;\nFire consumes your gate bars.",
      "14": "Draw for yourself water for the siege!\nStrengthen your fortifications!\nGo into the clay and tread the mortar!\nTake hold of the brick mold!",
      "15": "There fire will consume you,\nThe sword will cut you down;\nIt will consume you as the locust does.\nMultiply yourself like the creeping locust,\nMultiply yourself like the swarming locust.",
      "16": "You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven—\nThe creeping locust strips and flies away.",
      "17": "Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust.\nYour marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers\nSettling in the stone walls on a cold day.\nThe sun rises and they flee,\nAnd the place where they are is not known.",
      "18": "Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria;\nYour nobles are lying down.\nYour people are scattered on the mountains\nAnd there is no one to regather them.",
      "19": "There is no relief for your breakdown,\nYour wound is incurable.\nAll who hear about you\nWill clap their hands over you,\nFor on whom has not your evil passed continually?"
