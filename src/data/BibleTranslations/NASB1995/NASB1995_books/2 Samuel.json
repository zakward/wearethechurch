      "6": "The young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely.",

      "27": "Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.”",

Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet today you charge me with a guilt concerning the woman.",

      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",
      "22": "And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”",
      "24": "Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you sent him away and he is already gone?",
      "25": "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out all that you are doing.”",
      "26": "When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.",
      "27": "So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother.",

      "30": "So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.",
      "31": "Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes and gird on sackcloth and lament before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier.",
      "32": "Thus they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.",
      "33": "The king chanted a lament for Abner and said,\n“Should Abner die as a fool dies?",
      "34": "“Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters;\nAs one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept again over him.",

      "5": "So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest.",

      "7": "Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night.",
      "8": "Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the Lord has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.”",
      "9": "David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,",
      "10": "when one told me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.",
      "11": "How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hand and destroy you from the earth?”",
      "12": "Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."

      "5": "At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.",

      "12": "And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.",
      "13": "Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.",

      "24": "It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act promptly, for then the Lord will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”",

      "3": "then go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.",
      "4": "Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, “Help, O king.”",
      "5": "The king said to her, “What is your trouble?” And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead.",
      "6": "Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled together in the field, and there was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him.",
      "7": "Now behold, the whole family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and destroy the heir also.’ Thus they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”",
      "8": "Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”",
      "9": "The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “O my lord, the king, the iniquity is on me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.”",
      "10": "So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.”",
      "11": "Then she said, “Please let the king remember the Lord your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”",
      "12": "Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”",
      "13": "The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.",
      "14": "For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one will not be cast out from him.",
      "15": "Now the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is that the people have made me afraid; so your maidservant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant.",
      "16": "For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’",
      "17": "Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the Lord your God be with you.’”",
      "18": "Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.”",
      "19": "So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant;",
      "20": "in order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.”",
      "21": "Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will surely do this thing; go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”",
      "22": "Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord, the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”",
      "23": "So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "However the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face.” So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.",
      "25": "Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.",
      "26": "When he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, for it was heavy on him so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king’s weight.",
      "27": "To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.",
      "28": "Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king’s face.",
      "29": "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come.",
      "30": "Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.",
      "31": "Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”",
      "32": "Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there.”’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.”",
      "33": "So when Joab came to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. Thus he came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom."

      "3": "Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but no man listens to you on the part of the king.”",

      "36": "Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward?",
      "37": "Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”",

      "43": "But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt?
