      "3": "“An ox knows its owner,\nAnd a donkey its master’s manger,\nBut Israel does not know,\nMy people do not understand.”",
      "4": "Alas, sinful nation,\nPeople weighed down with iniquity,\nOffspring of evildoers,\nSons who act corruptly!\nThey have abandoned the Lord,\nThey have despised the Holy One of Israel,\nThey have turned away from Him.",
      "5": "Where will you be stricken again,\nAs you continue in your rebellion?\nThe whole head is sick\nAnd the whole heart is faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head\nThere is nothing sound in it,\nOnly bruises, welts and raw wounds,\nNot pressed out or bandaged,\nNor softened with oil.",

      "10": "Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou rulers of Sodom;\nGive ear to the instruction of our God,\nYou people of Gomorrah.",
      "11": "“What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?”\nSays the Lord.\n“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nAnd the fat of fed cattle;\nAnd I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats.",

      "22": "Your silver has become dross,\nYour drink diluted with water.",
      "23": "Your rulers are rebels\nAnd companions of thieves;\nEveryone loves a bribe\nAnd chases after rewards.\nThey do not defend the orphan,\nNor does the widow’s plea come before them.",
      "24": "Therefore the Lord God of hosts,\nThe Mighty One of Israel, declares,\n“Ah, I will be relieved of My adversaries\nAnd avenge Myself on My foes.",
