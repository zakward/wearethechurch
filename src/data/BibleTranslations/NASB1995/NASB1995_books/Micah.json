      "1": "The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, O peoples, all of you;\nListen, O earth and all it contains,\nAnd let the Lord God be a witness against you,\nThe Lord from His holy temple.",
      "3": "For behold, the Lord is coming forth from His place.\nHe will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains will melt under Him\nAnd the valleys will be split,\nLike wax before the fire,\nLike water poured down a steep place.",
      "5": "All this is for the rebellion of Jacob\nAnd for the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the rebellion of Jacob?\nIs it not Samaria?\nWhat is the high place of Judah?\nIs it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country,\nPlanting places for a vineyard.\nI will pour her stones down into the valley\nAnd will lay bare her foundations.",
      "7": "All of her idols will be smashed,\nAll of her earnings will be burned with fire\nAnd all of her images I will make desolate,\nFor she collected them from a harlot’s earnings,\nAnd to the earnings of a harlot they will return.",
      "8": "Because of this I must lament and wail,\nI must go barefoot and naked;\nI must make a lament like the jackals\nAnd a mourning like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wound is incurable,\nFor it has come to Judah;\nIt has reached the gate of my people,\nEven to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Tell it not in Gath,\nWeep not at all.\nAt Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust.",
      "11": "Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness.\nThe inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape.\nThe lamentation of Beth-ezel: “He will take from you its support.”",
      "12": "For the inhabitant of Maroth\nBecomes weak waiting for good,\nBecause a calamity has come down from the Lord\nTo the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the chariot to the team of horses,\nO inhabitant of Lachish—\nShe was the beginning of sin\nTo the daughter of Zion—\nBecause in you were found\nThe rebellious acts of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give parting gifts\nOn behalf of Moresheth-gath;\nThe houses of Achzib will become a deception\nTo the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "Moreover, I will bring on you\nThe one who takes possession,\nO inhabitant of Mareshah.\nThe glory of Israel will enter Adullam.",
      "16": "Make yourself bald and cut off your hair,\nBecause of the children of your delight;\nExtend your baldness like the eagle,\nFor they will go from you into exile."

      "1": "Woe to those who scheme iniquity,\nWho work out evil on their beds!\nWhen morning comes, they do it,\nFor it is in the power of their hands.",

      "3": "Therefore thus says the Lord,\n“Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity\nFrom which you cannot remove your necks;\nAnd you will not walk haughtily,\nFor it will be an evil time.",
      "4": "“On that day they will take up against you a taunt\nAnd utter a bitter lamentation and say,\n‘We are completely destroyed!\nHe exchanges the portion of my people;\nHow He removes it from me!\nTo the apostate He apportions our fields.’",
      "5": "“Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line\nFor you by lot in the assembly of the Lord.",
      "6": "‘Do not speak out,’ so they speak out.\nBut if they do not speak out concerning these things,\nReproaches will not be turned back.",
      "7": "“Is it being said, O house of Jacob:\n‘Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?\nAre these His doings?’\nDo not My words do good\nTo the one walking uprightly?",
      "8": "“Recently My people have arisen as an enemy—\nYou strip the robe off the garment\nFrom unsuspecting passers-by,\nFrom those returned from war.",
      "9": "“The women of My people you evict,\nEach one from her pleasant house.\nFrom her children you take My splendor forever.",
      "10": "“Arise and go,\nFor this is no place of rest\nBecause of the uncleanness that brings on destruction,\nA painful destruction.",
      "11": "“If a man walking after wind and falsehood\nHad told lies and said,\n‘I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,’\nHe would be spokesman to this people.",

      "3": "Who eat the flesh of my people,\nStrip off their skin from them,\nBreak their bones\nAnd chop them up as for the pot\nAnd as meat in a kettle.”",
      "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord,\nBut He will not answer them.\nInstead, He will hide His face from them at that time\nBecause they have practiced evil deeds.",
      "5": "Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;\nWhen they have something to bite with their teeth,\nThey cry, “Peace,”\nBut against him who puts nothing in their mouths\nThey declare holy war.",
      "6": "Therefore it will be night for you—without vision,\nAnd darkness for you—without divination.\nThe sun will go down on the prophets,\nAnd the day will become dark over them.",
      "7": "The seers will be ashamed\nAnd the diviners will be embarrassed.\nIndeed, they will all cover their mouths\nBecause there is no answer from God.",
      "8": "On the other hand I am filled with power—\nWith the Spirit of the Lord—\nAnd with justice and courage\nTo make known to Jacob his rebellious act,\nEven to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house of Israel,\nWho abhor justice\nAnd twist everything that is straight,",
      "10": "Who build Zion with bloodshed\nAnd Jerusalem with violent injustice.",
      "11": "Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,\nHer priests instruct for a price\nAnd her prophets divine for money.\nYet they lean on the Lord saying,\n“Is not the Lord in our midst?\nCalamity will not come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore, on account of you\nZion will be plowed as a field,\nJerusalem will become a heap of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest."

      "3": "And He will judge between many peoples\nAnd render decisions for mighty, distant nations.\nThen they will hammer their swords into plowshares\nAnd their spears into pruning hooks;\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,\nAnd never again will they train for war.",
      "4": "Each of them will sit under his vine\nAnd under his fig tree,\nWith no one to make them afraid,\nFor the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.",
      "5": "Though all the peoples walk\nEach in the name of his god,\nAs for us, we will walk\nIn the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.",

      "9": "“Now, why do you cry out loudly?\nIs there no king among you,\nOr has your counselor perished,\nThat agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?",
      "10": "“Writhe and labor to give birth,\nDaughter of Zion,\nLike a woman in childbirth;\nFor now you will go out of the city,\nDwell in the field,\nAnd go to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued;\nThere the Lord will redeem you\nFrom the hand of your enemies.",
      "11": "“And now many nations have been assembled against you\nWho say, ‘Let her be polluted,\nAnd let our eyes gloat over Zion.’",
      "12": "“But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord,\nAnd they do not understand His purpose;\nFor He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.",
      "13": "“Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,\nFor your horn I will make iron\nAnd your hoofs I will make bronze,\nThat you may pulverize many peoples,\nThat you may devote to the Lord their unjust gain\nAnd their wealth to the Lord of all the earth."
