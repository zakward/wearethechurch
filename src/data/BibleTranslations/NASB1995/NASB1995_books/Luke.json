      "64": "And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak in praise of God.",
      "65": "Fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.",
      "66": "All who heard them kept them in mind, saying, “What then will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him.",
      "67": "And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:",
      "68": "“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,\nFor He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,",
