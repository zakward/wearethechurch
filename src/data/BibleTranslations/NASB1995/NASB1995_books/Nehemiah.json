      "1": "The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.\nNow it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol,",
      "2": "that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.",
      "5": "I said, “I beseech You, O Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,",
      "6": "let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father’s house have sinned.",
      "7": "We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples;",
      "9": "but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.’",
      "10": "They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.",
      "11": "O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man.”\nNow I was the cupbearer to the king."

      "1": "And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.",
      "2": "So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid.",
      "3": "I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?”",
      "4": "Then the king said to me, “What would you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.",
      "5": "I said to the king, “If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”",
      "6": "Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, “How long will your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time.",
      "7": "And I said to the king, “If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,",
      "8": "and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go.” And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me.",
      "9": "Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.",
      "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.",
      "11": "So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.",
      "12": "And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.",
      "13": "So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire.",
      "14": "Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.",
      "15": "So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.",
      "16": "The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work.",
      "17": "Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.”",
      "18": "I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us arise and build.” So they put their hands to the good work.",
      "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”",
      "20": "So I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem.”"

      "1": "Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews.",
      "2": "He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?”",
      "3": "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down!”",
      "4": "Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity.",
      "5": "Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders.",
      "6": "So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.",
      "7": "Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry.",
      "8": "All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it.",
      "9": "But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.",
      "10": "Thus in Judah it was said,\n“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,\nYet there is much rubbish;\nAnd we ourselves are unable\nTo rebuild the wall.”",
      "11": "Our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.”",
      "12": "When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,”",
      "13": "then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears and bows.",
      "14": "When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses.”",
      "15": "When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.",
      "16": "From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah.",
      "17": "Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.",
      "18": "As for the builders, each wore his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me.",
      "19": "I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another.",
      "20": "At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”",
      "21": "So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared.",
      "22": "At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day.”",
      "23": "So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each took his weapon even to the water."

      "1": "Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.",
      "2": "For there were those who said, “We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live.”",
      "3": "There were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine.”",
      "4": "Also there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and our vineyards.",
      "5": "Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words.",
      "7": "I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, “You are exacting usury, each from his brother!” Therefore, I held a great assembly against them.",
      "8": "I said to them, “We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a word to say.",
      "9": "Again I said, “The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?",
      "10": "And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury.",
      "11": "Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine and the oil that you are exacting from them.”",
      "12": "Then they said, “We will give it back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say.” So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.",
      "13": "I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised the Lord. Then the people did according to this promise.",
      "14": "Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor’s food allowance.",
      "15": "But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.",
      "16": "I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.",
      "17": "Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.",
      "18": "Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine were furnished in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor’s food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people.",
      "19": "Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."

    "6": {
      "1": "Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,",
      "2": "then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me.",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”",
      "4": "They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way.",
      "5": "Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports.",
      "7": "You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together.”",
      "8": "Then I sent a message to him saying, “Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind.”",
      "9": "For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands.",
      "10": "When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”",
      "11": "But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”",
      "12": "Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
      "13": "He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me.",
      "14": "Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me.",
      "15": "So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.",
      "16": "When all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.",
      "17": "Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.",
      "18": "For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.",
      "19": "Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."

      "3": "Then I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house.”",
      "4": "Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built.",

      "42": "and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader,",
      "43": "and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.",
      "44": "On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.",
      "45": "For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon.",
      "46": "For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God.",
      "47": "So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron."

      "5": "had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.",
      "6": "But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king,",
      "7": "and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.",
      "8": "It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.",
      "9": "Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.",
      "10": "I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field.",
      "11": "So I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts.",
      "12": "All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine and oil into the storehouses.",
      "13": "In charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen.",
      "14": "Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services.",
      "15": "In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of loads, and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day.

      "16": "Also men of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them to the sons of Judah on the sabbath, even in Jerusalem.",

      "19": "It came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load would enter on the sabbath day.",
      "20": "Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.",
      "21": "Then I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.",
      "22": "And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness.",
