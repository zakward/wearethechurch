      "1": "The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:",
      "2": "Hear this, O elders,\nAnd listen, all inhabitants of the land.\nHas anything like this happened in your days\nOr in your fathers’ days?",
      "3": "Tell your sons about it,\nAnd let your sons tell their sons,\nAnd their sons the next generation.",
      "4": "What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;\nAnd what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten;\nAnd what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.",
      "5": "Awake, drunkards, and weep;\nAnd wail, all you wine drinkers,\nOn account of the sweet wine\nThat is cut off from your mouth.",
      "6": "For a nation has invaded my land,\nMighty and without number;\nIts teeth are the teeth of a lion,\nAnd it has the fangs of a lioness.",
      "7": "It has made my vine a waste\nAnd my fig tree splinters.\nIt has stripped them bare and cast them away;\nTheir branches have become white.",
      "8": "Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth\nFor the bridegroom of her youth.",
      "9": "The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off\nFrom the house of the Lord.\nThe priests mourn,\nThe ministers of the Lord.",
      "10": "The field is ruined,\nThe land mourns;\nFor the grain is ruined,\nThe new wine dries up,\nFresh oil fails.",
      "11": "Be ashamed, O farmers,\nWail, O vinedressers,\nFor the wheat and the barley;\nBecause the harvest of the field is destroyed.",
      "12": "The vine dries up\nAnd the fig tree fails;\nThe pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree,\nAll the trees of the field dry up.\nIndeed, rejoicing dries up\nFrom the sons of men.",
      "13": "Gird yourselves with sackcloth\nAnd lament, O priests;\nWail, O ministers of the altar!\nCome, spend the night in sackcloth\nO ministers of my God,\nFor the grain offering and the drink offering\nAre withheld from the house of your God.",
      "14": "Consecrate a fast,\nProclaim a solemn assembly;\nGather the elders\nAnd all the inhabitants of the land\nTo the house of the Lord your God,\nAnd cry out to the Lord.",
      "15": "Alas for the day!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\nAnd it will come as destruction from the Almighty.",
      "16": "Has not food been cut off before our eyes,\nGladness and joy from the house of our God?",
      "17": "The seeds shrivel under their clods;\nThe storehouses are desolate,\nThe barns are torn down,\nFor the grain is dried up.",
      "18": "How the beasts groan!\nThe herds of cattle wander aimlessly\nBecause there is no pasture for them;\nEven the flocks of sheep suffer.",
      "19": "To You, O Lord, I cry;\nFor fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness\nAnd the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.",
      "20": "Even the beasts of the field pant for You;\nFor the water brooks are dried up\nAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."

      "1": "Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nAnd sound an alarm on My holy mountain!\nLet all the inhabitants of the land tremble,\nFor the day of the Lord is coming;\nSurely it is near,",
      "2": "A day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness.\nAs the dawn is spread over the mountains,\nSo there is a great and mighty people;\nThere has never been anything like it,\nNor will there be again after it\nTo the years of many generations.",
      "3": "A fire consumes before them\nAnd behind them a flame burns.\nThe land is like the garden of Eden before them\nBut a desolate wilderness behind them,\nAnd nothing at all escapes them.",
      "4": "Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;\nAnd like war horses, so they run.",
      "5": "With a noise as of chariots\nThey leap on the tops of the mountains,\nLike the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble,\nLike a mighty people arranged for battle.",
      "6": "Before them the people are in anguish;\nAll faces turn pale.",
      "7": "They run like mighty men,\nThey climb the wall like soldiers;\nAnd they each march in line,\nNor do they deviate from their paths.",
      "8": "They do not crowd each other,\nThey march everyone in his path;\nWhen they burst through the defenses,\nThey do not break ranks.",
      "9": "They rush on the city,\nThey run on the wall;\nThey climb into the houses,\nThey enter through the windows like a thief.",
      "10": "Before them the earth quakes,\nThe heavens tremble,\nThe sun and the moon grow dark\nAnd the stars lose their brightness.",
      "11": "The Lord utters His voice before His army;\nSurely His camp is very great,\nFor strong is he who carries out His word.\nThe day of the Lord is indeed great and very awesome,\nAnd who can endure it?",
      "12": "“Yet even now,” declares the Lord,\n“Return to Me with all your heart,\nAnd with fasting, weeping and mourning;",
      "13": "And rend your heart and not your garments.”\nNow return to the Lord your God,\nFor He is gracious and compassionate,\nSlow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness\nAnd relenting of evil.",
      "14": "Who knows whether He will not turn and relent\nAnd leave a blessing behind Him,\nEven a grain offering and a drink offering\nFor the Lord your God?",
      "15": "Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nConsecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,",
      "16": "Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,\nAssemble the elders,\nGather the children and the nursing infants.\nLet the bridegroom come out of his room\nAnd the bride out of her bridal chamber.",
      "17": "Let the priests, the Lord’s ministers,\nWeep between the porch and the altar,\nAnd let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord,\nAnd do not make Your inheritance a reproach,\nA byword among the nations.\nWhy should they among the peoples say,\n‘Where is their God?’”",
      "18": "Then the Lord will be zealous for His land\nAnd will have pity on His people.",
      "19": "The Lord will answer and say to His people,\n“Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine and oil,\nAnd you will be satisfied in full with them;\nAnd I will never again make you a reproach among the nations.",
      "20": "“But I will remove the northern army far from you,\nAnd I will drive it into a parched and desolate land,\nAnd its vanguard into the eastern sea,\nAnd its rear guard into the western sea.\nAnd its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up,\nFor it has done great things.”",
      "21": "Do not fear, O land, rejoice and be glad,\nFor the Lord has done great things.",
      "22": "Do not fear, beasts of the field,\nFor the pastures of the wilderness have turned green,\nFor the tree has borne its fruit,\nThe fig tree and the vine have yielded in full.",
      "23": "So rejoice, O sons of Zion,\nAnd be glad in the Lord your God;\nFor He has given you the early rain for your vindication.\nAnd He has poured down for you the rain,\nThe early and latter rain as before.",
      "24": "The threshing floors will be full of grain,\nAnd the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil.",
      "25": "“Then I will make up to you for the years\nThat the swarming locust has eaten,\nThe creeping locust, the stripping locust and the gnawing locust,\nMy great army which I sent among you.",
      "26": "“You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied\nAnd praise the name of the Lord your God,\nWho has dealt wondrously with you;\nThen My people will never be put to shame.",
      "27": "“Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,\nAnd that I am the Lord your God,\nAnd there is no other;\nAnd My people will never be put to shame.",
      "28": "“It will come about after this\nThat I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;\nAnd your sons and daughters will prophesy,\nYour old men will dream dreams,\nYour young men will see visions.",
      "29": "“Even on the male and female servants\nI will pour out My Spirit in those days.",
      "30": "“I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,\nBlood, fire and columns of smoke.",
      "31": "“The sun will be turned into darkness\nAnd the moon into blood\nBefore the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.",
      "32": "“And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the Lord\nWill be delivered;\nFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\nThere will be those who escape,\nAs the Lord has said,\nEven among the survivors whom the Lord calls."

      "3": "“They have also cast lots for My people,\nTraded a boy for a harlot\nAnd sold a girl for wine that they may drink.",
      "4": "Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head.",

      "17": "Then you will know that I am the Lord your God,\nDwelling in Zion, My holy mountain.\nSo Jerusalem will be holy,\nAnd strangers will pass through it no more.",
      "18": "And in that day\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,\nAnd the hills will flow with milk,\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;\nAnd a spring will go out from the house of the Lord\nTo water the valley of Shittim.",
      "19": "Egypt will become a waste,\nAnd Edom will become a desolate wilderness,\nBecause of the violence done to the sons of Judah,\nIn whose land they have shed innocent blood.",
