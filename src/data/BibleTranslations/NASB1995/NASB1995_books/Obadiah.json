    "1": {
      "1": "The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom—\nWe have heard a report from the Lord,\nAnd an envoy has been sent among the nations saying,\n“Arise and let us go against her for battle”—",
      "2": "“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;\nYou are greatly despised.",
      "3": "“The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,\nYou who live in the clefts of the rock,\nIn the loftiness of your dwelling place,\nWho say in your heart,\n‘Who will bring me down to earth?’",
      "4": "“Though you build high like the eagle,\nThough you set your nest among the stars,\nFrom there I will bring you down,” declares the Lord.",
      "5": "“If thieves came to you,\nIf robbers by night—\nO how you will be ruined!—\nWould they not steal only until they had enough?\nIf grape gatherers came to you,\nWould they not leave some gleanings?",
      "6": "“O how Esau will be ransacked,\nAnd his hidden treasures searched out!",
      "7": "“All the men allied with you\nWill send you forth to the border,\nAnd the men at peace with you\nWill deceive you and overpower you.\nThey who eat your bread\nWill set an ambush for you.\n(There is no understanding in him.)",
      "8": "“Will I not on that day,” declares the Lord,\n“Destroy wise men from Edom\nAnd understanding from the mountain of Esau?",
      "9": "“Then your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman,\nSo that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.",
      "10": "“Because of violence to your brother Jacob,\nYou will be covered with shame,\nAnd you will be cut off forever.",
      "11": "“On the day that you stood aloof,\nOn the day that strangers carried off his wealth,\nAnd foreigners entered his gate\nAnd cast lots for Jerusalem—\nYou too were as one of them.",
      "12": "“Do not gloat over your brother’s day,\nThe day of his misfortune.\nAnd do not rejoice over the sons of Judah\nIn the day of their destruction;\nYes, do not boast\nIn the day of their distress.",
      "13": "“Do not enter the gate of My people\nIn the day of their disaster.\nYes, you, do not gloat over their calamity\nIn the day of their disaster.\nAnd do not loot their wealth\nIn the day of their disaster.",
      "14": "“Do not stand at the fork of the road\nTo cut down their fugitives;\nAnd do not imprison their survivors\nIn the day of their distress.",
      "15": "“For the day of the Lord draws near on all the nations.\nAs you have done, it will be done to you.\nYour dealings will return on your own head.",
      "16": "“Because just as you drank on My holy mountain,\nAll the nations will drink continually.\nThey will drink and swallow\nAnd become as if they had never existed.",
      "17": "“But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape,\nAnd it will be holy.\nAnd the house of Jacob will possess their possessions.",
      "18": "“Then the house of Jacob will be a fire\nAnd the house of Joseph a flame;\nBut the house of Esau will be as stubble.\nAnd they will set them on fire and consume them,\nSo that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau,”\nFor the Lord has spoken.",
      "19": "Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau,\nAnd those of the Shephelah the Philistine plain;\nAlso, possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,\nAnd Benjamin will possess Gilead.",
      "20": "And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel,\nWho are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,\nAnd the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\nWill possess the cities of the Negev.",
      "21": "The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion\nTo judge the mountain of Esau,\nAnd the kingdom will be the Lord’s."
