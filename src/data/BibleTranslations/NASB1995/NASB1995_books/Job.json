  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east.",
      "4": "His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.",
      "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Then Satan answered the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "8": "The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.”",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing?",
      "10": "Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.",
      "11": "But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face.”",
      "12": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "14": "a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,",
      "15": "and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "16": "While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "17": "While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "18": "While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "19": "and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”",
      "20": "Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped.",
      "21": "He said,\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I shall return there.\nThe Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.\nBlessed be the name of the Lord.”",
      "22": "Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord.",
      "2": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "3": "The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”",
      "4": "Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.",
      "5": "However, put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face.”",
      "6": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.”",
      "7": "Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.",
      "8": "And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!”",
      "10": "But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.",
      "11": "Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him.",
      "12": "When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky.",
      "13": "Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.",
      "2": "And Job said,",
      "3": "“Let the day perish on which I was to be born,\nAnd the night which said, ‘A boy is conceived.’",
      "4": "“May that day be darkness;\nLet not God above care for it,\nNor light shine on it.",
      "5": "“Let darkness and black gloom claim it;\nLet a cloud settle on it;\nLet the blackness of the day terrify it.",
      "6": "“As for that night, let darkness seize it;\nLet it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nLet it not come into the number of the months.",
      "7": "“Behold, let that night be barren;\nLet no joyful shout enter it.",
      "8": "“Let those curse it who curse the day,\nWho are prepared to rouse Leviathan.",
      "9": "“Let the stars of its twilight be darkened;\nLet it wait for light but have none,\nAnd let it not see the breaking dawn;",
      "10": "Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb,\nOr hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "“Why did I not die at birth,\nCome forth from the womb and expire?",
      "12": "“Why did the knees receive me,\nAnd why the breasts, that I should suck?",
      "13": "“For now I would have lain down and been quiet;\nI would have slept then, I would have been at rest,",
      "14": "With kings and with counselors of the earth,\nWho rebuilt ruins for themselves;",
      "15": "Or with princes who had gold,\nWho were filling their houses with silver.",
      "16": "“Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be,\nAs infants that never saw light.",
      "17": "“There the wicked cease from raging,\nAnd there the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "“The prisoners are at ease together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.",
      "19": "“The small and the great are there,\nAnd the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "“Why is light given to him who suffers,\nAnd life to the bitter of soul,",
      "21": "Who long for death, but there is none,\nAnd dig for it more than for hidden treasures,",
      "22": "Who rejoice greatly,\nAnd exult when they find the grave?",
      "23": "“Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\nAnd whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "“For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,\nAnd my cries pour out like water.",
      "25": "“For what I fear comes upon me,\nAnd what I dread befalls me.",
      "26": "“I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,\nAnd I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,",
      "2": "“If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient?\nBut who can refrain from speaking?",
      "3": "“Behold you have admonished many,\nAnd you have strengthened weak hands.",
      "4": "“Your words have helped the tottering to stand,\nAnd you have strengthened feeble knees.",
      "5": "“But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;\nIt touches you, and you are dismayed.",
      "6": "“Is not your fear of God your confidence,\nAnd the integrity of your ways your hope?",
      "7": "“Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?\nOr where were the upright destroyed?",
      "8": "“According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity\nAnd those who sow trouble harvest it.",
      "9": "“By the breath of God they perish,\nAnd by the blast of His anger they come to an end.",
      "10": "“The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion,\nAnd the teeth of the young lions are broken.",
      "11": "“The lion perishes for lack of prey,\nAnd the whelps of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "“Now a word was brought to me stealthily,\nAnd my ear received a whisper of it.",
      "13": "“Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,\nWhen deep sleep falls on men,",
      "14": "Dread came upon me, and trembling,\nAnd made all my bones shake.",
      "15": "“Then a spirit passed by my face;\nThe hair of my flesh bristled up.",
      "16": "“It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;\nA form was before my eyes;\nThere was silence, then I heard a voice:",
      "17": "‘Can mankind be just before God?\nCan a man be pure before his Maker?",
      "18": "‘He puts no trust even in His servants;\nAnd against His angels He charges error.",

    },
    "5": {
      "1": "“Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?\nAnd to which of the holy ones will you turn?",

      "5": "“His harvest the hungry devour\nAnd take it to a place of thorns,\nAnd the schemer is eager for their wealth.",
      "6": "“For affliction does not come from the dust,\nNor does trouble sprout from the ground,",
      "7": "For man is born for trouble,\nAs sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "“But as for me, I would seek God,\nAnd I would place my cause before God;",

      "17": "“Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves,\nSo do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.",
      "18": "“For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;\nHe wounds, and His hands also heal.",
      "19": "“From six troubles He will deliver you,\nEven in seven evil will not touch you.",
      "20": "“In famine He will redeem you from death,\nAnd in war from the power of the sword.",

      "22": "“You will laugh at violence and famine,\nAnd you will not be afraid of wild beasts.",
      "23": "“For you will be in league with the stones of the field,\nAnd the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.",
