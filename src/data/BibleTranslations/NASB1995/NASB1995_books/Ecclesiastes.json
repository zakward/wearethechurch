      "1": "The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.",
      "2": "“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,\n“Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.”",
      "3": "What advantage does man have in all his work\nWhich he does under the sun?",
      "4": "A generation goes and a generation comes,\nBut the earth remains forever.",
      "5": "Also, the sun rises and the sun sets;\nAnd hastening to its place it rises there again.",
      "6": "Blowing toward the south,\nThen turning toward the north,\nThe wind continues swirling along;\nAnd on its circular courses the wind returns.",
      "7": "All the rivers flow into the sea,\nYet the sea is not full.\nTo the place where the rivers flow,\nThere they flow again.",
      "8": "All things are wearisome;\nMan is not able to tell it.\nThe eye is not satisfied with seeing,\nNor is the ear filled with hearing.",
      "9": "That which has been is that which will be,\nAnd that which has been done is that which will be done.\nSo there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there anything of which one might say,\n“See this, it is new”?\nAlready it has existed for ages\nWhich were before us.",
      "11": "There is no remembrance of earlier things;\nAnd also of the later things which will occur,\nThere will be for them no remembrance\nAmong those who will come later still.",
      "12": "I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.",
      "14": "I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I said to myself, “Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.",
      "18": "Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself.” And behold, it too was futility.",
      "2": "I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”",
      "3": "I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.",
      "4": "I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself;",
      "5": "I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees;",
      "6": "I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.",
      "7": "I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men—many concubines.",
      "9": "Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me.",
      "10": "All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor.",
      "11": "Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.",
      "12": "So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly; for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has already been done?",
      "13": "And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.",
      "14": "The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both.",
      "15": "Then I said to myself, “As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?” So I said to myself, “This too is vanity.”",
      "16": "For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man as with the fool, inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die!",
      "17": "So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind.",
      "18": "Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me.",
      "19": "And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity.",
      "20": "Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun.",
      "21": "When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil.",
      "22": "For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun?",
      "23": "Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.",
      "24": "There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God.",
      "25": "For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him?",
      "26": "For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind."

      "4": "A time to weep and a time to laugh;\nA time to mourn and a time to dance.",

      "9": "What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils?",
      "10": "I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.",
      "11": "He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.",
      "12": "I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one’s lifetime;",
      "13": "moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor—it is the gift of God.",
      "14": "I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has so worked that men should fear Him.",
      "15": "That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by.",
      "16": "Furthermore, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness.",
      "17": "I said to myself, “God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man,” for a time for every matter and for every deed is there.",
      "18": "I said to myself concerning the sons of men, “God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.”",
      "19": "For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity.",
      "20": "All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust.",
      "21": "Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?",
      "22": "I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?"

      "1": "Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.",
      "2": "So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.",
      "3": "But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.",
      "4": "I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind.",
      "5": "The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.",
      "6": "One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.",
      "7": "Then I looked again at vanity under the sun.",
      "8": "There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, “And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?” This too is vanity and it is a grievous task.",
      "9": "Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.",
      "10": "For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up.",
      "11": "Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone?",
      "12": "And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.",
      "13": "A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction.",
      "14": "For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.",
      "15": "I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him.",
      "16": "There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind."

      "3": "For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words.",
      "4": "When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!",
      "5": "It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.",
      "6": "Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?",
      "7": "For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.",
      "8": "If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them.",

      "10": "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity.",
      "11": "When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?",
      "12": "The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.",
      "13": "There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt.",
      "14": "When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him.",
      "15": "As he had come naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.",
      "16": "This also is a grievous evil—exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?",
      "17": "Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger.",
      "18": "Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one’s labor in which he toils under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward.",
      "19": "Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.",

      "3": "If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, “Better the miscarriage than he,",

      "10": "Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is.",
      "11": "For there are many words which increase futility. What then is the advantage to a man?",
      "12": "For who knows what is good for a man during his lifetime, during the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?"

      "11": "Wisdom along with an inheritance is good\nAnd an advantage to those who see the sun.",
      "12": "For wisdom is protection just as money is protection,\nBut the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.",
      "13": "Consider the work of God,\nFor who is able to straighten what He has bent?",
      "14": "In the day of prosperity be happy,\nBut in the day of adversity consider—\nGod has made the one as well as the other\nSo that man will not discover anything that will be after him.",

      "20": "Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins.",
      "21": "Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you.",
      "22": "For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others.",
      "23": "I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me.",

There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear.",
