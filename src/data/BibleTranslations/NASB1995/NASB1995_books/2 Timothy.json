      "4": "longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.",
      "5": "For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.",
      "6": "For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.",
      "7": "For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.",
      "8": "Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,",
      "9": "who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,",
      "10": "but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,",

      "12": "For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.",
      "13": "Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.",
      "15": "You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.",
      "16": "The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;",

      "17": "and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,",
      "18": "men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.",
      "19": "Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.”",
      "20": "Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.",
      "21": "Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.",

      "7": "always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
      "8": "Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.",
      "9": "But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes’s and Jambres’s folly was also.",

      "5": "But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.",
