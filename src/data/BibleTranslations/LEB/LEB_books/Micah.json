      "1": "The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, that he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:",
      "2": "Hear, all you peoples;\n    give heed, O earth and its fullness.\nAnd let the Lord Yahweh be against you as a witness,\n    the Lord from his holy temple.",
      "3": "For behold, Yahweh is coming out from his place,\n    and he will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains will melt under him\n    and the valleys will burst open,\nlike wax before the fire,\n    like water rushing down a slope.",
      "5": "All this is for the rebellion of Jacob,\n    and for the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the rebellion of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\nAnd what are the high places of Judah?\n    Are they not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "So I will make Samaria as a heap of rubble in the field,\n    a place for planting a vineyard.\nAnd I will pour down her stones into the valley\n    and uncover her foundations.",
      "7": "Then all her idols will be broken in pieces,\n    and all her prostitution wages will be burned in the fire,\n    and all her idols I will make a desolation,\nFor from the wage of a prostitute she gathered them,\n    and to the wage of a prostitute they will return.",
      "8": "On account of this I will lament and wail.\n    I will go about barefoot and naked.\nI will make a lamentation like the jackals,\n    and a mourning ceremony like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wounds are incurable,\n    because it has come to Judah.\n    It has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Do not tell it in Gath;\n    you must not weep at all.\nIn Beth-le-Aphrah\n    roll yourself in dust.",
      "11": "Pass on, you inhabitants of Shaphir,\n    in naked shame.\nThe inhabitants of Zaanan do not come forth;\n    the wailing of Beth-ha-Ezel will take its protection from you.",
      "12": "For the inhabitants of Maroth\n    writhed for good,\nbecause disaster has come down from Yahweh\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the chariot to the team of horses,\n    O inhabitants of Lachish;\nit is the beginning of sin\n    for the daughter of Zion,\nfor the transgressions of Israel\n    were found in you.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth-Gath;\nthe houses of Achzib will be a deception\n    to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring the conqueror upon you,\n    O inhabitants of Mareshah;\nthe glory of Israel\n    will come to Adullam.",
      "16": "Make yourselves bald\n    and cut off your hair\n    for the children of your pleasure.\nExpand your baldness as the eagle,\n    for they will go into exile away from you."

      "3": "Therefore, thus says Yahweh: Look! I am planning disaster against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks. You will not walk proudly, for it is a time of disaster.",
      "4": "In that day they will raise a proverb against you,\n    and will wail a bitter wailing, saying,\n“We are utterly ruined;\n    he exchanges the portion of my people.\nHow he removes it from me;\n    he apportions our field to an apostate.”",
      "5": "Therefore you will have no one casting a line by lot\n    in the assembly of Yahweh.",
      "6": "“Do not preach!” they are preaching.\n    They should not preach to these;\n    disgrace will not overtake us.",
      "7": "Should this be said, O house of Jacob?\n    Is the patience of Yahweh shortened?\n    Are these his deeds?\nAre my words not pleasing\n    to him who walks upright?",
      "8": "But recently my people have risen up as an enemy;\n    from before the cloak you strip off the robe\nfrom those passing by in confidence,\n    returning from war.",
      "9": "You have driven out the women of my people\n    from the houses of their pleasure.\nFrom their children you have taken away\n    my glory forever.",

      "11": "If a man walks about in a spirit of deception and lies,\n    saying “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,”\n    then he would be a preacher for this people!",
      "12": "I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob;\n    I will surely gather together the remainder of Israel.\nI will set them like sheep of Bozrah.\nLike a herd in the midst of their pasture\n    they will be in tumult from people.",
      "13": "The one who breaks out before them goes up;\n    they break through and pass the gate,\n    going out through it.\nTheir king passes before them,\n    Yahweh at their head."

      "3": "and who eat the flesh of my people,\n    and strip their skin from them,\nand break their bones,\n    and chop them like meat in the pot,\n    and like flesh in the midst of a cooking pot.”",
      "4": "Then they will cry to Yahweh,\n    but he will not answer them.\nHe will hide his face from them at that time,\n    when they have made their deeds evil.",
      "5": "Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets\n    who are leading my people astray,\nwho are biting with their teeth\n    and proclaim, “Peace,”\nbut whoever puts nothing into their mouths\n    they declare war against.",
      "6": "Therefore it will be as night to you, without vision,\n    and darkness to you, without divination.\nAnd the sun will set on the prophets,\n    and the day will grow dark over them.",
      "7": "Then the seers will be disgraced,\n    and those practicing divination will be put to shame.\nAll of them will cover their lips,\n    for there is no reply from God.",
      "8": "But I, I am filled with power,\n    with the Spirit of Yahweh,\nand with justice and might,\n    to declare to Jacob his rebellion,\n    and to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Hear this, O rulers of the house of Jacob\n    and leaders of the house of Israel,\nthose detesting justice\n    and perverting all that is right,",
      "10": "he who builds Zion with blood\n    and Jerusalem with wickedness.",
      "11": "Its rulers judge for a bribe;\n    its priests teach for a price;\n    its prophets practice divination for money.\nBut they lean on Yahweh, saying,\n    “Is not Yahweh in our midst?\n    Disaster will not come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore on account of you\n    Zion will be plowed as a field,\nand Jerusalem will be a heap of rubble,\n    and the temple mount as a high place in a forest."

      "1": "And it will be that at the end of those days,\nthe mountain of Yahweh\n    will be established as the highest of the mountains,\nand it will be lifted up above the hills,\n    and people will stream to it.",
      "2": "And many nations will come and say,\n“Come! Let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,\n    and to the temple of the God of Jacob,\nthat he may teach us his ways,\n    and that we may walk in his paths,”\nfor the law will go out from Zion,\n    and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.",

      "9": "So then, why do you shout a loud shout?\n    Is there no king in you?\nHas your counselor perished\n    that pangs like a woman in labor have seized you?",
      "10": "Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,\n    like a woman in labor.\nFor now you will go forth from the city,\n    and you will camp in the field;\n    you will go to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued;\n    there Yahweh will redeem you\n    from the hand of your enemies.",
      "11": "And now, many nations are gathered against you\n    who are saying, ‘Let her be defiled,\n    and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.’",
      "12": "But they do not know the thoughts of Yahweh,\n    and they do not understand his plan,\nthat he has gathered them as sheaves\n    to his threshing floor.",
      "13": "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion,\n    for your horn I will make as iron\n    and your hooves as bronze.\nAnd you will break many peoples in pieces,\n    and their gain you will devote to destruction to Yahweh,\n    and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.”"
