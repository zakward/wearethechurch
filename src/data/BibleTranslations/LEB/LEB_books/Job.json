  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.",
      "2": "And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "Then his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.",
      "4": "And his sons used to go and hold a feast at each other’s house on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
      "5": "Then when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send, and he would sanctify them. Thus he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of all of them, because Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do all the time.",
      "6": "And it happened one day that the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan also came into their midst.",
      "7": "So Yahweh said to Satan, “From where have you come?”\nThen Satan answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”",
      "8": "So Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.”",
      "9": "Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?",
      "10": "Have you not put a fence around him and his household and around all that belongs to him on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has increased in the land.",
      "11": "But, on the other hand, stretch out your hand and touch all that belongs to him and see whether he will curse you to your face.”",
      "12": "So Yahweh said to Satan, “Look, all that belongs to him is in your power. Only do not stretch out your hand against him.” So Satan went out from Yahweh’s presence.",
      "13": "And then there was one day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.",
      "14": "And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding beside them.",
      "15": "Then the Sabeans attacked, and they took them, and they slew the servants by the edge of the sword. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”",
      "16": "While this one was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”",
      "17": "While this one was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants by the edge of the sword, but I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”",
      "18": "At the time this one was speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.",
      "19": "And behold, a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house so that it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”",
      "20": "Then Job arose and tore his outer garment and shaved his head; then he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.",
      "21": "Then he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Yahweh gives, and Yahweh takes. Let Yahweh’s name be blessed.”",
      "22": "In all this, Job did not sin and did not charge God with wrongdoing."

    "2": {
      "1": "And then one day the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan also came into their midst to present himself before Yahweh.",
      "2": "So Yahweh asked Satan, “From where have you come?”\nAnd Satan answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”",
      "3": "So Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness even though you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.”",
      "4": "Then Satan answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that that man has he will give for his life.",
      "5": "But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, and see whether he will curse you to your face.”",
      "6": "So Yahweh said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power. Only spare his life.”",
      "7": "So Satan went out from Yahweh’s presence, and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.",
      "8": "So he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? Curse God and die.”",
      "10": "So he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.",
      "11": "Thus Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So each set out from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met together to come to console him and to comfort him.",
      "12": "Thus they lifted up their eyes from afar, but they did not recognize him, so they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment and threw dust on their heads toward the sky.",
      "13": "Then they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.",
      "2": "Thus Job spoke up and said,",
      "3": "“Let the day perish on which I was born,\nand the night that said, ‘A man-child is conceived.’",
      "4": "Let that day become darkness;\nmay God not seek it from above,\nnor may daylight shine on it.",
      "5": "Let darkness and deep shadow claim it;\nlet clouds settle on it;\nlet them terrify it with the blackness of day.",
      "6": "Let darkness seize that night;\nlet it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nlet it not enter among the number of the months.",
      "7": "Look, let that night become barren;\nlet a joyful song not enter it.",
      "8": "Let those who curse the day curse it,\nthose who are skilled at rousing Leviathan.",
      "9": "Let the stars of its dawn be dark;\nlet it hope for light but there be none,\nand let it not see the eyelids of dawn",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,\nnor did it hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "“Why did I not die at birth?\nWhy did I not come forth from the womb and expire?",
      "12": "Why did the knees receive me\nand the breasts, that I could suck?",
      "13": "For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace;\nI would be asleep; then I would be at rest",
      "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth,\nwho rebuild ruins for themselves,",
      "15": "or with high officials who have gold,\nwho fill up their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Or why was I not hidden like a miscarriage,\nlike infants who did not see the light?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from troubling,\nand there the weary are at rest;",
      "18": "the prisoners are at ease together;\nthey do not hear the oppressor’s voice.",
      "19": "The small and the great are there,\nand the slave is free from his masters.",
      "20": "“Why does he give light to one in misery\nand life to those bitter of soul,",
      "21": "who wait for death, but it does not come,\nand search for it more than for treasures,",
      "22": "who rejoice exceedingly,\nand they are glad when they find the grave?",
      "23": "Why does he give light to a man whose way is hidden,\nand God has fenced him in all around?",
      "24": "For my sighing comes before my bread,\nand my groanings gush forth like water",
      "25": "because the dread that I feel has come upon me,\nand what I feared befalls me.",
      "26": "I am not at ease, and I am not at peace,\nand I do not have rest, thus turmoil has come.”"

      "4": "Your words have raised up the one who stumbles,\nand you have strengthened knees giving way.",
      "5": "But now it has come to you, and you are worn out;\nit touches you, and you are horrified.",
      "6": "Is not your fear in God your confidence?\nIs not your hope even the integrity of your ways?",
      "7": "“Think now, who has perished who is innocent?\nOr where are the upright destroyed?",
      "8": "Just as I have seen, plowers of mischief\nand sowers of trouble will reap it.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish,\nand by the blast of his anger they come to an end.",
      "10": "The roar of the lion and the voice of a lion in its prime,\nand the teeth of the young lions are broken.",
      "11": "The lion is perishing without prey,\nand the lion’s whelps are scattered.",
      "12": "“And a word came stealing to me,\nand my ear received the whisper from it.",
