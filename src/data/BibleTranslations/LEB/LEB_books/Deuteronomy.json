      "3": "And it was in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the Israelites according to all that Yahweh had instructed him to speak to them.",
      "4": "This happened after defeating Sihon king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who was reigning in Ashtaroth in Edrei.",
      "5": "On the other side of the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law, saying:",
      "6": "“Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.",
      "7": "Turn now and move on, and go into the hill of the Amorites and to all of the neighboring regions in the Jordan Valley in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, into the land of the Canaanites and into the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.",
      "8": "Look, I have set the land before you; go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them and to their offspring after them.’",

      "11": "Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, may he add to you as you are now a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he promised you.",
      "12": "How can I bear you by myself, your burden and your load and your strife?",
      "13": "Choose for yourselves wise and discerning and knowledgeable men for each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’",
      "14": "“And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’",
      "15": "And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes.",
      "16": "And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘hear out your fellow men, and then judge fairly between a man and between his brother and between his opponent who is a resident alien.",
      "17": "You must not be partial in your judgment; hear out the small person as also the great person; do not be intimidated by any person, because the judgment is God’s; and the case that is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it out.’",
      "18": "And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do.",

      "23": "The plan was good in my opinion, and so I took from among you twelve men, one from each tribe.",

      "36": "except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons because he followed Yahweh unreservedly.’",

      "41": "“You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on his battle gear, and you regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.",
      "42": "So Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated before your enemies.”’",
      "43": "So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the command of Yahweh; you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.",
      "44": "The Amorites living in the hill country went out to oppose you and chased you as a swarm of wild honey bees do; and so they beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.",
      "45": "So you returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay any attention to you.",

      "5": "Do not get involved in battle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot’s breadth of it; since I have given Mount Seir as a possession for Esau.",

      "12": "The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from among themselves, as Israel did with respect to the land of their possession that Yahweh gave to them.)",
      "13": "So now arise and cross over the wadi of Zered yourselves; and so we crossed the wadi of Zered.",
      "14": "Now the length of time that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until the time when we crossed the wadi of Zered was thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; that is, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them.",
      "15": "The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.",

      "18": "‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab today at Ar.",
      "19": "When you approach the border of the Ammonites, you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.",
      "20": "(It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it previously, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,",
      "21": "a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,",
      "22": "just as he did for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them and dispossessed them, and then they settled in their place up to this day.",
      "23": "And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place.",
      "24": "Arise, set out and cross over the wadi of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of it, and engage with him in battle.",
      "25": "This day I will begin to place the dread of you and the fear of you before the peoples under all the heavens. They will hear the report about you, and so they will shake and tremble because of you.’",
      "26": "“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; I sent terms of peace, saying,",
      "27": "‘Let me cross through your land and only along the road I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.",
      "28": "Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.",
      "29": "Just as the descendants of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.’",
      "30": "But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made him obstinate in order to give him into your hand, just as he has now done.",
      "31": "Yahweh said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give over to you Sihon and his land; begin to take possession of his land.’",

      "36": "From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon and the city that was in the wadi on up to Gilead, there was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Yahweh our God gave everything to us.",

      "3": "And so Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to him.",
      "4": "And we captured all of his towns at that time; there was not a city that we did not take from them.",
      "5": "All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars, apart from very many of the villages of the open country.",
      "6": "And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.",

      "12": "And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.",
      "13": "And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim.",

      "11": "And so you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, dark with a very thick cloud.",

      "34": "Or has a god ever attempted to go to take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation, using trials and signs and wonders and war, with an outstretched arm and with great and awesome deeds, like all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?",
      "35": "You yourselves were shown this wonder in order for you to acknowledge that Yahweh is the God; there is no other God besides him.",
