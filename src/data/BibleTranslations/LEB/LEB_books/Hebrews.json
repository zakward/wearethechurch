      "3": "who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power. When he had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,",
      "4": "having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.",
      "5": "For to which of the angels did he ever say,\n“You are my son,\n    today I have begotten you,”\nand again,\n“I will be his father,\n    and he will be my son”?",
      "6": "And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,\n“And let all the angels of God worship him.”",
      "7": "And concerning the angels he says,\n“The one who makes his angels winds,\nand his servants a flame of fire,”",
      "8": "but concerning the Son,\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\nand the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom.",

      "12": "and like a robe you will roll them up,\nand like a garment they will be changed;\nbut you are the same, and your years will not run out.”",
      "13": "But to which of the angels has he ever said,\n“Sit down at my right hand,\nuntil I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”",

      "3": "how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard,",
      "4": "while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.",
      "5": "For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.",
      "6": "But someone testified somewhere, saying,\n“What is man, that you remember him,\n    or the son of man, that you care for him?",
      "7": "You made him for a short time lower than the angels;\n    you crowned him with glory and honor;",
      "8": "you subjected all things under his feet.\nFor in subjecting all things, he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,",
      "9": "but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from God he might taste death on behalf of everyone.",
      "10": "For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.",
      "11": "For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,",

      "13": "And again,\n“I will trust in him.”\nAnd again,\n“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”",
      "14": "Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,",

      "4": "For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all things is God.",
      "5": "And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,",
      "6": "but Christ was faithful as a son over his house, whose house we are, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.",
      "7": "Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,",
      "8": "do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,\n    in the day of testing in the wilderness,",
      "9": "where your fathers tested me by trial\n    and saw my works",
      "10": "for forty years.\nTherefore I was angry with this generation,\n    and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,\nand they do not know my ways.’",

      "13": "But encourage one another day by day, as long as it is called “today,” so that none of you become hardened by the deception of sin.",

      "17": "And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?",
      "18": "And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?",
      "19": "And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."

      "3": "For we who have believed enter into rest, just as he has said,\n“As I swore in my anger,\n‘They will never enter into my rest.’”\nAnd yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.",
      "4": "For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”",
      "5": "and in this passage again, ‘They will never enter into my rest.’”",
      "6": "Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,",
      "7": "again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts.”",
      "8": "For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.",
      "9": "Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.",
      "10": "For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God did from his own works.",
      "11": "Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.",
      "12": "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.",
      "13": "And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom we must give our account.",
      "14": "Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.",
      "15": "For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.",

      "3": "and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins for himself also, as well as for the people.",
      "4": "And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.",
      "5": "Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,\n“You are my Son, today I have begotten you,”",

      "11": "Concerning this we have much to say and it is difficult to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.",
      "12": "For indeed, although you ought to be teachers by this time, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and you have need of milk, not solid food.",
      "13": "For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.",
      "14": "But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil."

      "2": "teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.",
      "3": "And this we will do, if God permits.",
      "4": "For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,",
      "5": "and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,",
      "6": "and having fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, because they have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.",
      "7": "For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people for whose sake it is also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.",
      "8": "But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to a curse, whose end is for burning.",
      "9": "But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and belonging to salvation.",
      "10": "For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name by having served the saints, and continuing to serve them.",
      "11": "And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end,",
      "12": "in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.",
      "13": "For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,",
      "14": "saying,\n“Surely I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply you.”",
      "15": "And so, by persevering, he obtained the promise.",
      "16": "For people swear by what is greater than themselves, and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them.",
      "17": "In the same way God, because he wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed it with an oath,",
      "18": "in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us,",
      "19": "which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,",
      "20": "where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, because he became a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."

      "3": "without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time.",

      "5": "And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although they are descended from Abraham.",
      "6": "But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.",

      "8": "And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.",
      "9": "And, so to speak, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.",
      "10": "For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.",
      "11": "Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?",
      "12": "For when the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.",
      "13": "For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.",
      "14": "For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.",
      "15": "And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,",
      "16": "who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.",
      "17": "For it is testified,\n“You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”",
      "18": "For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness",
      "19": "(for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.",
      "20": "And by as much as this was not without an oath (for these on the one hand have become priests without an oath,",
      "21": "but he with an oath by the one who said to him,\n“The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,\n    ‘You are a priest forever’”),",

      "25": "Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.",

      "27": "who does not need every day like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself.",

      "3": "For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was necessary for this one also to have something that he offers.",
      "4": "Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are those who offer the gifts according to the law,",
      "5": "who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”",
      "6": "But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.",
      "7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second.",
      "8": "For in finding fault with them he says,\n“Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,\n    when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel\n    and with the house of Judah,",

      "8": "The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, while the first tent was still in existence,",
      "9": "which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,",

      "14": "how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?",
      "15": "And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.",
      "16": "For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.",
      "17": "For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.",

      "23": "Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.",

      "13": "from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.",
      "14": "For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.",

      "25": "not abandoning our meeting together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging each other, and by so much more as you see the day drawing near.",
      "26": "For if we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,",
      "27": "but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.",
      "28": "Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.",
      "29": "How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace?",
