      "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,",
      "2": "and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,",
      "5": "because I hear about your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.",
      "6": "I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ.",
      "7": "For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
      "8": "Therefore, although I have great confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,",
      "9": "instead I appeal to you because of love, since I am such a one as Paul, now an old man and also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.",
      "10": "I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I became the father of during my imprisonment, Onesimus.",
      "11": "Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me,",
      "12": "whom I have sent back to you himself, that is, my heart,",
      "13": "whom I wanted to keep with me, in order that he might serve me on behalf of you during my imprisonment for the gospel.",
      "14": "But apart from your consent, I wanted to do nothing, in order that your good deed might be not as according to necessity, but according to your own free will.",
      "15": "For perhaps because of this, he was separated from you for a time, in order that you might have him back forever,",
      "16": "no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
      "17": "If therefore you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me.",
      "18": "But if in anything he has caused you loss or owes you anything, charge this to my account.",
      "19": "I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay it back, lest I mention to you that you owe me even your very self besides.",
      "20": "Yes, brother, I ought to have some benefit of you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
      "21": "Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even beyond what I say.",
      "22": "At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.",
      "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
      "24": "and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.",
      "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
