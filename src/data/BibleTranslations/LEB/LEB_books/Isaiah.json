      "3": "An ox knows its owner\n    and a donkey the manger of its master.\nIsrael does not know;\n    my people do not understand.",
      "4": "Ah, sinful nation,\n    a people heavy with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\n    children who deal corruptly.\nThey have forsaken Yahweh;\n    they have despised the holy one of Israel.\n        They are estranged and gone backward.",
      "5": "Why do you want to be beaten again?\n    You continue in rebellion.\nThe whole of the head is sick,\n    and the whole of the heart is faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot and up to the head\n    there is no health in it;\nbruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,\n    and they have not been bound up\n    and not softened with the oil.",
      "7": "Your country is desolate,\n    your cities are burned with fire;\nAs for your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence,\n    and it is desolate, like devastation by foreigners.",
      "8": "And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard,\n    like a shelter in a cucumber field,\n    like a city that is besieged.",
      "9": "If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors,\n    we would have been as few as Sodom,\n    we would have become like Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom!\n    Listen to the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!",

      "12": "When you come to appear before me,\n    who asked for this from your hand:\n    you trampling my courts?",
      "13": "You must not continue to bring offerings of futility,\n    incense—it is an abomination to me;\nnew moon and Sabbath, the calling of a convocation—\n    I cannot endure iniquity with solemn assembly.",
      "14": "Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;\n    they have become to me like a burden,\n    I am not able to bear them.",

      "20": "But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword.\nFor the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.”",
      "21": "How has a faithful city become like a whore?\n    Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.",
      "22": "Your silver has become as dross;\n    Your wine is diluted with waters.",
      "23": "Your princes are rebels\n    and companions of thieves.\nEvery one loves a bribe\n    and runs after gifts.\nThey do not defend the orphan\n    and the legal dispute of the widow does not come before them.",
      "24": "Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:\n“Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies,\n    and I will avenge myself on my foes.",
      "25": "And I will turn my hand against you;\nI will purify your dross like lye,\n    and I will remove all of your tin.",
      "26": "And I will restore your judges, as at the first,\n    and your counselors, as at the beginning.\nAfter this you will be called the city of righteousness,\n    faithful city.",
      "27": "Zion will be redeemed by justice,\n    and those of her who repent, by righteousness.",
      "28": "But the destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together,\n    and those who forsake Yahweh will perish.",
      "29": "For you will be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted,\n    and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.",
      "30": "For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves,\n    and like a garden where there is no water for her.",
      "31": "And the strong man shall become like tinder,\n    and his work like a spark.\nAnd both of them shall burn together,\n    and there is not one to quench them.”"
