      "6": "“I have cut off nations;\n    their strongholds are deserted.\nI have laid waste their streets,\n    so that none pass through.\nTheir cities have been destroyed\n    and are without a man, without an inhabitant.",
      "7": "I have said, ‘Surely she will fear me;\n    she will accept discipline.\nThen her dwelling place will not be cut down,\n    nor all that I have brought upon her.’\nSurely they rise early;\n    they make all their deeds corrupt.",
      "8": "“Therefore, wait for me”—a declaration of Yahweh—\n    “for the day of my rising as a witness.\nFor my decision is to gather nations,\n    to assemble kingdoms,\n    to pour out my wrath upon them, all my burning anger.\nFor by the fire of my anger all the land shall be consumed.",
