      "46": "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)",
      "47": "And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!”",
      "48": "And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.",
      "49": "But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”",

      "56": "among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.",
      "57": "Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself.",

      "62": "Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,",
      "63": "saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’",
      "64": "Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”",
      "65": "Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.”",
      "66": "So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone."

      "3": "Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.",
      "4": "And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men.",
      "5": "But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
      "6": "He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.",
      "7": "And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.”",
