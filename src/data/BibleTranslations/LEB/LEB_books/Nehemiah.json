      "1": "The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.\nIt happened in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself was in the citadel in Susa,",
      "2": "and one of my brothers, Hanani, came with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped the captivity and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They replied to me, “The survivors in the province who have survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned in the fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard these words, I sat and wept and mourned for days, and I was fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.",
      "5": "I said, “O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and awesome one who keeps the covenant and loyal love for the ones who love him and for those who keep his commands.",
      "6": "Please, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying before you by day and by night for your servants, the Israelites, and confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have sinned against you. I and my father’s house have sinned.",
      "7": "We have certainly offended you and have not kept the commands, regulations, and judgments that you have commanded your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Please, remember the word that you have commanded to your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you act unfaithfully I will scatter you all among the nations.",
      "9": "But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even though all of your outcasts are at the furthest parts of heaven, I will gather them and bring them to the place which I have chosen to make my name dwell.’",
      "10": "They are your servants and your people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.",
      "11": "O Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to revere in your name. Please, let your servant be successful this day and give him compassion before this man.”\nI was cupbearer for the king."

      "1": "It happened in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. And I had never been sad before the king.",
      "2": "So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad since you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart.” And I was very much afraid.",
      "3": "I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city of my ancestors’ burial site is ruined and her gates are consumed by fire?”",
      "4": "Then the king said to me, “What is your request?” So I prayed to the God of the heavens.",
      "5": "Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your presence, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ burial sites, so that I may rebuild it.”",
      "6": "With the queen sitting beside him, the king said to me, “How long will your journey be and when will you return?” So it pleased the king and he sent me, and I set for him an appointed time.",
      "7": "Then I said to the king, “If it is good for the king, let letters be given to me for the governors in the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass until I come to Judah.",

      "9": "I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and I gave them the letters of the king. Then the king sent troop commanders and horses with me.",
      "10": "But when Sanballat the Horonite and the Ammonite servant Tobiah heard this, they were greatly displeased that a person had come to seek the welfare of the Israelites.",
      "11": "I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.",
      "12": "I got up during the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anybody what my God put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. No animal was with me except the animal that I was riding on.",
      "13": "I went out during the night at the gate of the valley by the Dragon spring and to the Dung Gate. And I examined the walls in Jerusalem and its gates that had been destroyed by the fire.",
      "14": "I crossed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to cross over.",
      "15": "So I went up by the valley during the night and was examining the wall. Then I returned and came to the Valley Gate and returned.",
      "16": "The prefects did not know where I had gone and what I was doing. I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the workers.",
      "17": "Then I said to them, “You see the misery that we are in, that Jerusalem is ruined and its gates burned by the fire. Come, build the walls of Jerusalem and we shall no longer be a disgrace.”",
      "18": "I told them of the good hand of my God that was upon me and surely the words of the king that were spoken to me. And they said, “Let us arise and build!” And they strengthened their hands for this good work.",
      "19": "But Sanballat the Horonite, the Ammonite servant Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard it, and they mocked and despised us, saying, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”",
      "20": "Then I answered and said to them, “The God of the heavens himself will let us succeed, and we his servants shall arise and build. But for you there is no share, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.”"

      "5": "Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you. They have provoked the builders to anger.",
      "6": "So we rebuilt the wall, and all of the wall was joined up to half its height. For the people had a heart to do it.",
      "7": "Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem were going forward and the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.",
      "8": "So all of them plotted together to come fight against Jerusalem and to make trouble for it.",
      "9": "So we prayed to our God and set up a guard against them day and night.",
      "10": "But Judah said, “The strength of the carriers is failing, and there is too much dirt, and we are not able to build at the wall.”",
      "11": "Then our enemies said, “They will not know nor see until we come upon them and will kill them and stop the work.”",
      "12": "When the Jews who lived beside them came, they said to us ten times, “From all of the places where they live, they will come up against us.”",
      "13": "I stationed the people behind the deepest part of the wall in the open places according to their families, with their swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "And I looked, got up, and said to the nobles, prefects, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”",
      "15": "It happened when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, that God had frustrated it, and we all returned to the wall—each to his work.",
      "16": "From that day, half of my servants were working on craftsmanship, half were holding spears, small shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the whole house of Judah.",
      "17": "The ones who were building the wall and the ones who carried the materials were carrying in one hand while doing the task, and with the other hand were grasping a weapon.",
      "18": "Each of the builders had his sword tied to his side while building. And the man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.",
      "19": "I said to the nobles, to the prefects, and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widespread, and we are spread out over the wall far from each other.",
      "20": "Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come together to us there. Our God will fight for us.”",
      "21": "So we labored at the work, and half of them were holding the spears from dawn until the stars came out.",
      "22": "At the time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they will be a guard for us in the night and work in the day.”",
      "23": "So neither I nor my brothers nor my young men nor the men of the guard who were behind me took off our clothes. Each one kept his weapon even in the water."

      "2": "There were those who were saying, “Our sons and daughters, we are many. We must get grain so that we may eat and live.”",
      "3": "There were also those saying, “We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses so that we can get grain in the famine.”",
      "4": "And there were those who were saying, “We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the tax of the king.",
      "5": "Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our sons are like their sons. Look, we are subduing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and there are some from our daughters being molested. We are powerless, and our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "I was very angry when I heard their shouts and these words.",
      "7": "I thought over this in my heart, and then I quarreled with the nobles and the prefects. I said to them, “You yourselves are taking interest from your own brother!” So I called the great assembly against them,",
      "8": "and I said to them: “We ourselves have bought back our brothers the Jews who were sold to the nations as we were able. But now you yourselves have sold your brothers so they may be sold to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say.",
      "9": "So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the disgrace from the nations, our enemies?",
      "10": "Also, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please stop taking this interest.",
      "11": "Please restore to them this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, their houses, and the interest on the money, the grain, the grape juice, and the olive oil that you have been taking from them.”",
      "12": "So they said, “We will restore it and will not request anything more. So we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests and made them take an oath to do this promise.",
      "13": "I also shook out my garment and said, “This is how God will shake out everyone from his house who will not keep this promise. So this is how his possessions will be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised Yahweh, and the people kept this promise.",
      "14": "Moreover, from the appointed day I was made their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years. My brothers and I did not eat the food allowance of the governor.",
      "15": "The former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and they took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels. Also, their servants controlled the people, but I did not do so because of the fear of God.",
      "16": "I also devoted myself to the work of this wall, and we did not buy land. All of my servants were gathered for the work.",
      "17": "One hundred and fifty men, prefects and Jews, and those who came to us from the nations around us, were at my table.",
      "18": "Now what was prepared each day for me was one ox, six choice sheep, and birds. And every ten days all kinds of wine were made. But for this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor because the slavery was too heavy on this people.",
      "19": "Remember me for good, my God, all that I have done for this people."

      "1": "Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not erected doors in the gates—",
      "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they planned to do evil to me.",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you all?”",
      "4": "And they sent a message to me four times like this, and I returned an answer like this to them.",
      "5": "And Sanballat sent his servant with an open letter, another word like this to me a fifth time, in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written, “It has been reported among the nations, and Gashmu also is saying it, that you and the Jews are considering rebellion. Therefore, truly you are building the wall and you are becoming their king, according to these words.",
      "7": "You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now it will be proclaimed to the king according to these words. Now, come and we will plan together.”",
      "8": "So I sent to him saying, “None of these words you have spoken has happened. You are indeed saying things created in your own mind”—",
      "9": "for all of them sought to frighten us, saying, “their hands will not do the work.” And now, God, strengthen my hands.",
      "10": "Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, and he said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you—during the night they are coming to kill you.”",
      "11": "But I said, “Should a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple so that he can save his life? I will not go in!”",
      "12": "Then I look and realized God had not sent him; rather, he had spoken the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
      "13": "For this reason he was hired: to frighten me so that I would act and sin, so that they would have a bad report so they could taunt me.",
      "14": "Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to their works, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the remainder of the prophets who were frightening me.",
      "15": "So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.",
      "16": "When our enemies heard of this, all of the nations surrounding us were afraid and lost their confidence. They knew that this work had been done with the help of our God.",
      "17": "Also, in those days the nobles of Judah increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah returned to them.",
      "18": "For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan took as a wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.",
