      "3": "what we have seen and heard, we announce to you also, in order that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "And these things we write, in order that our joy may be complete.",
      "5": "And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light and there is no darkness in him at all.",
      "6": "If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.",
      "7": "But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.",
      "8": "If we say that we do not have sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.",

      "3": "And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.",
      "4": "The one who says “I have come to know him,” and does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person.",
      "5": "But whoever keeps his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him.",
      "6": "The one who says that he resides in him ought also to walk just as that one walked.",
      "7": "Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message which you have heard.",
      "8": "Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light already is shining.",

      "10": "The one who loves his brother resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.",
      "11": "But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.",

I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one.",
      "15": "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,",
      "16": "because everything that is in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessions—is not from the Father, but is from the world.",
      "17": "And the world is passing away, and its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.",
      "18": "Children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, by which we know that it is the last hour.",
      "19": "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out, in order that it might be shown that all of them are not of us.",

      "21": "I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because every lie is not of the truth.",
      "22": "Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.",
      "23": "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.",
      "24": "As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.",

      "28": "And now, little children, remain in him, so that whenever he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming.",

      "3": "And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure.",
      "4": "Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.",

      "8": "The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil.",
      "9": "Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.",
      "10": "By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother.",
      "11": "For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another,",
      "12": "not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother. And for what reason did he violently murder him? Because his deeds were evil and the deeds of his brother were righteous.",
      "13": "Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you.",
      "14": "We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.",
      "15": "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him.",
      "16": "We have come to know love by this: that he laid down his life on behalf of us, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers.",
      "17": "But whoever has the world’s material possessions and observes his brother in need and shuts his heart against him, how does the love of God reside in him?",
      "18": "Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.",
      "19": "By this we know that we are of the truth and will convince our heart before him,",
      "20": "that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart and knows all things.",
      "21": "Dear friends, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God,",
      "22": "and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight.",
      "23": "And this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he commanded us.",
      "24": "And the one who keeps his commandments resides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he resides in us: by the Spirit whom he has given to us."

      "2": "By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,",
      "3": "and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.",
      "4": "You are from God, little children, and have conquered them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.",
      "5": "They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world and the world listens to them.",
      "6": "We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.",

      "8": "The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.",
      "9": "By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God sent his one and only Son into the world in order that we may live through him.",
      "10": "In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.",
      "11": "Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.",
      "12": "No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us and his love is perfected in us.",
      "13": "By this we know that we reside in him and he in us: that he has given us of his Spirit.",
      "14": "And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.",
      "15": "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God resides in him and he in God.",
      "16": "And we have come to know and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and the one who resides in love resides in God, and God resides in him.",
      "17": "By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so also are we in this world.",
      "18": "There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear includes punishment, and the one who is afraid has not been perfected in love.",
      "19": "We love, because he first loved us.",
      "20": "If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar, for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen is not able to love God whom he has not seen.",
      "21": "And this is the commandment we have from him: that the one who loves God should love his brother also."

      "3": "For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,",
      "4": "because everyone who is fathered by God conquers the world.\nAnd this is the victory which has conquered the world: our faith.",
      "5": "Now who is the one who conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?",
      "6": "This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.",
      "7": "For there are three that testify,",
      "8": "the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.",
      "9": "If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son.",
      "10": "(The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)",
      "11": "And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.",
      "12": "The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.",
      "13": "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life.",
      "14": "And this is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.",
      "15": "And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.",
      "16": "If anyone should see his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and he will grant life to him, to those who sin not leading to death. (There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should ask about that.",

      "19": "We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.",
      "20": "And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, in order that we may know the one who is true, and we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life.",
