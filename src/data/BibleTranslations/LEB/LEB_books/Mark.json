    "1": {
      "1": "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.",
      "2": "Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,\n“Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,\n    who will prepare your way,",
      "3": "the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,\n    ‘Prepare the way of the Lord,\n    make straight his paths!’”",
      "4": "John was there baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
      "5": "And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.",
      "6": "And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "And he was preaching, saying, “One who is more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.",
      "8": "I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.",
      "10": "And immediately as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.",
      "11": "And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”",
      "12": "And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.",
      "13": "And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.",
      "14": "And after John had been taken into custody, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God",
      "15": "and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”",
      "16": "And as he was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).",
      "17": "And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you become fishers of people.”",
      "18": "And immediately they left their nets and followed him.",
      "19": "And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets.",
      "20": "And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went away after him.",
      "21": "And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue.",
      "22": "And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.",
      "23": "And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,",
      "24": "saying, “Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”",
      "26": "And after convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.",
      "27": "And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”",
      "28": "And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.",
      "29": "And so then he departed from the synagogue and came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.",
      "30": "Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.",
      "31": "And he came and raised her up by taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.",
      "32": "Now when it was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.",
      "33": "And the whole town was gathered together at the door.",
      "34": "And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.",
      "35": "And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.",
      "36": "And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him.",
      "37": "And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”",
      "38": "And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.”",
      "39": "And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.",
      "40": "And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down, saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”",
      "41": "And becoming angry, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.”",
      "42": "And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean.",
      "43": "And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.",
      "44": "And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.",
      "45": "But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions."

    "2": {
      "1": "And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it became known that he was at home.",
      "2": "And many had gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.",
      "3": "And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.",
      "4": "And when they were not able to bring him to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And after digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.",
      "5": "And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,",
      "7": "“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”",
      "8": "And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?",
      "10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—",
      "11": "“I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”",
      "12": "And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
      "13": "And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them.",
      "14": "And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.",
      "15": "And it happened that he was dining in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.",
      "16": "And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
      "18": "And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”",
      "19": "And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.",
      "20": "But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.",
      "21": "No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse.",
      "22": "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.”",
      "23": "And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain.",
      "24": "And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”",
      "25": "And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—",
      "26": "how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it to those who were with him?”",
      "27": "And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there.",
      "2": "And they were watching him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him.",
      "3": "And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.”",
      "4": "And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.",
      "5": "And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.",
      "6": "And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians and began to conspire against him with regard to how they could destroy him.",
      "7": "And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee followed him. And from Judea",
      "8": "and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him because they heard all that he was doing.",
      "9": "And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him.",
      "10": "For he had healed many, so that all those who were suffering from diseases pressed about him in order that they could touch him.",
      "11": "And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known.",
      "13": "And he went up on the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him.",
      "14": "And he appointed twelve, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach",
      "15": "and to have authority to expel demons.",
      "16": "And he appointed the twelve. And to Simon he gave the name Peter,",
      "17": "and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”),",
      "18": "and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.",
      "20": "And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal.",
      "21": "And when his family heard this, they went out to restrain him, for they were saying, “He has lost his mind!”",
      "22": "And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!”",
      "23": "And he called them to himself and was speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan expel Satan?",
      "24": "And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.",
      "25": "And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.",
      "26": "And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end!",
      "27": "But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong man and plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he can thoroughly plunder his house.",
      "28": "“Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme.",
      "29": "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—",
      "30": "because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent word to him to summon him.",
      "32": "And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”",
      "33": "And he answered them and said, “Who is my mother or my brothers?”",
      "34": "And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!",
      "35": "For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.”"

      "1": "And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land.",
      "2": "And he began to teach them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,",
      "3": "“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.",
      "4": "And it happened that while he was sowing, some seed fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
      "5": "And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil.",
      "6": "And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered.",
      "7": "And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.",
      "8": "And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.",
      "9": "And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
      "10": "And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables.",
      "11": "And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,",
      "12": "so that\n‘they may look closely and not perceive,\n    and they may listen carefully and not understand,\nlest they turn and it be forgiven them.’”",

      "15": "And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
      "16": "And these are like the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.",
      "17": "And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.",
      "18": "And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word,",
      "19": "and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive.",
      "20": "And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.”",
      "21": "And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not so that it may be put on a lampstand?",
      "22": "For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light.",
      "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
      "24": "And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.",
      "25": "For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”",
      "26": "And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground.",
      "27": "And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—he does not know how.",
      "28": "By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head.",
      "29": "But when the crop permits, he sends in the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.”",
      "30": "And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?",
      "31": "It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although it is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground,",
      "32": "but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.”",
      "33": "And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.",
      "34": "And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples.",
      "35": "And on that day, when it was evening, he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”",
      "36": "And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.",
      "37": "And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled with water.",
      "38": "And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?”",
      "39": "And he woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Be silent!” And the wind abated and there was a great calm.",
      "40": "And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?”",

      "3": "who lived among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,",
      "4": "because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong enough to subdue him.",
      "5": "And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.",
      "6": "And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.",
      "7": "And crying out with a loud voice he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!”",

      "15": "And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid.",
      "16": "And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs.",

      "21": "And after Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.",
      "22": "And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he saw him, he fell down at his feet.",
