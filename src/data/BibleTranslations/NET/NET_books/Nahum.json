      "12": "This is what the Lord says:\n“Even though they are powerful—\nand what is more, even though their army is numerous—\nnevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!\nAlthough I afflicted you,\nI will afflict you no more.",
      "13": "And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;\nI will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”",
      "14": "The Lord has issued a decree against you:\n“Your dynasty will come to an end.\nI will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.\nI will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!”",
      "15": "(2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains!\nA messenger is proclaiming deliverance:\n“Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!\nFulfill your sacred vows to praise God!\nFor never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you;\nthey have been completely destroyed.”"

      "11": "Where now is the den of the lions\nand the feeding place of the young lions,\nwhere the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled\nand no one disturbed them?",
      "12": "The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs needed\nand strangled prey for his lionesses;\nhe filled his lairs with prey\nand his dens with torn flesh.",
      "13": "“I am against you!” declares the Lord of Heaven’s Armies:\n“I will burn your chariots with fire;\nthe sword will devour your young lions.\nYou will no longer prey upon the land;\nthe voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”"

      "8": "You are no more secure than Thebes—\nshe was located on the banks of the Nile;\nthe waters surrounded her—\nher rampart was the sea,\nthe water was her wall.",
      "9": "Cush and Egypt had limitless strength;\nPut and the Libyans were among her allies.",
      "10": "Yet she went into captivity as an exile;\neven her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.\nThey cast lots for her nobility;\nall her dignitaries were bound with chains.",
      "11": "You too will act like drunkards;\nyou will go into hiding;\nyou too will seek refuge from the enemy.",
