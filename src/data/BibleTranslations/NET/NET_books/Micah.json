      "1": "This is the Lord’s message that came to Micah of Moresheth during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Listen, all you nations!\nPay attention, all inhabitants of earth!\nThe Sovereign Lord will act as a witness against you;\nthe Lord will accuse you from his majestic palace.",
      "3": "Look, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling place!\nHe will descend and march on the earth’s mountaintops!",
      "4": "The mountains will crumble beneath him,\nand the valleys will split apart\nlike wax before a fire,\nlike water dumped down a steep slope.",
      "5": "All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion\nand the sins of the nation of Israel.\nAnd just what is Jacob’s rebellion?\nIsn’t it Samaria’s doings?\nAnd what is Judah’s sin?\nIsn’t it Jerusalem’s doings?",
      "6": "“I will turn Samaria into a heap of ruins in an open field,\ninto a place for planting vineyards.\nI will dump the rubble of her walls down into the valley\nand lay bare her foundations.",
      "7": "All her carved idols will be smashed to pieces;\nall her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire.\nI will make a waste heap of all her images.\nSince she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages,\nthe idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”",
      "8": "For this reason I will mourn and wail;\nI will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments.\nI will howl like a wild dog,\nand screech like an owl.",
      "9": "For Samaria’s disease is incurable.\nIt has infected Judah;\nit has spread to the leadership of my people\nand even to Jerusalem!",
      "10": "Don’t spread the news in Gath.\nDon’t shed even a single tear.\nIn Beth Leaphrah roll about in mourning in the dust!",
      "11": "Residents of Shaphir, pass by in nakedness and humiliation!\nThe residents of Zaanan have not escaped.\nBeth Ezel mourns,\n“He takes from you what he desires.”",
      "12": "Indeed, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen,\nthough the Lord has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Residents of Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots!\nYou influenced Daughter Zion to sin,\nfor Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back to you!",
      "14": "Therefore you will have to say farewell to Moresheth Gath.\nThe residents of Achzib will be as disappointing\nas a dried up well to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "Residents of Mareshah, a conqueror will attack you;\nthe leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love;\nshave your foreheads as bald as an eagle,\nfor they are taken from you into exile."
    },

      "1": "Beware wicked schemers,\nthose who devise calamity as they lie in bed.\nAs soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans,\nbecause they have the power to do so.",
      "2": "They confiscate the fields they desire\nand seize the houses they want.\nThey defraud people of their homes\nand deprive people of the land they have inherited.",
      "3": "Therefore the Lord says this:\n“Look, I am devising disaster for this nation!\nIt will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck.\nYou will no longer walk proudly,\nfor it will be a time of catastrophe.",
      "4": "In that day people will sing this taunt song to you—\nthey will mock you with this lament:\n‘We are completely destroyed;\nthey sell off the property of my people.\nHow they remove it from me!\nThey assign our fields to the conqueror.’”",
      "5": "Therefore no one will assign you land in the Lord’s community.",
      "6": "“Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,” they say excitedly.\n“These prophets should not preach of such things;\nwe will not be overtaken by humiliation.”",
      "7": "Does the family of Jacob say,\n“The Lord’s patience can’t be exhausted—\nhe would never do such things”?\nTo be sure, my commands bring a reward\nfor those who obey them,",
      "8": "but you rise up as an enemy against my people.\nYou steal a robe from a friend,\nfrom those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.",
      "9": "You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes.\nYou defraud their children of their prized inheritance.",
      "10": "But you are the ones who will be forced to leave!\nFor this land is not secure;\nsin will thoroughly destroy it!",
      "11": "If a lying windbag should come and say,\n‘I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’\nhe would be just the right preacher for these people!",
      "12": "“I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,\nI will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain.\nI will bring them together like sheep in a fold,\nlike a flock in the middle of a pasture;\nthey will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.",
      "13": "The one who can break through barriers will lead them out;\nthey will break out, pass through the gate, and leave.\nTheir king will advance before them;\nthe Lord himself will lead them.”"

    "3": {
      "1": "I said,\n“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,\nyou rulers of the nation of Israel!\nYou ought to know what is just,",
      "2": "yet you hate what is good\nand love what is evil.\nYou flay my people’s skin\nand rip the flesh from their bones.",
      "3": "You devour my people’s flesh,\nstrip off their skin,\nand crush their bones.\nYou chop them up like flesh in a pot—\nlike meat in a kettle.",
      "4": "Someday these sinful leaders will cry to the Lord for help,\nbut he will not answer them.\nHe will hide his face from them at that time,\nbecause they have done such wicked deeds.”",
      "5": "This is what the Lord has said about the prophets who mislead my people,\n“If someone gives them enough to eat,\nthey offer an oracle of peace.\nBut if someone does not give them food,\nthey are ready to declare war on him.",
      "6": "Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions;\nit will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens.\nThe sun will set on these prophets,\nand the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.",
      "7": "The prophets will be ashamed;\nthe omen readers will be humiliated.\nAll of them will cover their mouths,\nfor they will receive no divine oracles.”",
      "8": "But I am full of the courage that the Lord’s Spirit gives\nand have a strong commitment to justice.\nThis enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion\nand Israel with its sin.",
      "9": "Listen to this, you leaders of the family of Jacob,\nyou rulers of the nation of Israel!\nYou hate justice\nand pervert all that is right.",
      "10": "You build Zion through bloody crimes,\nJerusalem through unjust violence.",
      "11": "Her leaders take bribes when they decide legal cases,\nher priests proclaim rulings for profit,\nand her prophets read omens for pay.\nYet they claim to trust the Lord and say,\n“The Lord is among us.\nDisaster will not overtake us!”",
      "12": "Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,\nJerusalem will become a heap of ruins,\nand the Temple Mount will become a hill overgrown with brush!"

    "4": {
      "1": "And in future days the Lord’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all;\nit will be more prominent than other hills.\nPeople will stream to it.",
      "2": "Many nations will come, saying,\n“Come on! Let’s go up to the Lord’s mountain,\nto the temple of Jacob’s God,\nso he can teach us his ways\nand we can live by his laws.”\nFor instruction will proceed from Zion,\nthe Lord’s message from Jerusalem.",
      "3": "He will arbitrate between many peoples\nand settle disputes between many distant nations.\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares,\nand their spears into pruning hooks.\nNations will not use weapons against other nations,\nand they will no longer train for war.",
      "4": "Each will sit under his own grapevine\nor under his own fig tree without any fear.\nThe Lord of Heaven’s Armies has decreed it.",
      "5": "Though all the nations follow their respective gods,\nwe will follow the Lord our God forever.",
      "6": "“In that day,” says the Lord, “I will gather the lame\nand assemble the outcasts whom I injured.",
      "7": "I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation,\nand those far off into a mighty nation.\nThe Lord will reign over them on Mount Zion,\nfrom that day forward and forevermore.",
      "8": "As for you, watchtower for the flock,\nfortress of Daughter Zion—\nyour former dominion will be restored,\nthe sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.”",
      "9": "Jerusalem, why are you now shouting so loudly?\nHas your king disappeared?\nHas your wise leader been destroyed?\nIs this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor?",
      "10": "Twist and strain, Daughter Zion, as if you were in labor!\nFor you will leave the city\nand live in the open field.\nYou will go to Babylon,\nbut there you will be rescued.\nThere the Lord will deliver you\nfrom the power of your enemies.",
      "11": "Many nations have now assembled against you.\nThey say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated,\nso we can gloat over Zion!”",
      "12": "But they do not know what the Lord is planning;\nthey do not understand his strategy.\nHe has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed at the threshing floor.",
      "13": "“Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!\nFor I will give you iron horns;\nI will give you bronze hooves,\nand you will crush many nations.”\nYou will devote to the Lord the spoils you take from them\nand dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler of the whole earth."

      "3": "So the Lord will hand the people of Israel over to their enemies\nuntil the time when the woman in labor gives birth.\nThen the rest of the king’s countrymen will return\nto be reunited with the people of Israel.",
      "4": "He will assume his post and shepherd the people by the Lord’s strength,\nby the sovereign authority of the Lord his God.\nThey will live securely, for at that time he will be honored\neven in the distant regions of the earth.",
