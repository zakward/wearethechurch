  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.",
      "4": "Now his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s customary practice.",
      "6": "Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord—and Satan also arrived among them.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” And Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”",
      "8": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God?",
      "10": "Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.",
      "11": "But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”",
      "12": "So the Lord said to Satan, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "Now the day came when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "14": "and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them,",
      "15": "and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "16": "While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants—it has consumed them! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "17": "While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "18": "While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "19": "and suddenly a great wind swept across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "20": "Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he threw himself down with his face to the ground.",
      "21": "He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. May the name of the Lord be blessed!”",
      "22": "In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also arrived among them to present himself before the Lord.",
      "2": "And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”",
      "3": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds firmly to his integrity, so that you stirred me up to destroy him without reason.”",
      "4": "But Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give up all that he has to save his life.",
      "5": "But extend your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”",
      "6": "So the Lord said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power; only preserve his life.”",
      "7": "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and he afflicted Job with a malignant ulcer from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.",
      "8": "Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape himself with while he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God, and die!”",
      "10": "But he replied, “You’re talking like one of the godless women would do! Should we receive what is good from God, and not also receive what is evil?” In all this Job did not sin by what he said.",
      "11": "When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to show sympathy for him and to console him.",
      "12": "But when they gazed intently from a distance but did not recognize him, they began to weep loudly. Each of them tore his robes, and they threw dust into the air over their heads.",
      "13": "Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.",
      "2": "Job spoke up and said:",
      "3": "“Let the day on which I was born perish,\nand the night that said,\n‘A man has been conceived!’",
      "4": "That day—let it be darkness;\nlet not God on high regard it,\nnor let light shine on it!",
      "5": "Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it;\nlet a cloud settle on it;\nlet whatever blackens the day terrify it.",
      "6": "That night—let darkness seize it;\nlet it not be included among the days of the year;\nlet it not enter among the number of the months!",
      "7": "Indeed, let that night be barren;\nlet no shout of joy penetrate it!",
      "8": "Let those who curse the day curse it—\nthose who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.",
      "9": "Let its morning stars be darkened;\nlet it wait for daylight but find none,\nnor let it see the first rays of dawn,",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me,\nnor did it hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "“Why did I not die at birth,\nand why did I not expire\nas I came out of the womb?",
      "12": "Why did the knees welcome me,\nand why were there two breasts\nthat I might nurse at them?",
      "13": "For now I would be lying down\nand would be quiet,\nI would be asleep and then at peace",
      "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth\nwho built for themselves places now desolate,",
      "15": "or with princes who possessed gold,\nwho filled their palaces with silver.",
      "16": "Or why was I not buried\nlike a stillborn infant,\nlike infants who have never seen the light?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil,\nand there the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "There the prisoners relax together;\nthey do not hear the voice of the oppressor.",
      "19": "Small and great are there,\nand the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "“Why does God give light to one who is in misery,\nand life to those whose soul is bitter,",
      "21": "to those who wait for death that does not come,\nand search for it\nmore than for hidden treasures,",
      "22": "who rejoice even to jubilation,\nand are exultant when they find the grave?",
      "23": "Why is light given to a man\nwhose way is hidden,\nand whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "For my sighing comes in place of my food,\nand my groanings flow forth like water.",
      "25": "For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me,\nand what I feared has come upon me.",
      "26": "I have no ease, I have no quietness;\nI cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
      "2": "“If someone should attempt a word with you,\nwill you be impatient?\nBut who can refrain from speaking?",
      "3": "Look, you have instructed many;\nyou have strengthened feeble hands.",
      "4": "Your words have supported those\nwho stumbled,\nand you have strengthened the knees\nthat gave way.",
      "5": "But now the same thing comes to you,\nand you are discouraged;\nit strikes you,\nand you are terrified.",
      "6": "Is not your piety your confidence,\nand your blameless ways your hope?",
      "7": "Call to mind now:\nWho, being innocent, ever perished?\nAnd where were upright people ever destroyed?",
      "8": "Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity\nand those who sow trouble reap the same.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish,\nand by the blast of his anger they are consumed.",
      "10": "There is the roaring of the lion\nand the growling of the young lion,\nbut the teeth of the young lions are broken.",
      "11": "The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey,\nand the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "“Now a word was stealthily brought to me,\nand my ear caught a whisper of it.",
      "13": "In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night\nwhen a deep sleep falls on men,",
      "14": "dread gripped me and trembling,\nwhich made all my bones shake.",
      "15": "Then a breath of air passes by my face;\nit makes the hair of my flesh stand up.",
      "16": "It stands still,\nbut I cannot recognize its appearance;\nan image is before my eyes,\nand I hear a murmuring voice:",
      "17": "‘Is a mortal man righteous before God?\nOr a man pure before his Creator?",
      "18": "If God puts no trust in his servants\nand attributes folly to his angels,",
      "19": "how much more to those who live in houses of clay,\nwhose foundation is in the dust,\nwho are crushed like a moth?",
      "20": "They are destroyed between morning and evening;\nthey perish forever without anyone regarding it.",

    },
    "5": {
      "1": "“Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you?\nTo which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "For wrath kills the foolish person,\nand anger slays the silly one.",
      "3": "I myself have seen the fool taking root,\nbut suddenly I cursed his place of residence.",
      "4": "His children are far from safety,\nand they are crushed at the place where judgment is rendered,\nnor is there anyone to deliver them.",
      "5": "The hungry eat up his harvest,\nand take it even from behind the thorns,\nand the thirsty pant for their wealth.",
      "6": "For evil does not come up from the dust,\nnor does trouble spring up from the ground,",
      "7": "but people are born to trouble,\nas surely as the sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "“But as for me, I would seek God,\nand to God I would set forth my case.",

      "13": "He catches the wise in their own craftiness,\nand the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end.",
      "14": "They meet with darkness in the daytime,\nand grope about in the noontime as if it were night.",
      "15": "So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth,\neven the poor from the hand of the powerful.",
      "16": "Thus the poor have hope,\nand iniquity shuts its mouth.",
      "17": "“Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects,\nso do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.",
      "18": "For he wounds, but he also bandages;\nhe strikes, but his hands also heal.",
      "19": "He will deliver you from six calamities;\nyes, in seven no evil will touch you.",
      "20": "In time of famine he will redeem you from death,\nand in time of war from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "You will be protected from malicious gossip,\nand will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes.",
      "22": "You will laugh at destruction and famine\nand need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.",
      "23": "For you will have a pact with the stones of the field,\nand the wild animals will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "And you will know that your home will be secure,\nand when you inspect your domains,\nyou will not be missing anything.",
