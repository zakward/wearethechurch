      "3": "What benefit do people get from all the effort\nwhich they expend on earth?",
      "4": "A generation comes and a generation goes,\nbut the earth remains the same through the ages.",
      "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets;\nit hurries away to a place from which it rises again.",
      "6": "The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north;\nround and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.",
      "7": "All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,\nand to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.",
      "8": "All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it.\nThe eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.",
      "9": "What exists now is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing truly new on earth.",
      "10": "Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new”?\nIt was already done long ago, before our time.",
      "11": "No one remembers the former events,\nnor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;\nthey will not be remembered by the future generations.",
      "12": "I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine\nall that has been accomplished on earth.\nI concluded: God has given people a burdensome task\nthat keeps them occupied.",
      "14": "I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,\nand I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile—like chasing the wind!",
      "15": "What is bent cannot be straightened,\nand what is missing cannot be supplied.",
      "16": "I thought to myself,\n“I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;\nI have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;\nhowever, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind.",
      "18": "For with great wisdom comes great frustration;\nwhoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache."

      "1": "I thought to myself,\n“Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”\nBut I found that it also is futile.",
      "2": "I said of partying, “It is folly,”\nand of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”",
      "3": "I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine\n(all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom)\nand the effects of behaving foolishly,\nso that I might discover what is profitable\nfor people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.",
      "4": "I increased my possessions:\nI built houses for myself;\nI planted vineyards for myself.",
      "5": "I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,\nand I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.",
      "6": "I constructed pools of water for myself,\nto irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.",
      "7": "I purchased male and female slaves,\nand I owned slaves who were born in my house;\nI also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—\nthan any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "I also amassed silver and gold for myself,\nas well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.\nI acquired male singers and female singers for myself,\nand what gives a man sensual delight—a harem of beautiful concubines.",
      "9": "So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,\nyet I maintained my objectivity.",
      "10": "I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted;\nI did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.\nSo all my accomplishments gave me joy;\nthis was my reward for all my effort.",
      "11": "Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished\nand on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,\nI concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless—\nlike chasing the wind!\nThere is nothing gained from them on earth.”",
      "12": "Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.\nFor what more can the king’s successor do than what the king has already done?",
      "13": "I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,\njust as light is preferable to darkness:",
      "14": "The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.\nYet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.",
      "15": "So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!\nThen what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”\nSo I lamented to myself,\n“The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”",
      "16": "For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,\nbecause in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.\nAlas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!",
      "17": "So I loathed life because what\nhappens on earth seems awful to me;\nfor all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.",
      "18": "So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,\nfor which I worked so hard on earth,\nbecause I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.",
      "19": "Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?\nYet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor\nfor which I worked so wisely on earth.\nThis also is futile!",
      "20": "So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor\nfor which I worked so hard on earth.",
      "21": "For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;\nhowever, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance\nto someone else who did not work for it.\nThis also is futile, and an awful injustice!",
      "22": "What does a man acquire from all his labor\nand from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?",
      "23": "For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,\nand even at night his mind cannot relax.\nThis also is futile!",
      "24": "There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,\nand to find enjoyment in their work.\nI also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.",
      "25": "For no one can eat and drink\nor experience joy apart from him.",
      "26": "For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,\nbut to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth—\nonly to give it to the one who pleases God.\nThis task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!"

      "18": "I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,\nso God can clearly show them that they are like animals.",
      "19": "For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:\nAs one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.\nThere is no advantage for humans over animals,\nfor both are fleeting.",
      "20": "Both go to the same place,\nboth come from the dust,\nand to dust both return.",
      "21": "Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,\nand the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?”",
      "22": "So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,\nbecause that is their reward;\nfor who can show them what the future holds?"

      "3": "But better than both is the one who has not been born\nand has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.",
      "4": "Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:\nSurely it is nothing more than competition between one person and another.\nThis also is profitless—like chasing the wind.",

      "9": "Two people are better than one,\nbecause they can reap more benefit from their labor.",
      "10": "For if they fall, one will help his companion up,\nbut pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.",
      "11": "Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm,\nbut how can one person keep warm by himself?",
      "12": "Although an assailant may overpower one person,\ntwo can withstand him.\nMoreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.",
      "13": "A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king\nwho no longer knows how to receive advice.",
