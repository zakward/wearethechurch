      "1": "The following is a record of what Jeremiah son of Hilkiah prophesied. He was one of the priests who lived at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.",
      "2": "The Lord’s message came to him in the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon ruled over Judah.",
      "3": "It also came in the days of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile in the fifth month of that year.",
      "4": "The Lord’s message came to me,",
      "5": "“Before I formed you in your mother’s womb I chose you.\nBefore you were born I set you apart.\nI appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.”",
      "6": "I answered, “Oh, Sovereign Lord, Really I do not know how to speak well enough for that, for I am too young.”",
      "7": "The Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ But go to whomever I send you and say whatever I tell you.",
      "8": "Do not be afraid of those to whom I send you, for I will be with you to protect you,” says the Lord.",
      "9": "Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I will most assuredly give you the words you are to speak for me.",
      "10": "Know for certain that I hereby give you the authority to announce to nations and kingdoms that they will be uprooted and torn down, destroyed and demolished, rebuilt and firmly planted.”",
      "11": "Later the Lord’s message came to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”",
      "12": "Then the Lord said, “You have observed correctly. This means I am watching to make sure my threats are carried out.”",
      "13": "The Lord’s message came to me a second time, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a pot of boiling water; it is tipped away from the north.”",
      "14": "Then the Lord said, “From the north destruction will break out on all who live in the land.",
      "15": "For I will soon summon all the peoples of the kingdoms of the north,” says the Lord. “They will come and their kings will set up their thrones near the entrances of the gates of Jerusalem. They will attack all the walls surrounding it and all the towns in Judah.",
      "16": "In this way I will pass sentence on the people of Jerusalem and Judah because of all their wickedness. For they rejected me and offered sacrifices to other gods, worshiping what they made with their own hands.",
      "17": "“But you, Jeremiah, get yourself ready! Go and tell these people everything I instruct you to say. Do not be terrified of them, or I will give you good reason to be terrified of them.",
      "18": "I, the Lord, hereby promise to make you as strong as a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. You will be able to stand up against all who live in the land, including the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and all the people of the land.",

I remember how you loved me like a new bride; you followed me through the wilderness, through a land that had never been planted.",
      "3": "Israel was set apart to the Lord; they were like the firstfruits of a harvest to him. All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them,” says the Lord.’”",
      "4": "Now listen to the Lord’s message, you descendants of Jacob,\nall you family groups from the nation of Israel.",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says:\n“What fault could your ancestors have possibly found in me\nthat they strayed so far from me?\nThey paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.",
      "6": "They did not ask,\n‘Where is the Lord who delivered us out of Egypt,\nwho brought us through the wilderness,\nthrough a land of valleys and gorges,\nthrough a land of desert and deep darkness,\nthrough a land in which no one travels,\nand where no one lives?’",
      "7": "I brought you into a fertile land\nso you could enjoy its fruits and its rich bounty.\nBut when you entered my land, you defiled it;\nyou made the land I call my own loathsome to me.",
      "8": "Your priests did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord?’\nThose responsible for teaching my law did not really know me.\nYour rulers rebelled against me.\nYour prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal.\nThey all worshiped idols that could not help them.",
      "9": "“So, once more I will state my case against you,” says the Lord.\n“I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.",
      "10": "Go west across the sea to the coasts of Cyprus and see.\nSend someone east to Kedar and have them look carefully.\nSee if such a thing as this has ever happened:",

      "14": "“Israel is not a slave, is he?\nHe was not born into slavery, was he?\nIf not, why then is he being carried off?",
      "15": "Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;\nthey raise their voices in triumph.\nThey have laid his land waste;\nhis cities have been burned down and deserted.",
      "16": "Even the soldiers from Memphis and Tahpanhes\nhave cracked your skulls, people of Israel.",
      "17": "You have brought all this on yourself, Israel,\nby deserting the Lord your God when he was leading you along the right path.",
      "18": "What good will it do you then to go down to Egypt\nto seek help from the Egyptians?\nWhat good will it do you to go over to Assyria\nto seek help from the Assyrians?",
      "19": "Your own wickedness will bring about your punishment.\nYour unfaithful acts will bring down discipline on you.\nKnow, then, and realize how utterly harmful\nit was for you to reject me, the Lord your God,\nto show no respect for me,”\nsays the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies.",
      "20": "“Indeed, long ago you threw off my authority\nand refused to be subject to me.\nYou said, ‘I will not serve you.’\nInstead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill\nand under every green tree,\nlike a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.",
      "21": "I planted you in the land\nlike a special vine of the very best stock.\nWhy in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine\nthat produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?",
      "22": "You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.\nYou can use as much soap as you want.\nBut the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,”\nsays the Sovereign Lord.",
      "23": "“How can you say, ‘I have not made myself unclean.\nI have not paid allegiance to the gods called Baal.’\nJust look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom!\nThink about the things you have done there!\nYou are like a flighty, young female camel\nthat rushes here and there, crisscrossing its path.",
      "24": "You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.\nIn her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male.\nNo one can hold her back when she is in heat.\nNone of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.\nAt mating time she is easy to find.",
      "25": "Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out\nand your throats become dry.\nBut you say, ‘It is useless for you to try and stop me\nbecause I love those foreign gods and want to pursue them!’",
      "26": "Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught,\nso the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done.\nSo will their kings and officials,\ntheir priests and their prophets.",
      "27": "They say to a wooden idol, ‘You are my father.’\nThey say to a stone image, ‘You gave birth to me.’\nYes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me.\nYet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’",
      "28": "But where are the gods you made for yourselves?\nLet them save you when you are in trouble.\nThe sad fact is that you have as many gods\nas you have towns, Judah.",
      "29": "Why do you try to refute me?\nAll of you have rebelled against me,”\nsays the Lord.",
      "30": "“It did no good for me to punish your people.\nThey did not respond to such correction.\nYou slaughtered your prophets\nlike a voracious lion.",
      "31": "You people of this generation,\nlisten to the Lord’s message:\n“Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?\nHave I been like a dark and dangerous land to you?\nWhy then do you say, ‘We are free to wander.\nWe will not come to you anymore?’",
      "32": "Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?\nDoes a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?\nBut my people have forgotten me\nfor more days than can even be counted.",
      "33": "“My, how good you have become\nat chasing after your lovers!\nWhy, you could even teach prostitutes a thing or two!",
      "34": "Even your clothes are stained with\nthe lifeblood of the poor who had not done anything wrong;\nyou did not catch them breaking into your homes.\nYet, in spite of all these things you have done,",
      "35": "you say, ‘I have not done anything wrong,\nso the Lord cannot really be angry with me any more.’\nBut, watch out! I will bring down judgment on you\nbecause you say, ‘I have not committed any sin.’",
      "36": "Why do you constantly go about\nchanging your political allegiances?\nYou will get no help from Egypt\njust as you got no help from Assyria.",
      "37": "Moreover, you will come away from Egypt\nwith your hands covering your faces in sorrow and shame\nbecause the Lord will not allow your reliance on them to be successful\nand you will not gain any help from them."

      "2": "“Look up at the hilltops and consider this.\nWhere have you not been ravished?\nYou waited for those gods like a thief lying in wait in the wilderness.\nYou defiled the land by your wicked prostitution to other gods.",
      "3": "That is why the rains have been withheld\nand the spring rains have not come.\nYet in spite of this you are obstinate as a prostitute.\nYou refuse to be ashamed of what you have done.",

      "5": "You will not always be angry with me, will you?\nYou will not be mad at me forever, will you?’\nThat is what you say,\nbut you continually do all the evil that you can.”",
      "6": "When Josiah was king of Judah, the Lord said to me, “Jeremiah, you have no doubt seen what wayward Israel has done. You have seen how she went up to every high hill and under every green tree to give herself like a prostitute to other gods.",
      "7": "Yet even after she had done all that, I thought that she might come back to me. But she did not. Her sister, unfaithful Judah, saw what she did.",
      "8": "She also saw that, because of wayward Israel’s adulterous worship of other gods, I sent her away and gave her divorce papers. But still her unfaithful sister Judah was not afraid, and she too went and gave herself like a prostitute to other gods.",
      "9": "Because she took her prostitution so lightly, she defiled the land through her adulterous worship of gods made of wood and stone.",

      "13": "However, you must confess that you have done wrong\nand that you have rebelled against the Lord your God.\nYou must confess that you have given yourself to foreign gods under every green tree\nand have not obeyed my commands,’ says the Lord.",
      "14": "“Come back to me, my wayward sons,” says the Lord, “for I am your true master. If you do, I will take one of you from each town and two of you from each family group, and I will bring you back to Zion.",
      "15": "I will give you leaders who will be faithful to me. They will lead you with knowledge and insight.",
      "16": "In those days, your population will greatly increase in the land. At that time,” says the Lord, “people will no longer talk about having the ark that contains the Lord’s covenant with us. They will not call it to mind, remember it, or miss it. No, that will not be done anymore!",
      "17": "At that time the city of Jerusalem will be called the Lord’s throne. All nations will gather there in Jerusalem to honor the Lord’s name. They will no longer follow the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts.",
      "18": "At that time the nation of Judah and the nation of Israel will be reunited. Together they will come back from a land in the north to the land that I gave to your ancestors as a permanent possession.",
