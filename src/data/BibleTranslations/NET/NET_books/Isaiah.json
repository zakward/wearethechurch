      "2": "Listen, O heavens,\npay attention, O earth!\nFor the Lord speaks:\n“I raised children, I brought them up,\nbut they have rebelled against me!",
      "3": "An ox recognizes its owner,\na donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food;\nbut Israel does not recognize me,\nmy people do not understand.”",
      "4": "Beware sinful nation,\nthe people weighed down by evil deeds.\nThey are offspring who do wrong,\nchildren who do wicked things.\nThey have abandoned the Lord,\nand rejected the Holy One of Israel.\nThey are alienated from him.",

      "14": "I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;\nthey are a burden\nthat I am tired of carrying.",
      "15": "When you spread out your hands in prayer,\nI look the other way;\nwhen you offer your many prayers,\nI do not listen,\nbecause your hands are covered with blood.",
