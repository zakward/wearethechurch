      "21": "far above every rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.",

      "14": "For he is our peace, the one who made both groups into one and who destroyed the middle wall of partition, the hostility,",
      "15": "when he nullified in his flesh the law of commandments in decrees. He did this to create in himself one new man out of two, thus making peace,",
