    "1": {
      "1": "Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative), set apart for [preaching] the gospel of God [the good news of salvation],",
      "2": "which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures—",
      "3": "[the good news] regarding His Son, who, as to the flesh [His human nature], was born a descendant of David [to fulfill the covenant promises],",
      "4": "and [as to His divine nature] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated to be the Son of God with power [in a triumphant and miraculous way] by His resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "5": "It is through Him that we have received grace and [our] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name’s sake among all the Gentiles,",
      "6": "and you also are among those who are called of Jesus Christ to belong to Him;",
      "7": "[I am writing] to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called to be saints (God’s people) and set apart for a sanctified life, [that is, set apart for God and His purpose]: Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith [your trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness] is being proclaimed in all the world.",
      "9": "For God, whom I serve with my spirit by preaching the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how continuously I mention you",
      "10": "in my prayers; always pleading that somehow, by God’s will, I may now at last come to you.",
      "11": "For I long to see you so that I may share with you some spiritual gift, to strengthen and establish you;",
      "12": "that is, that we may be mutually encouraged and comforted by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.",
      "13": "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that many times I have planned to come to you, (and have been prevented so far) so that I may have some fruit [of my labors] among you, even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.",
      "14": "I have a duty to perform and a debt to pay both to Greeks and to barbarians [the cultured and the uncultured], both to the wise and to the foolish.",
      "15": "So, for my part, I am ready and eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.",
      "16": "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation [from His wrath and punishment] to everyone who believes [in Christ as Savior], to the Jew first and also to the Greek.",
      "17": "For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed in a way that awakens more faith]. As it is written and forever remains written, “The just and upright shall live by faith.”",
      "18": "For [God does not overlook sin and] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who in their wickedness suppress and stifle the truth,",
      "19": "because that which is known about God is evident within them [in their inner consciousness], for God made it evident to them.",
      "20": "For ever since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through His workmanship [all His creation, the wonderful things that He has made], so that they [who fail to believe and trust in Him] are without excuse and without defense.",
      "21": "For even though they knew God [as the Creator], they did not honor Him as God or give thanks [for His wondrous creation]. On the contrary, they became worthless in their thinking [godless, with pointless reasonings, and silly speculations], and their foolish heart was darkened.",
      "22": "Claiming to be wise, they became fools,",
      "23": "and exchanged the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God for an image [worthless idols] in the shape of mortal man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.",
      "24": "Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their own hearts to [sexual] impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin],",
      "25": "because [by choice] they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.",
      "26": "For this reason God gave them over to degrading and vile passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural [a function contrary to nature],",
      "27": "and in the same way also the men turned away from the natural function of the woman and were consumed with their desire toward one another, men with men committing shameful acts and in return receiving in their own bodies the inevitable and appropriate penalty for their wrongdoing.",
      "28": "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or consider Him worth knowing [as their Creator], God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do things which are improper and repulsive,",
      "29": "until they were filled (permeated, saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice and mean-spiritedness. They are gossips [spreading rumors],",
      "30": "slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors [of new forms] of evil, disobedient and disrespectful to parents,",
      "31": "without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful [without pity].",
      "32": "Although they know God’s righteous decree and His judgment, that those who do such things deserve death, yet they not only do them, but they even [enthusiastically] approve and tolerate others who practice them."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore you have no excuse or justification, everyone of you who [hypocritically] judges and condemns others; for in passing judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, because you who judge [from a position of arrogance or self-righteousness] are habitually practicing the very same things [which you denounce].",
      "2": "And we know that the judgment of God falls justly and in accordance with truth on those who practice such things.",
      "3": "But do you think this, O man, when you judge and condemn those who practice such things, and yet do the same yourself, that you will escape God’s judgment and elude His verdict?",
      "4": "Or do you have no regard for the wealth of His kindness and tolerance and patience [in withholding His wrath]? Are you [actually] unaware or ignorant [of the fact] that God’s kindness leads you to repentance [that is, to change your inner self, your old way of thinking—seek His purpose for your life]?",
      "5": "But because of your callous stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are [deliberately] storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.",
      "6": "He will pay back to each person according to his deeds [justly, as his deeds deserve]:",
      "7": "to those who by persistence in doing good seek [unseen but certain heavenly] glory, honor, and immortality, [He will give the gift of] eternal life.",
      "8": "But for those who are selfishly ambitious and self-seeking and disobedient to the truth but responsive to wickedness, [there will be] wrath and indignation.",
      "9": "There will be tribulation and anguish [torturing confinement] for every human soul who does [or permits] evil, to the Jew first and also to the Greek,",
      "10": "but glory and honor and inner peace [will be given] to everyone who habitually does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.",
      "11": "For God shows no partiality [no arbitrary favoritism; with Him one person is not more important than another].",
      "12": "For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law.",
      "13": "For it is not those who merely hear the Law [as it is read aloud] who are just or righteous before God, but it is those who [actually] obey the Law who will be justified [pronounced free of the guilt of sin and declared acceptable to Him].",
      "14": "When Gentiles, who do not have the Law [since it was given only to Jews], do instinctively the things the Law requires [guided only by their conscience], they are a law to themselves, though they do not have the Law.",
      "15": "They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts; and their conscience [their sense of right and wrong, their moral choices] bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or perhaps defending them",
      "16": "on that day when, as my gospel proclaims, God will judge the secrets [all the hidden thoughts and concealed sins] of men through Christ Jesus.",
      "17": "But if you bear the name “Jew” and rely on the Law [for your salvation] and boast in [your special relationship to] God,",
      "18": "and [if you claim to] know His will and approve the things that are essential or have a sense of what is excellent, based on your instruction from the Law,",
      "19": "and [if you] are confident that you are a [qualified] guide to the blind [those untaught in theology], a light to those who are in darkness,",
      "20": "and [that you are] a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the [spiritually] childish, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth—",
      "21": "well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal [in ways that are discrete, but just as sinful]?",
      "22": "You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob [pagan] temples [of valuable idols and offerings]?",
      "23": "You who boast in the Law, do you [repeatedly] dishonor God by breaking the Law?",
      "24": "For, “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it is written [in Scripture].",
      "25": "Circumcision [the sign of the covenant of Abraham] is indeed of value if you practice the Law; but if you habitually break the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision [it is meaningless in God’s sight].",
      "26": "So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded [by God] as circumcision?",
      "27": "Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps [the spirit of] the Law will judge you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, break the Law.",
      "28": "For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly, nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical.",
      "29": "But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and [true] circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by [the fulfillment of] the letter [of the Law]. His praise is not from men, but from God."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Then what is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?",
      "2": "Great in every respect. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [His very words].",
      "3": "What then? If some did not believe or were unfaithful [to God], their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word, will it?",
      "4": "Certainly not! Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person be found a liar, just as it is written [in Scripture],\n“That You may be justified in Your words,\nAnd prevail when You are judged [by sinful men].”",
      "5": "But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [on us], is He? (I am speaking in purely human terms.)",
      "6": "Certainly not! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?",
      "7": "But [as you might say] if through my lie God’s truth was magnified and abounded to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "And why not say, (as some slanderously report and claim that we teach) “Let us do evil so that good may come of it”? Their condemnation [by God] is just.",
      "9": "Well then, are we [Jews] better off than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under the control of sin and subject to its power.",
      "10": "As it is written and forever remains written,\n“There is none righteous [none that meets God’s standard], not even one.",
      "11": "“There is none who understands,\nThere is none who seeks for God.",
      "12": "“All have turned aside, together they have become useless;\nThere is none who does good, no, not one.”",
      "13": "“Their throat is an open grave;\nThey [habitually] deceive with their tongues.”\n“The venom of asps is beneath their lips.”",
      "14": "“Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.”",
      "15": "“Their feet are swift to shed blood,",
      "16": "Destruction and misery are in their paths,",
      "17": "And they have not known the path of peace.”",
      "18": "“There is no fear of God [and His awesome power] before their eyes.”",
      "19": "Now we know that whatever the Law [of Moses] says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the excuses of] every mouth may be silenced [from protesting] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [and subject to His judgment].",
      "20": "For no person will be justified [freed of guilt and declared righteous] in His sight by [trying to do] the works of the Law. For through the Law we become conscious of sin [and the recognition of sin directs us toward repentance, but provides no remedy for sin].",
      "21": "But now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [independently and completely] apart from the Law, though it is [actually] confirmed by the Law and the [words and writings of the] Prophets.",
      "22": "This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [Jew or Gentile] who believe [and trust in Him and acknowledge Him as God’s Son]. There is no distinction,",
      "23": "since all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God,",
      "24": "and are being justified [declared free of the guilt of sin, made acceptable to God, and granted eternal life] as a gift by His [precious, undeserved] grace, through the redemption [the payment for our sin] which is [provided] in Christ Jesus,",
      "25": "whom God displayed publicly [before the eyes of the world] as a [life-giving] sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation (propitiation) by His blood [to be received] through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness [which demands punishment for sin], because in His forbearance [His deliberate restraint] He passed over the sins previously committed [before Jesus’ crucifixion].",
      "26": "It was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus [and rely confidently on Him as Savior].",
      "27": "Then what becomes of [our] boasting? It is excluded [entirely ruled out, banished]. On what principle? On [the principle of good] works? No, but on the principle of faith.",
      "28": "For we maintain that an individual is justified by faith distinctly apart from works of the Law [the observance of which has nothing to do with justification, that is, being declared free of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God].",
      "29": "Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not also the God of Gentiles [who were not given the Law]? Yes, of Gentiles also,",
      "30": "since indeed it is one [and the same] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [which began with Abraham] and the uncircumcised through [their newly acquired] faith.",
      "31": "Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [making the Law of no effect, overthrowing it]? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and uphold the Law [since it convicts us all of sin, pointing to the need for salvation]."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather humanly speaking, has found? [Has he obtained a favored standing?]",
      "2": "For if Abraham was justified [that is, acquitted from the guilt of his sins] by works [those things he did that were good], he has something to boast about, but not before God.",
      "3": "For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed in (trusted, relied on) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living, right standing with God).”",
      "4": "Now to a laborer, his wages are not credited as a favor or a gift, but as an obligation [something owed to him].",
      "5": "But to the one who does not work [that is, the one who does not try to earn his salvation by doing good], but believes and completely trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).",
      "6": "And in this same way David speaks of the blessing on the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:",
      "7": "“Blessed and happy and favored are those whose lawless acts have been forgiven,\nAnd whose sins have been covered up and completely buried.",
      "8": "“Blessed and happy and favored is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account nor charge against him.”",
      "9": "Is this blessing only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say, “Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.”",
      "10": "How then was it credited [to him]? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? Not after, but while [he was] uncircumcised.",
      "11": "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal or confirmation of the righteousness which he had by faith while [he was still] uncircumcised—this was so that he would be the [spiritual] father of all who believe without being circumcised—so that righteousness would be credited to them,",
      "12": "and [that he would be] the [spiritual] father of those circumcised who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had before he was circumcised.",
      "13": "For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through [observing the requirements of] the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.",
      "14": "If those who are [followers] of the Law are [the true] heirs [of Abraham], then faith [leading to salvation] is of no effect and void, and the promise [of God] is nullified.",
      "15": "For the Law results in [God’s] wrath [against sin], but where there is no law, there is no violation [of it either].",
      "16": "Therefore, [inheriting] the promise depends entirely on faith [that is, confident trust in the unseen God], in order that it may be given as an act of grace [His unmerited favor and mercy], so that the promise will be [legally] guaranteed to all the descendants [of Abraham]—not only for those [Jewish believers] who keep the Law, but also for those [Gentile believers] who share the faith of Abraham, who is the [spiritual] father of us all—",
      "17": "(as it is written [in Scripture], “I have made you a father of many nations”) in the sight of Him in whom he believed, that is, God who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.",
      "18": "In hope against hope Abraham believed that he would become a father of many nations, as he had been promised [by God]: “So [numberless] shall your descendants be.”",
      "19": "Without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body, now as good as dead [for producing children] since he was about a hundred years old, and [he considered] the deadness of Sarah’s womb.",
      "20": "But he did not doubt or waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong and empowered by faith, giving glory to God,",
      "21": "being fully convinced that God had the power to do what He had promised.",
      "22": "Therefore his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).",
      "23": "Now not for his sake alone was it written that it was credited to him,",
      "24": "but for our sake also—to whom righteousness will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead—",
      "25": "who was betrayed and crucified because of our sins, and was raised [from the dead] because of our justification [our acquittal—absolving us of all sin before God]."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Therefore, since we have been justified [that is, acquitted of sin, declared blameless before God] by faith, [let us grasp the fact that] we have peace with God [and the joy of reconciliation with Him] through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).",
      "2": "Through Him we also have access by faith into this [remarkable state of] grace in which we [firmly and safely and securely] stand. Let us rejoice in our hope and the confident assurance of [experiencing and enjoying] the glory of [our great] God [the manifestation of His excellence and power].",
      "3": "And not only this, but [with joy] let us exult in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships, knowing that hardship (distress, pressure, trouble) produces patient endurance;",
      "4": "and endurance, proven character (spiritual maturity); and proven character, hope and confident assurance [of eternal salvation].",
      "5": "Such hope [in God’s promises] never disappoints us, because God’s love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",
      "6": "While we were still helpless [powerless to provide for our salvation], at the right time Christ died [as a substitute] for the ungodly.",
      "7": "Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to willingly give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a good man [one who is noble and selfless and worthy] someone might even dare to die.",
      "8": "But God clearly shows and proves His own love for us, by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
      "9": "Therefore, since we have now been justified [declared free of the guilt of sin] by His blood, [how much more certain is it that] we will be saved from the wrath of God through Him.",
      "10": "For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, it is much more certain, having been reconciled, that we will be saved [from the consequences of sin] by His life [that is, we will be saved because Christ lives today].",
      "11": "Not only that, but we also rejoice in God [rejoicing in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received and enjoy our reconciliation [with God].",
      "12": "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people [no one being able to stop it or escape its power], because they all sinned.",
      "13": "Sin was [committed] in the world before the Law [was given], but sin is not charged [against anyone] when there is no law [against it].",
      "14": "Yet death ruled [over mankind] from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who had not sinned as Adam did. Adam is a type of Him (Christ) who was to come [but in reverse—Adam brought destruction, Christ brought salvation].",
      "15": "But the free gift [of God] is not like the trespass [because the gift of grace overwhelms the fall of man]. For if many died by one man’s trespass [Adam’s sin], much more [abundantly] did God’s grace and the gift [that comes] by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow to [benefit] the many.",
      "16": "Nor is the gift [of grace] like that which came through the one who sinned. For on the one hand the judgment [following the sin] resulted from one trespass and brought condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift resulted from many trespasses and brought justification [the release from sin’s penalty for those who believe].",
      "17": "For if by the trespass of the one (Adam), death reigned through the one (Adam), much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in [eternal] life through the One, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "So then as through one trespass [Adam’s sin] there resulted condemnation for all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.",
      "19": "For just as through one man’s disobedience [his failure to hear, his carelessness] the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of the one Man the many will be made righteous and acceptable to God and brought into right standing with Him.",
      "20": "But the Law came to increase and expand [the awareness of] the trespass [by defining and unmasking sin]. But where sin increased, [God’s remarkable, gracious gift of] grace [His unmerited favor] has surpassed it and increased all the more,",
      "21": "so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness which brings eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "What shall we say [to all this]? Should we continue in sin and practice sin as a habit so that [God’s gift of] grace may increase and overflow?",
      "2": "Certainly not! How can we, the very ones who died to sin, continue to live in it any longer?",
      "3": "Or are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?",
      "4": "We have therefore been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory and power of the Father, we too might walk habitually in newness of life [abandoning our old ways].",
      "5": "For if we have become one with Him [permanently united] in the likeness of His death, we will also certainly be [one with Him and share fully] in the likeness of His resurrection.",
      "6": "We know that our old self [our human nature without the Holy Spirit] was nailed to the cross with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.",
      "7": "For the person who has died [with Christ] has been freed from [the power of] sin.",
      "8": "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live [together] with Him,",
      "9": "because we know [the self-evident truth] that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him.",
      "10": "For the death that He died, He died to sin [ending its power and paying the sinner’s debt] once and for all; and the life that He lives, He lives to [glorify] God [in unbroken fellowship with Him].",
      "11": "Even so, consider yourselves to be dead to sin [and your relationship to it broken], but alive to God [in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus.",
      "12": "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and passions.",
      "13": "Do not go on offering members of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness. But offer yourselves to God [in a decisive act] as those alive [raised] from the dead [to a new life], and your members [all of your abilities—sanctified, set apart] as instruments of righteousness [yielded] to God.",
      "14": "For sin will no longer be a master over you, since you are not under Law [as slaves], but under [unmerited] grace [as recipients of God’s favor and mercy].",
      "15": "What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under [God’s] grace? Certainly not!",
      "16": "Do you not know that when you continually offer yourselves to someone to do his will, you are the slaves of the one whom you obey, either [slaves] of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness (right standing with God)?",
      "17": "But thank God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed.",
      "18": "And having been set free from sin, you have become the slaves of righteousness [of conformity to God’s will and purpose].",
      "19": "I am speaking in [familiar] human terms because of your natural limitations [your spiritual immaturity]. For just as you presented your bodily members as slaves to impurity and to [moral] lawlessness, leading to further lawlessness, so now offer your members [your abilities, your talents] as slaves to righteousness, leading to sanctification [that is, being set apart for God’s purpose].",
      "20": "When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness [you had no desire to conform to God’s will].",
      "21": "So what benefit did you get at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? [None!] For the outcome of those things is death!",
      "22": "But now since you have been set free from sin and have become [willing] slaves to God, you have your benefit, resulting in sanctification [being made holy and set apart for God’s purpose], and the outcome [of this] is eternal life.",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God [that is, His remarkable, overwhelming gift of grace to believers] is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."

      "5": "When we were living in the flesh [trapped by sin], the sinful passions, which were awakened by [that which] the Law [identifies as sin], were at work in our body to bear fruit for death [since the willingness to sin led to death and separation from God].",
