      "1": "Since [as is well known] many have undertaken to compile an orderly account of the things which have been fulfilled among us [by God],",
      "2": "exactly as they were handed down to us by those [with personal experience] who from the beginning [of Christ’s ministry] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word [that is, of the teaching concerning salvation through faith in Christ],",
      "3": "it seemed fitting for me as well, [and so I have decided] after having carefully searched out and investigated all the events accurately, from the very beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus;",
      "4": "so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught [that is, the history and doctrine of the faith].",
      "5": "In the days of Herod [the Great], king of Judea, there was a certain priest whose name was Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron [the first high priest of Israel], and her name was Elizabeth.",
      "6": "They both were righteous (approved) in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.",
      "7": "But they were childless, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both far advanced in years.",
      "8": "Now it happened while Zacharias was serving as priest before God in the appointed order of his priestly division,",
      "9": "as was the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter [the sanctuary of] the temple of the Lord and burn incense [on the altar of incense].",
      "10": "And all the congregation was praying outside [in the court of the temple] at the hour of the incense offering.",
      "11": "And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.",
      "12": "When Zacharias saw the angel, he was troubled and overcome with fear.",
      "13": "But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your petition [in prayer] was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John.",
      "14": "You will have great joy and delight, and many will rejoice over his birth,",
      "15": "for he will be great and distinguished in the sight of the Lord; and will never drink wine or liquor, and he will be filled with and empowered to act by the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb.",
      "16": "He will turn many of the sons of Israel back [from sin] to [love and serve] the Lord their God.",
      "17": "It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous [which is to seek and submit to the will of God]—in order to make ready a people [perfectly] prepared [spiritually and morally] for the Lord.”",
      "18": "And Zacharias said to the angel, “How will I be certain of this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in age.”",
      "19": "The angel replied and said to him, “I am Gabriel; I stand and minister in the [very] presence of God, and I have been sent [by Him] to speak to you and to bring you this good news.",
      "20": "Listen carefully, you will be continually silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe what I told you; but my words will be fulfilled at their proper time.”",
      "21": "The people [outside in the court] were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering about his long delay in the temple.",
      "22": "But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute.",
      "23": "When his time of priestly service was finished, he returned to his home.",
      "24": "Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she secluded herself completely, saying,",
      "25": "“This is how the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor on me, to take away my disgrace among men.”",
      "26": "Now in the sixth month [of Elizabeth’s pregnancy] the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,",
      "27": "to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.",
      "28": "And coming to her, the angel said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”",
      "29": "But she was greatly perplexed at what he said, and kept carefully considering what kind of greeting this was.",
      "30": "The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.",
      "31": "Listen carefully: you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.",
      "32": "He will be great and eminent and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;",
      "33": "and He will reign over the house of Jacob (Israel) forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.”",
      "34": "Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin and have no intimacy with any man?”",
      "35": "Then the angel replied to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [like a cloud]; for that reason the holy (pure, sinless) Child shall be called the Son of God.",
      "36": "And listen, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month.",
      "37": "For with God nothing [is or ever] shall be impossible.”",
      "38": "Then Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel left her.",
      "39": "Now at this time Mary arose and hurried to the hill country, to a city of Judah (Judea),",
      "40": "and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.",
      "41": "When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, her baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and empowered by Him.",
      "42": "And she exclaimed loudly, “Blessed [worthy to be praised] are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!",
      "43": "And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?",
      "44": "For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.",
      "45": "And blessed [spiritually fortunate and favored by God] is she who believed and confidently trusted that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her [by the angel sent] from the Lord.”",
      "46": "And Mary said,\n“My soul magnifies and exalts the Lord,",
      "47": "And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.",
      "48": "“For He has looked [with loving care] on the humble state of His maidservant;\nFor behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed and happy and favored by God!",
      "49": "“For He who is mighty has done great things for me;\nAnd holy is His name [to be worshiped in His purity, majesty, and glory].",
      "50": "“And His mercy is upon generation after generation\nToward those who [stand in great awe of God and] fear Him.",
      "51": "“He has done mighty deeds with His [powerful] arm;\nHe has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart.",
      "52": "“He has brought down rulers from their thrones,\nAnd exalted those who were humble.",
      "53": "“He has filled the hungry with good things;\nAnd sent the rich away empty-handed.",
      "54": "“He has helped His servant Israel,\nIn remembrance of His mercy,",
      "55": "Just as He promised to our fathers,\nTo Abraham and to his descendants forever.”",
      "56": "And Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months, and then returned to her home.",
      "57": "Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son.",
      "58": "Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown His great mercy toward her, and they were rejoicing with her.",
      "59": "It happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child [as required by the Law], and they intended to name him Zacharias, after his father;",
      "60": "but his mother answered, “No indeed; instead he will be called John.”",
      "61": "And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by that name.”",
      "62": "Then they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called.",
      "63": "And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote as follows, “His name is John.” And they were all astonished.",
      "64": "At once Zacharias’ mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began speaking, praising and blessing and thanking God.",
      "65": "Then fear came on all their neighbors; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea.",
      "66": "All who heard these things kept them in mind, saying, “What then will this little boy turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him [to bring about his birth].",
      "67": "Now Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and empowered by Him, and he prophesied, saying,",
      "68": "“Blessed (praised, glorified) be the Lord, the God of Israel,\nBecause He has visited us and brought redemption to His people,",
      "69": "And He has raised up a horn of salvation [a mighty and valiant Savior] for us\nIn the house of David His servant—",
      "70": "Just as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times—",
      "71": "Salvation from our enemies,\nAnd from the hand of all who hate us;",
      "72": "To show mercy [as He promised] to our fathers,\nAnd to remember His holy covenant [the promised blessing],",
      "73": "The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,",
      "74": "To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,\nMight serve Him without fear,",
      "75": "In holiness [being set apart] and righteousness [being upright] before Him all our days.",
      "76": "“And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;\nFor you will go on before the Lord (the Messiah) to prepare His ways;",
      "77": "To give His people the knowledge of salvation\nBy the forgiveness of their sins,",
      "78": "Because of the tender mercy of our God,\nWith which the Sunrise (the Messiah) from on high will dawn and visit us,",
      "79": "To shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,\nTo guide our feet [in a straight line] into the way of peace and serenity.”",
      "80": "The child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel [as John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Messiah]."

      "1": "Now in those days a decree went out from [the emperor] Caesar Augustus, that all the inhabited world (the Roman Empire) should be registered [in a census].",
      "2": "This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.",
      "3": "And everyone went to register for the census, each to his own city.",
      "4": "So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,",
      "5": "in order to register with Mary, who was betrothed to him, and was with child.",
      "6": "While they were there [in Bethlehem], the time came for her to give birth,",
      "7": "and she gave birth to her Son, her firstborn; and she wrapped Him in [swaddling] cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no [private] room for them in the inn.",
      "8": "In the same region there were shepherds staying out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.",
      "9": "And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord flashed and shone around them, and they were terribly frightened.",
      "10": "But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people.",
      "11": "For this day in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (the Messiah).",
      "12": "And this will be a sign for you [by which you will recognize Him]: you will find a Baby wrapped in [swaddling] cloths and lying in a manger.”",
      "13": "Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host (angelic army) praising God and saying,",
      "14": "“Glory to God in the highest [heaven],\nAnd on earth peace among men with whom He is well-pleased.”",
      "15": "When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying one to another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem, and see this [wonderful] thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”",
      "16": "So they went in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the Baby as He lay in the manger.",
      "17": "And when they had seen this, they made known what had been told them about this Child,",
      "18": "and all who heard it were astounded and wondered at what the shepherds told them.",

      "8": "And some fell into good soil, and grew up and produced a crop a hundred times as great.” As He said these things, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear and heed My words.”",
      "9": "Now His disciples began asking Him what this parable meant.",
      "10": "And He said, “To you [who have been chosen] it has been granted to know and recognize the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that though seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.",
      "11": "“Now [the meaning of] the parable is this: The seed is the word of God [concerning eternal salvation].",
      "12": "Those beside the road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and takes the message [of God] away from their hearts, so that they will not believe [in Me as the Messiah] and be saved.",
      "13": "Those on the rocky soil are the people who, when they hear, receive and welcome the word with joy; but these have no firmly grounded root. They believe for a while, and in time of trial and temptation they fall away [from Me and abandon their faith].",
      "14": "The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but as they go on their way they are suffocated with the anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, and they bring no fruit to maturity.",
      "15": "But as for that seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word with a good and noble heart, and hold on to it tightly, and bear fruit with patience.",

      "22": "Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake (Sea of Galilee).” So they set out.",
      "23": "But as they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a fierce gale of wind swept down [as if through a wind tunnel] on the lake, and they began to be swamped, and were in great danger.",
      "24": "They came to Jesus and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are about to die!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging, violent waves, and they ceased, and it became calm [a perfect peacefulness].",

      "27": "Now when Jesus stepped out on land, He was met by a man from the city [of Gerasa] who was possessed with demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and was not living in a house, but among the tombs.",
      "28": "Seeing Jesus, he cried out [with a terrible voice from the depths of his throat] and fell down before Him [in dread and terror], and shouted loudly, “What business do we have [in common] with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me [before the appointed time of judgment]!”",
      "29": "Now He was [already] commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him [violently] many times; and he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.",
      "30": "Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he answered, “Legion”; because many demons had entered him.",
      "31": "They continually begged Him not to command them to go into the abyss.",
      "32": "Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the mountain. The demons begged Jesus to allow them to enter the pigs, and He gave them permission.",
      "33": "Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.",
      "34": "When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told it in the city and out in the country.",
      "35": "And people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind (mentally healthy); and they were frightened.",
      "36": "Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.",
      "37": "Then all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, because they were overwhelmed with fear. So Jesus got into the boat and returned [to the west side of the Sea of Galilee].",
      "38": "But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Him, pleading to go with Him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,",
      "39": "“Return home and tell [about] all the great things God has done for you.” So the man went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.",
      "40": "Now as Jesus was returning [to Galilee], the people welcomed Him, for they had all been expecting Him.",
      "41": "Now a man named Jairus, a synagogue official, came [to Him]; and he fell at Jesus’ feet and began begging Him to come to his house;",
      "42": "for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as Jesus went, the people were crowding against Him [almost crushing Him].",
      "43": "And a woman who had [suffered from] a hemorrhage for twelve years [and had spent all her money on physicians], and could not be healed by anyone,",
      "44": "came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His outer robe, and immediately her bleeding stopped.",
      "45": "Jesus said, “Who touched Me?” While they all were denying it, Peter [and those who were with him] said, “Master, the people are crowding and pushing against You!”",
      "46": "But Jesus said, “Someone did touch Me, because I was aware that power [to heal] had gone out of Me.”",
      "47": "When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came up trembling and fell down before Him. She declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.",
      "48": "He said to her, “Daughter, your faith [your personal trust and confidence in Me] has made you well. Go in peace (untroubled, undisturbed well-being).”",
      "49": "While He was still speaking, someone from the synagogue official’s house came and said [to Jairus], “Your daughter is dead; do not inconvenience the Teacher any further.”",
      "50": "But Jesus, hearing this, answered him, “Do not be afraid any longer; only believe and trust [in Me and have faith in My ability to do this], and she will be made well.”",
      "51": "When He came to the house, He allowed no one to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother.",
      "52": "Now they were all weeping loudly and mourning for her; but He said, “Do not weep, for she is not dead, but is sleeping.”",
      "53": "Then they began laughing scornfully at Him and ridiculing Him, knowing [without any doubt] that she was dead.",
      "54": "But Jesus took hold of her hand and spoke, saying, “Child, arise!”",
      "55": "And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He ordered that she be given something to eat.",
      "56": "Her parents were greatly astonished [by the miracle]; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened."

    "9": {
      "1": "Now Jesus called together the twelve [disciples] and gave them [the right to exercise] power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.",
      "2": "Then He sent them out [on a brief journey] to preach the kingdom of God and to perform healing.",
      "3": "And He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey [that might encumber you]—neither a walking stick, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not even have two tunics apiece.",

      "6": "So they began going from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing the sick everywhere.",
      "7": "Now Herod [Antipas] the tetrarch [who governed a portion of Palestine including Galilee and Perea] heard about all that was being done [by Jesus], and he was thoroughly perplexed, because it was said by some that John [the Baptist whom he had ordered beheaded] had been raised from the dead,",

      "11": "But when the crowds learned of it, they followed Him; and He welcomed them and He began talking to them about the kingdom of God, and healing those who needed to be healed.",
      "12": "Now the day was ending, and the twelve [disciples] came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging, and get provisions; because here we are in an isolated place.”",
      "13": "But He said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.”",
      "14": "(For there were about 5,000 men.) And He said to His disciples, “Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each.”",
      "15": "They did so, and had them all sit down.",
      "16": "Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and He looked up to heaven [and gave thanks] and blessed them, and broke them and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.",
      "17": "They all ate and were [completely] satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were [abundant and were] picked up—twelve baskets full.",
      "18": "Now it happened that as Jesus was praying privately, the disciples were with Him, and He asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”",
      "19": "They answered, “John the Baptist, and some say, Elijah; but others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life.”",
      "20": "And He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter replied, “The Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) of God!”",
      "21": "But He strictly warned and admonished them not to tell this to anyone,",
      "22": "saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected [as the Messiah] by the elders and chief priests and scribes (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), and be put to death, and on the third day be raised up [from death to life].”",
      "23": "And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wishes to follow Me [as My disciple], he must deny himself [set aside selfish interests], and take up his cross daily [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] and follow Me [believing in Me, conforming to My example in living and, if need be, suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me].",
      "24": "For whoever wishes to save his life [in this world] will [eventually] lose it [through death], but whoever loses his life [in this world] for My sake, he is the one who will save it [from the consequences of sin and separation from God].",
      "25": "For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world [wealth, fame, success], and loses or forfeits himself?",
      "26": "For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the [heavenly] Father and of the holy angels.",
      "27": "But I tell you truthfully, there are some among those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”",
      "28": "Now about eight days after these teachings, He took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.",
      "29": "As He was praying, the appearance of His face became different [actually transformed], and His clothing became white and flashing with the brilliance of lightning.",

      "34": "But even as he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were [greatly] afraid as they entered the cloud.",
      "35": "Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, My Chosen One; listen and obey and yield to Him!”",
      "36": "When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found there alone. And they kept silent, and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen [concerning the divine manifestation].",
      "37": "On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.",
      "38": "And a man from the crowd shouted for help, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only child;",

      "45": "However, they did not understand this statement. Its meaning was kept hidden from them so that they would not grasp it; and they were afraid to ask Him about it.",
      "46": "An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest [surpassing the others in esteem and authority].",
      "47": "But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and had him stand beside Him,",

      "49": "John replied, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name; and we tried to stop him because he does not follow along with us.”",

      "57": "As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”",
