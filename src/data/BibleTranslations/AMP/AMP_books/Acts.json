      "3": "To these [men] He also showed Himself alive after His suffering [in Gethsemane and on the cross], by [a series of] many infallible proofs and unquestionable demonstrations, appearing to them over a period of forty days and talking to them about the things concerning the kingdom of God.",
      "4": "While being together and eating with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, “Of which,” He said, “you have heard Me speak.",
      "5": "For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized and empowered and united with the Holy Spirit, not long from now.”",
      "6": "So when they had come together, they asked Him repeatedly, “Lord, are You at this time reestablishing the kingdom and restoring it to Israel?”",
      "7": "He said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority.",
      "8": "But you will receive power and ability when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be My witnesses [to tell people about Me] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.”",

      "11": "who said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This [same] Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”",
      "12": "Then the disciples returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet (Olive Grove), which is near Jerusalem, [only] a Sabbath day’s journey (less than one mile) away.",
      "13": "When they had entered the city, they went upstairs to the upper room where they were staying [indefinitely]; that is, Peter, and John and [his brother] James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew (Nathanael) and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas (Thaddaeus) the son of James.",
      "14": "All these with one mind and one purpose were continually devoting themselves to prayer, [waiting together] along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.",
      "15": "Now on one of these days Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty believers was there) and he said,",
      "16": "“Brothers and sisters, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David [king of Israel] about Judas [Iscariot], who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.",
      "17": "For he (Judas) was counted among us and received his share [by divine allotment] in this ministry.”",

      "23": "And they put forward two men, Joseph, the one called Barsabbas (who was surnamed Justus), and Matthias.",
      "24": "They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know all hearts [their thoughts, motives, desires], show us which one of these two You have chosen",

      "6": "And when this sound was heard, a crowd gathered, and they were bewildered because each one was hearing those in the upper room speaking in his own language or dialect.",
      "7": "They were completely astonished, saying, “Look! Are not all of these who are speaking Galileans?",
      "8": "Then how is it that each of us hears in our own language or native dialect?",

      "12": "And they were beside themselves with amazement and were greatly perplexed, saying one to another, “What could this mean?”",
      "13": "But others were laughing and joking and ridiculing them, saying, “They are full of sweet wine and are drunk!”",
      "14": "But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be explained to you; listen closely and pay attention to what I have to say.",
      "15": "These people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is [only] the third hour of the day (9:00 a.m.);",

      "24": "But God raised Him up, releasing Him and bringing an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in death’s power.",

      "26": "‘Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted exceedingly;\nMoreover my flesh also will live in hope [that is, will encamp in anticipation of the resurrection];",

      "31": "he foresaw and spoke [prophetically] of the resurrection of the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), that He was not abandoned [in death] to Hades (the realm of the dead), nor did His body undergo decay.",
      "32": "God raised this Jesus [bodily from the dead], and of that [fact] we are all witnesses.",
      "33": "Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this [blessing] which you both see and hear.",

      "36": "Therefore let all the house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt that God has made Him both Lord and Christ (Messiah, Anointed)—this Jesus whom you crucified.”",
      "37": "Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart [with remorse and anxiety], and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what are we to do?”",
      "38": "And Peter said to them, “Repent [change your old way of thinking, turn from your sinful ways, accept and follow Jesus as the Messiah] and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ because of the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
      "39": "For the promise [of the Holy Spirit] is for you and your children and for all who are far away [including the Gentiles], as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.”",
      "40": "And Peter solemnly testified and continued to admonish and urge them with many more words, saying, “Be saved from this crooked and unjust generation!”",
      "41": "So then, those who accepted his message were baptized; and on that day about 3,000 souls were added [to the body of believers].",
      "42": "They were continually and faithfully devoting themselves to the instruction of the apostles, and to fellowship, to eating meals together and to prayers.",
      "43": "A sense of awe was felt by everyone, and many wonders and signs (attesting miracles) were taking place through the apostles.",
      "44": "And all those who had believed [in Jesus as Savior] were together and had all things in common [considering their possessions to belong to the group as a whole].",
      "45": "And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing the proceeds with all [the other believers], as anyone had need.",
      "46": "Day after day they met in the temple [area] continuing with one mind, and breaking bread in various private homes. They were eating their meals together with joy and generous hearts,",

      "11": "Therefore, if I am guilty and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not try to escape death; but if there is nothing to the accusations which these men are bringing against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar (Emperor Nero).”",
      "12": "Then Festus, after conferring with [the men who formed] his council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”",
      "13": "Now several days later, Agrippa [II] the king and Bernice [his sister] arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus [the new governor].",
      "14": "While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man here who was left as a prisoner by Felix.",
      "15": "When I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews [told me about him and] brought charges against him, petitioning for a sentence of condemnation against him.",
      "16": "I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man [for punishment] before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has the opportunity to defend himself against the charges.",
      "17": "So after they arrived together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my place on the tribunal and ordered that the man be brought before me.",
      "18": "When his accusers stood up, they brought no charges against him of crimes that I was expecting [neither civil nor criminal actions],",
      "19": "instead they had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about one Jesus, a man who had died, but whom Paul kept asserting and insisting [over and over] to be alive.",
      "20": "And I, being at a loss as to how to investigate these things, asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding these matters.",
      "21": "But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for a decision by the Emperor [Nero], I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”",
      "22": "Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” Festus replied, “you will hear him.”",
      "23": "So the next day Agrippa and [his sister] Bernice came with great pageantry, and they went into the auditorium accompanied by the military commanders and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.",
      "24": "Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all you gentlemen present with us, you see this man [Paul] about whom all the Jewish people appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly insisting that he ought not to live any longer.",
      "25": "But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; however, since he appealed to the Emperor [Nero], I decided to send him [to Rome].",
      "26": "But I have nothing specific about him to write to my lord. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I will have something to put in writing.",
      "27": "For it seems absurd and unreasonable to me to send a prisoner [to Rome] without indicating the charges against him.”"

    "26": {
      "1": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are [now] permitted to speak on your own behalf.” At that, Paul stretched out his hand [as an orator] and made his defense [as follows]:",
      "2": "“I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, since it is before you that I am to make my defense today regarding all the charges brought against me by the Jews,",
      "3": "especially because you are an expert [fully knowledgeable, experienced and unusually conversant] in all the Jewish customs and controversial issues; therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.",
      "4": "“So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation [the Jewish people], and in Jerusalem.",
      "5": "They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify to it, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I have lived as a Pharisee.",
      "6": "And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.",
      "7": "Which hope [of the Messiah and the resurrection] our twelve tribes [confidently] expect to realize as they serve and worship God in earnest night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews!",
      "8": "Why is it thought incredible by [any of] you that God raises the dead?",
      "9": "“So then, I [once] thought to myself that it was my duty to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",
      "10": "And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only locked up many of the saints (God’s people) in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being condemned to death, I cast my vote against them.",
      "11": "And I often punished them [making them suffer] in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme; and in my extreme rage at them, I kept hunting them even to foreign cities [harassing and persecuting them].",
      "12": "“While so engaged, as I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission and full power of the chief priests,",
      "13": "at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun, shining all around me and those who were traveling with me.",
      "14": "And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice in the Hebrew dialect (Jewish Aramaic) saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick [repeatedly] against the goads [offering pointless resistance].’",
      "15": "And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.",
      "16": "Get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you [to serve] as a minister and as a witness [to testify, with authority,] not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you,",
      "17": "[choosing you for Myself and] rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,",
      "18": "to open their [spiritual] eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness and release from their sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified (set apart, made holy) by faith in Me.’",
      "19": "“So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,",
      "20": "but I openly proclaimed first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent [change their inner self—their old way of thinking] and turn to God, doing deeds and living lives which are consistent with repentance.",
      "21": "Because of this some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.",
      "22": "But I have had help from God to this day, and I stand [before people] testifying to small and great alike, stating nothing except what the Prophets and Moses said would come to pass—",
      "23": "that the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) was to suffer, and that He by being the first to rise from the dead [with an incorruptible body] would proclaim light (salvation) both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.”",
      "24": "While Paul was making this defense, Festus said loudly, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great education is turning you toward madness.”",
      "25": "But Paul replied, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent and noble Festus, but [with a sound mind] I am uttering rational words of truth and reason.",
      "26": "For [your majesty] the king understands these things, and [therefore] I am also speaking to him with confidence and boldness, since I am convinced that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner [hidden from view, in secret].",
      "27": "King Agrippa, do you believe the [writings of the] Prophets [their messages and words]? I know that you do.”",
      "28": "Then Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time [and with so little effort] you [almost] persuade me to become a Christian.”",
      "29": "And Paul replied, “Whether in a short time or long, I wish to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”",
      "30": "Then the king stood up, and [with him] the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them;",
      "31": "and after they had gone out, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything worthy of death or [even] of imprisonment.”",

      "10": "saying, “Men, I sense [after careful thought and observation] that this voyage will certainly be a disaster and with great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”",
      "11": "However, the centurion [Julius, ranking officer on board] was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship rather than by what Paul said.",
      "12": "Because the harbor was not well situated for wintering, the majority [of the sailors] decided to put to sea from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.",
      "13": "So when the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had obtained their goal, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, hugging the coast.",
      "14": "But soon afterward a violent wind, called Euraquilo [a northeaster, a tempestuous windstorm like a typhoon], came rushing down from the island;",
      "15": "and when the ship was caught in it and could not head against the wind [to gain stability], we gave up and [letting her drift] were driven along.",
      "16": "We ran under the shelter of a small island [twenty-five miles south of Crete] called Clauda, and with great difficulty we were able to get the ship’s skiff on the deck and secure it.",
      "17": "After hoisting the skiff [on board], they used support lines [for frapping] to undergird and brace the ship’s hull; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis [off the north coast of Africa], they let down the sea anchor and lowered the sails and were driven along [backwards with the bow into the wind].",
      "18": "On the next day, as we were being violently tossed about by the storm [and taking on water], they began to jettison the cargo;",

      "31": "Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved.”",
      "32": "Then the soldiers cut away the ropes that held the skiff and let it fall and drift away.",

      "39": "When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, and they decided to run the ship ashore there if they could.",
      "40": "So they cut the cables and severed the anchors and left them in the sea while at the same time unlashing the ropes of the rudders; and after hoisting the foresail to the wind, they headed steadily for the beach.",
      "41": "But striking a reef with waves breaking in on either side, they ran the ship aground. The prow (forward point) stuck fast and remained immovable, while the stern began to break up under the [violent] force of the waves.",
      "42": "The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would dive overboard and swim [to land] and escape;",
