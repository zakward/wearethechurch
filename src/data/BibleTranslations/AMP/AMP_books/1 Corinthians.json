      "3": "Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,",
      "5": "so that in everything you were [exceedingly] enriched in Him, in all speech [empowered by the spiritual gifts] and in all knowledge [with insight into the faith].",
      "6": "In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed and established in you,",
      "7": "so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift [which comes from the Holy Spirit], as you eagerly wait [with confident trust] for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ [when He returns].",
      "8": "And He will also confirm you to the end [keeping you strong and free of any accusation, so that you will be] blameless and beyond reproach in the day [of the return] of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful [He is reliable, trustworthy and ever true to His promise—He can be depended on], and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "But I urge you, believers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in full agreement in what you say, and that there be no divisions or factions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your way of thinking and in your judgment [about matters of the faith].",
      "11": "For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe’s household, that there are quarrels and factions among you.",
      "12": "Now I mean this, that each one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” or “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” or “I am [a disciple] of Cephas (Peter),” or “I am [a disciple] of Christ.”",
      "13": "Has Christ been divided [into different parts]? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? [Certainly not!]",

      "15": "so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name.",
      "16": "Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know if I baptized anyone else.",
      "17": "For Christ did not send me [as an apostle] to baptize, but [commissioned and empowered me] to preach the good news [of salvation]—not with clever and eloquent speech [as an orator], so that the cross of Christ would not be made ineffective [deprived of its saving power].",
      "18": "For the message of the cross is foolishness [absurd and illogical] to those who are perishing and spiritually dead [because they reject it], but to us who are being saved [by God’s grace] it is [the manifestation of] the power of God.",
      "19": "For it is written and forever remains written,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise [the philosophy of the philosophers],\nAnd the cleverness of the clever [who do not know Me] I will nullify.”",
      "20": "Where is the wise man (philosopher)? Where is the scribe (scholar)? Where is the debater (logician, orator) of this age? Has God not exposed the foolishness of this world’s wisdom?",
      "21": "For since the world through all its [earthly] wisdom failed to recognize God, God in His wisdom was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached [regarding salvation] to save those who believe [in Christ and welcome Him as Savior].",
      "22": "For Jews demand signs (attesting miracles), and Greeks pursue [worldly] wisdom and philosophy,",
      "23": "but we preach Christ crucified, [a message which is] to Jews a stumbling block [that provokes their opposition], and to Gentiles foolishness [just utter nonsense],",
      "24": "but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "[This is] because the foolishness of God [is not foolishness at all and] is wiser than men [far beyond human comprehension], and the weakness of God is stronger than men [far beyond the limits of human effort].",
      "26": "Just look at your own calling, believers; not many [of you were considered] wise according to human standards, not many powerful or influential, not many of high and noble birth.",
      "27": "But God has selected [for His purpose] the foolish things of the world to shame the wise [revealing their ignorance], and God has selected [for His purpose] the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong [revealing their frailty].",
      "28": "God has selected [for His purpose] the insignificant (base) things of the world, and the things that are despised and treated with contempt, [even] the things that are nothing, so that He might reduce to nothing the things that are,",
      "29": "so that no one may [be able to] boast in the presence of God.",
      "30": "But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God [revealing His plan of salvation], and righteousness [making us acceptable to God], and sanctification [making us holy and setting us apart for God], and redemption [providing our ransom from the penalty for sin],",
      "31": "so then, as it is written [in Scripture], “He who boasts and glories, let him boast and glory in the Lord.”"

      "2": "for I made the decision to know nothing [that is, to forego philosophical or theological discussions regarding inconsequential things and opinions while] among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified [and the meaning of His redemptive, substitutionary death and His resurrection].",
      "3": "I came to you in [a state of] weakness and fear and great trembling.",
      "4": "And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom [using clever rhetoric], but [they were delivered] in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit [operating through me] and of [His] power [stirring the minds of the listeners and persuading them],",
      "5": "so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom and rhetoric of men, but on the power of God.",
      "6": "Yet we do speak wisdom among those spiritually mature [believers who have teachable hearts and a greater understanding]; but [it is a higher] wisdom not [the wisdom] of this present age nor of the rulers and leaders of this age, who are passing away;",
      "7": "but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom once hidden [from man, but now revealed to us by God, that wisdom] which God predestined before the ages to our glory [to lift us into the glory of His presence].",
      "8": "None of the rulers of this age recognized and understood this wisdom; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;",
      "9": "but just as it is written [in Scripture],\n“Things which the eye has not seen and the ear has not heard,\nAnd which have not entered the heart of man,\nAll that God has prepared for those who love Him [who hold Him in affectionate reverence, who obey Him, and who gratefully recognize the benefits that He has bestowed].”",
      "10": "For God has unveiled them and revealed them to us through the [Holy] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things [diligently], even [sounding and measuring] the [profound] depths of God [the divine counsels and things far beyond human understanding].",
      "11": "For what person knows the thoughts and motives of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So also no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the [Holy] Spirit who is from God, so that we may know and understand the [wonderful] things freely given to us by God.",
      "13": "We also speak of these things, not in words taught or supplied by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining and interpreting spiritual thoughts with spiritual words [for those being guided by the Holy Spirit].",
      "14": "But the natural [unbelieving] man does not accept the things [the teachings and revelations] of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness [absurd and illogical] to him; and he is incapable of understanding them, because they are spiritually discerned and appreciated, [and he is unqualified to judge spiritual matters].",
      "15": "But the spiritual man [the spiritually mature Christian] judges all things [questions, examines and applies what the Holy Spirit reveals], yet is himself judged by no one [the unbeliever cannot judge and understand the believer’s spiritual nature].",
      "16": "For who has known the mind and purposes of the Lord, so as to instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ [to be guided by His thoughts and purposes]."

      "3": "You are still worldly [controlled by ordinary impulses, the sinful capacity]. For as long as there is jealousy and strife and discord among you, are you not unspiritual, and are you not walking like ordinary men [unchanged by faith]?",
      "4": "For when one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” and another, “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” are you not [proving yourselves unchanged, just] ordinary people?",
      "5": "What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was causing the growth.",
      "7": "So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything, but [only] God who causes the growth.",
      "8": "He who plants and he who waters are one [in importance and esteem, working toward the same purpose]; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
      "9": "For we are God’s fellow workers [His servants working together]; you are God’s cultivated field [His garden, His vineyard], God’s building.",
      "10": "According to the [remarkable] grace of God which was given to me [to prepare me for my task], like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation, and now another is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it,",
      "11": "for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,",
      "13": "each one’s work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality and character and worth of each person’s work.",
      "14": "If any person’s work which he has built [on this foundation, that is, any outcome of his effort] remains [and survives this test], he will receive a reward.",
      "15": "But if any person’s work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire.",
      "16": "Do you not know and understand that you [the church] are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells [permanently] in you [collectively and individually]?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys the temple of God [corrupting it with false doctrine], God will destroy the destroyer; for the temple of God is holy (sacred), and that is what you are.",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom], so that he may become [truly] wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness (absurdity, stupidity) before God; for it is written [in Scripture], “[He is] The one who catches the wise and clever in their craftiness;”",
      "20": "and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the [humanly] wise, that they are useless.”",
      "21": "So let no one boast in men [about their wisdom, or of having this or that one as a leader]. For all things are yours,",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things are yours,",

      "2": "In this case, moreover, it is required [as essential and demanded] of stewards that one be found faithful and trustworthy.",
      "3": "But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I may be judged by you or any human court [on this point]; in fact, I do not even judge myself.",
      "4": "I am aware of nothing against myself and I feel blameless, but I am not by this acquitted [before God]. It is the Lord who judges me.",
      "5": "So do not go on passing judgment before the appointed time, but wait until the Lord comes, for He will both bring to light the [secret] things that are hidden in darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts. Then each one’s praise will come from God.",
      "6": "Now I have applied these things [that is, the analogies about factions] to myself and Apollos for your benefit, believers, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written [in Scripture], so that none of you will become arrogant and boast in favor of one [minister or teacher] against the other.",
      "7": "For who regards you as superior or what sets you apart as special? What do you have that you did not receive [from another]? And if in fact you received it [from God or someone else], why do you boast as if you had not received it [but had gained it by yourself]?",
      "8": "[You behave as if] you are already filled [with spiritual wisdom and in need of nothing more]. Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts]! You [in your conceit] have ascended your thrones and become kings without us; and how I wish [that it were true and] that you did reign as kings, so that we might reign with you.",
      "9": "For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles at the end of the line, like men sentenced to death [and paraded as prisoners in a procession], because we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world’s amphitheater], both to angels and to men.",
      "10": "We are [regarded as] fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are highly esteemed, but we are dishonored.",

      "12": "We work [for our living], working hard with our own hands. When we are reviled and verbally abused, we bless. When we are persecuted, we take it patiently and endure.",
      "13": "When we are slandered, we try to be conciliatory and answer softly. We have become like the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now.",
      "14": "I do not write these things to shame you, but to warn and advise you as my beloved children.",
      "15": "For even if you were to have ten thousand teachers [to guide you] in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers [who led you to Christ and assumed responsibility for you], for I became your father in Christ Jesus through the good news [of salvation].",
      "16": "So I urge you, be imitators of me [just as a child imitates his father].",
      "17": "For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my way of life in Christ [my conduct and my precepts for godly living], just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "Now some of you have become arrogant and pretentious, as though I were not coming to see you.",

      "6": "Now, believers, if I come to you speaking in unknown tongues, how will I benefit you unless I also speak to you [clearly] either by revelation [revealing God’s mystery], or by knowledge [teaching about God], or by prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], or by instruction [teaching precepts that develop spiritual maturity]?",
      "7": "Yet even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, when producing a sound, if they do not produce distinct [musical] tones, how will anyone [listening] know what is piped or played?",
      "8": "And if the [war] bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?",
      "9": "So it is with you, if you speak words [in an unknown tongue] that are not intelligible and clear, how will anyone understand what you are saying? You will be talking into the air [wasting your breath]!",
      "10": "There are, I suppose, a great many kinds of languages in the world [unknown to us], and none is lacking in meaning.",
      "11": "But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will [appear to] be a foreigner to the one who is speaking [since he knows exactly what he is saying], and the one who is speaking will [appear to] be a foreigner to me.",
      "12": "So it is with you, since you are so very eager to have spiritual gifts and manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in ways that will build up the church [spiritually].",
      "13": "Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [be gifted to] translate or explain [what he says].",
      "14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive [because it does not understand what my spirit is praying].",
      "15": "Then what am I to do? I will pray with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will pray with the mind [using words I understand]; I will sing with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will sing with the mind [using words I understand].",
      "16": "Otherwise if you bless [and give thanks to God] in the spirit only, how will any outsider or someone who is not gifted [in spiritual matters] say the “Amen” [of agreement] to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?",
      "17": "You are giving thanks well enough [in a way that God is glorified], but the other person [who does not understand you] is not edified [and spiritually strengthened since he cannot join in your thanksgiving].",
      "18": "I thank God that I speak in [unknown] tongues more than all of you;",
      "19": "nevertheless, in public worship I would rather say five understandable words in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue [which others cannot understand].",
      "20": "Brothers and sisters, do not be children [immature, childlike] in your thinking; be infants in [matters of] evil [completely innocent and inexperienced], but in your minds be mature [adults].",
      "21": "It is written in the Law, “By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and not even then will they listen to Me,” says the Lord.",
      "22": "Therefore, [unknown] tongues are [meant] for a [supernatural] sign, not to believers but to unbelievers [who might be receptive]; while prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people] is not for unbelievers but for believers.",
      "23": "So then, if the whole church gathers together and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues, and outsiders or those who are not gifted [in spiritual matters] or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?",
      "24": "But if all prophesy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and an unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is convicted [of his sins] by all, and he is called to account by all [because he can understand what is being said];",
      "25": "the secrets of his heart are laid bare. And so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is really among you.",
      "26": "What then is the right course, believers? When you meet together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation (disclosure of special knowledge), a tongue, or an interpretation. Let everything be constructive and edifying and done for the good of all the church.",
      "27": "If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be limited to two or at the most three, and each one speaking in turn, and one must interpret [what is said].",
      "28": "But if there is no one to interpret, the one [who wishes to speak in a tongue] must keep silent in church; let him speak to himself and to God.",
      "29": "Let two or three prophets speak [as inspired by the Holy Spirit], while the rest pay attention and weigh carefully what is said.",
      "30": "But if an inspired revelation is made to another who is seated, then the first one must be silent.",
      "31": "For [in this way] you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may be instructed and everyone may be encouraged;",
      "32": "for the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets [the prophecy is under the speaker’s control, and he can stop speaking];",
      "33": "for God [who is the source of their prophesying] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order.\nAs [is the practice] in all the churches of the saints (God’s people),",
      "34": "the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not authorized to speak, but are to take a subordinate place, as the Law says.",
      "35": "If there is anything they want to learn [that is, if they have questions about anything being said or taught], they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to talk in church.",
      "36": "Did the word of the Lord originate from you [Corinthians], or has it come to you only [so that you know best what God requires]?",
      "37": "If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [a true spokesman for God] or spiritually astute [filled with and energized by the Holy Spirit], let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord’s commandment.",
      "38": "If anyone does not recognize this [that it is a command of the Lord], he is not recognized [by God].",
      "39": "Therefore, believers, desire earnestly to prophesy [to foretell the future, to speak a new message from God to the people], and do not forbid speaking in unknown tongues.",
      "40": "But all things must be done appropriately and in an orderly manner."

      "1": "Now brothers and sisters, let me remind you [once again] of the good news [of salvation] which I preached to you, which you welcomed and accepted and on which you stand [by faith].",
      "2": "By this faith you are saved [reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose], if you hold firmly to the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain [just superficially and without complete commitment].",
      "3": "For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold],",
      "4": "and that He was buried, and that He was [bodily] raised on the third day according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold],",
      "5": "and that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve.",
      "6": "After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep [in death].",
      "7": "Then He was seen by James, then by all the apostles,",
      "8": "and last of all, as to one untimely (prematurely, traumatically) born, He appeared to me also.",
      "9": "For I am the least [worthy] of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I [at one time] fiercely oppressed and violently persecuted the church of God.",
      "10": "But by the [remarkable] grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not without effect. In fact, I worked harder than all of the apostles, though it was not I, but the grace of God [His unmerited favor and blessing which was] with me.",
      "11": "So whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed and trusted in and relied on with confidence.",
      "12": "Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
      "13": "But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;",
      "14": "and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain [useless, amounting to nothing], and your faith is also vain [imaginary, unfounded, devoid of value and benefit—not based on truth].",
      "15": "We are even discovered to be false witnesses [misrepresenting] God, because we testified concerning Him that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.",
      "16": "For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised, either;",
      "17": "and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and powerless [mere delusion]; you are still in your sins [and under the control and penalty of sin].",
      "18": "Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.",
      "19": "If we who are [abiding] in Christ have hoped only in this life [and this is all there is], then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied.",
      "20": "But now [as things really are] Christ has in fact been raised from the dead, [and He became] the first fruits [that is, the first to be resurrected with an incorruptible, immortal body, foreshadowing the resurrection] of those who have fallen asleep [in death].",
      "21": "For since [it was] by a man that death came [into the world], it is also by a Man that the resurrection of the dead has come.",
      "22": "For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.",
      "23": "But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s [own will be resurrected with incorruptible, immortal bodies] at His coming.",
      "24": "After that comes the end (completion), when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after He has made inoperative and abolished every ruler and every authority and power.",
      "25": "For Christ must reign [as King] until He has put all His enemies under His feet.",
      "26": "The last enemy to be abolished and put to an end is death.",
      "27": "For He (the Father) has put all things in subjection under His (Christ’s) feet. But when He says, “All things have been put in subjection [under Christ],” it is clear that He (the Father) who put all things in subjection to Him (Christ) is excepted [since the Father is not in subjection to His own Son].",
      "28": "However, when all things are subjected to Him (Christ), then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One (the Father) who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all [manifesting His glory without any opposition, the supreme indwelling and controlling factor of life].",
      "29": "Otherwise, what will those do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people even baptized for them?",
      "30": "[For that matter] why are we [running such risks and putting ourselves] in danger [nearly] every hour [if there is no resurrection]?",
      "31": "I assure you, believers, by the pride which I have in you in [your union with] Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily [I face death and die to self].",
      "32": "What good has it done me if, [merely] from a human point of view, I fought with wild animals at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised [at all], let us eat and drink [enjoying ourselves now], for tomorrow we die.",
      "33": "Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”",
      "34": "Be sober-minded [be sensible, wake up from your spiritual stupor] as you ought, and stop sinning; for some [of you] have no knowledge of God [you are disgracefully ignorant of Him, and ignore His truths]. I say this to your shame.",
      "35": "But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?”",
      "36": "You fool! Every time you plant seed you sow something that does not come to life [germinating, springing up and growing] unless it first dies.",
      "37": "The seed you sow is not the body (the plant) which it is going to become, but it is a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.",
      "38": "But God gives it a body just as He planned, and to each kind of seed a body of its own [is given].",
      "39": "All flesh is not the same. There is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.",
      "40": "There are also heavenly bodies [sun, moon and stars] and earthly bodies [humans, animals, and plants], but the glory and beauty of the heavenly is one kind, and the glory of the earthly is another.",
      "41": "There is a glory and beauty of the sun, another glory of the moon, and yet another [distinctive] glory of the stars; and one star differs from another in glory and brilliance.",
      "42": "So it is with the resurrection of the dead. The [human] body that is sown is perishable and mortal, it is raised imperishable and immortal.",
      "43": "It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in strength;",
      "44": "it is sown a natural body [mortal, suited to earth], it is raised a spiritual body [immortal, suited to heaven]. As surely as there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.",
      "45": "So it is written [in Scripture], “The first man, Adam, became a living soul (an individual);” the last Adam (Christ) became a life-giving spirit [restoring the dead to life].",
      "46": "However, the spiritual [the immortal life] is not first, but the physical [the mortal life]; then the spiritual.",
      "47": "The first man [Adam] is from the earth, earthy [made of dust]; the second Man [Christ, the Lord] is from heaven.",
      "48": "As is the earthly man [the man of dust], so are those who are of earth; and as is the heavenly [Man], so are those who are of heaven.",
      "49": "Just as we have borne the image of the earthly [the man of dust], we will also bear the image of the heavenly [the Man of heaven].",
      "50": "Now I say this, believers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit nor be part of the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable (mortal) inherit the imperishable (immortal).",
      "51": "Listen very carefully, I tell you a mystery [a secret truth decreed by God and previously hidden, but now revealed]; we will not all sleep [in death], but we will all be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed],",
      "52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at [the sound of] the last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead [who believed in Christ] will be raised imperishable, and we will be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed].",
      "53": "For this perishable [part of us] must put on the imperishable [nature], and this mortal [part of us that is capable of dying] must put on immortality [which is freedom from death].",
      "54": "And when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says, “Death is swallowed up in victory (vanquished forever).",
      "55": "O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?”",
      "56": "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin [by which it brings death] is the law;",
      "57": "but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory [as conquerors] through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "58": "Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord [always doing your best and doing more than is needed], being continually aware that your labor [even to the point of exhaustion] in the Lord is not futile nor wasted [it is never without purpose]."
