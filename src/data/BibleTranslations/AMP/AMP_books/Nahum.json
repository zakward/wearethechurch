  "Nahum": {
    "1": {
      "1": "The oracle (a burdensome message—a pronouncement from God) concerning Nineveh [the capital city of Assyria]. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh [which he saw in spirit and prophesied].",
      "2": "The Lord is a jealous and avenging God [protecting and demanding what is rightfully and uniquely His];\nThe Lord avenges and He is full of wrath.\nThe Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries,\nAnd He reserves wrath for His enemies.",
      "3": "The Lord is slow to anger and great in power\nAnd He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.\nThe Lord has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm,\nAnd the clouds are the dust beneath His feet.",
      "4": "He rebukes the sea and dries it up;\nHe dries up all the rivers [illustrating His judgment].\nBashan [on the east] and [Mount] Carmel [on the west] wither,\nAnd [in the north] the blossoms of Lebanon fade.",
      "5": "The mountains quake before Him\nAnd the hills melt away;\nIndeed the earth is shaken by His presence—\nYes, the world and all that dwell in it.",
      "6": "Who can stand before His indignation [His great wrath]?\nAnd who can stand up and endure the fierceness of His anger?\nHis wrath is poured out like fire\nAnd the rocks are destroyed by Him.",
      "7": "The Lord is good,\nA strength and stronghold in the day of trouble;\nHe knows [He recognizes, cares for, and understands fully] those who take refuge and trust in Him.",
      "8": "But with an overwhelming flood [of judgment through invading armies]\nHe will make a complete destruction of its site\nAnd will pursue His enemies into darkness.",
      "9": "Whatever [plot] you [Assyrians] devise against the Lord,\nHe will make a complete end of it;\nAffliction [of God’s people by the hand of Assyria] will not occur twice.",
      "10": "Like tangled thorn branches [gathered for fuel],\nAnd like those drowned in drunkenness,\nThe people of Nineveh are consumed [through fire]\nLike stubble completely withered and dry [in the day of the Lord’s wrath].",
      "11": "From you [O Nineveh],\nOne has gone forth who plotted evil against the Lord,\nA malevolent counselor [the king of Assyria].",
      "12": "This is what the Lord says,\n“Though they are at full strength and many in number,\nEven so, they will be cut off and pass away.\nThough I have afflicted you and caused you grief [O Jerusalem],\nI will afflict you no longer.",
      "13": "“Now, I will break his yoke [of taxation] off you,\nAnd I will tear off your shackles.”",
      "14": "The Lord has given a command concerning you [O king of Nineveh]:\n“Your name will no longer be perpetuated.\nI will cut off the carved idols and cast images\nFrom the temple of your gods;\nI will prepare your grave,\nFor you are vile and unworthy.”",
      "15": "Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news [telling of Assyria’s destruction],\nWho announces peace and prosperity!\nCelebrate your feasts, O Judah;\nPerform your vows.\nFor the wicked one [the king of Assyria] will never again pass through you;\nHe is completely cut off."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "The one who scatters has come up against you [Nineveh].\nMan the fortress and ramparts, watch the road;\nStrengthen your back [prepare for battle], summon all your strength.",
      "2": "For the Lord will restore the splendor and majesty of Jacob\nLike the splendor of [ancient and united] Israel,\nEven though destroyers have destroyed them\nAnd ruined their vine branches.",
      "3": "The shields of his soldiers [of Media and Babylon] are colored red;\nThe warriors are dressed in scarlet.\nThe chariots blaze with fire of [flashing] steel\nWhen he is prepared to march,\nAnd the cypress spears are brandished [for battle].",
      "4": "The chariots race madly in the streets;\nThey rush wildly in the broad plazas.\nTheir appearance is like torches;\nThey rush in various directions like forked lightning.",
      "5": "He remembers and summons his nobles;\nThey stumble in their march [terrified because of the attack].\nThey hurry to the city wall,\nAnd the mantelet is prepared and firmly set up.",
      "6": "The gates of the rivers [surrounding Nineveh] are opened\nAnd the palace [of sun-dried brick] is dissolved [by the torrents].",
      "7": "It is decreed:\nNineveh is stripped, and she is carried away,\nAnd her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves,\nBeating on their breasts [in sorrow].",
      "8": "Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,\nNow her inhabitants are fleeing;\n“Stop! Stop!” [a few cry,]\nBut no one turns back.",
      "9": "Plunder the silver!\nPlunder the gold!\nFor there is no end to the treasure—\nWealth from every precious object.",

      "11": "Where is the den of the lions (Assyria)\nAnd the feeding place of the young lions,\nWhere the lion, lioness, and lion’s cub prowled\nWith nothing to fear?",
      "12": "The lion [of Assyria] tore enough for his cubs (Assyrian citizens),\nKilled [enough prey] for his lionesses,\nAnd filled his lairs with prey\nAnd his dens with torn flesh.",
      "13": "“Behold, I am against you [Nineveh],” declares the Lord of hosts, “and I will burn your chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the land, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Woe (judgment is coming) to the city of blood [guilty of murder and mayhem], completely full of lies and pillage;\nHer prey never departs [alive].",
      "2": "The noise of the [cracking of the] whip,\nThe noise of the rattling of the wheel,\nGalloping horses\nAnd rumbling and bounding chariots [in the assault of Nineveh]!",
      "3": "Horsemen charging,\nSwords flashing, spears gleaming,\nMany slain, a mass of corpses,\nNo end of corpses—\nThe horsemen stumble over the corpses!",
      "4": "All because of the many acts of prostitution of [Nineveh] the prostitute,\nThe charming and well-favored one, the mistress of sorceries,\nWho betrays nations by her acts of prostitution (idolatry)\nAnd families by her sorceries.",
      "5": "“Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of hosts,\n“And I will lift up your skirts over your face,\nAnd I will let the nations look at your nakedness [O Nineveh]\nAnd the kingdoms at your disgrace.",
      "6": "“I will throw filth on you\nAnd make you vile and treat you with contempt,\nAnd set you up as a spectacle.",
      "7": "“And it will come about that all who see you\nWill shrink back and run from you and say,\n‘Nineveh is completely ruined!\nWho will grieve for her?’\nWhere will I seek comforters for you?”",
      "8": "Are you better than Thebes,\nWhich was situated by the waters of the Nile,\nWith water surrounding her,\nWhose defense was the sea (the Nile),\nWhose wall consisted of the sea?",
      "9": "Ethiopia was her strength,\nAnd Egypt too, without limits.\nPut and Lubim were among her helpers.",
      "10": "Yet she became an exile;\nShe went into captivity.\nHer young children were dashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for her honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound with chains.",
      "11": "You too [Nineveh] will become drunk [with the cup of God’s wrath];\nYou will be hidden.\nYou too [Nineveh] will search [in vain] for a refuge from the enemy.",
      "12": "All your fortresses are [nothing but] fig trees with ripe figs—\nWhen shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.",
      "13": "Behold, your people are [as weak and helpless as] women in your midst!\nThe gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;\nFire consumes the bars across your gates.",
      "14": "Draw water for a [long, continued] siege!\nStrengthen your fortresses!\nGo down to the clay pits, trample the mortar!\nPrepare the brick kiln [to burn bricks for the rampart]!",
      "15": "But there [in the very midst of these preparations] the fire will devour you;\nThe sword will cut you down;\nIt will devour you as the locust does.\nMultiply yourself like the creeping locusts;\nMultiply yourself like the swarming locusts.",
      "16": "You have increased your traders more than the [visible] stars of heaven—\nThe creeping locust strips and destroys and then flies away.",
      "17": "Your guardsmen are like the swarming locusts.\nYour marshals are like the hordes of grasshoppers\nSettling in the stone walls on a cold day.\nWhen the sun rises, they fly away,\nAnd no one knows the place where they are.",
      "18": "Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria;\nYour nobles are lying down [in death].\nYour people are scattered on the mountains\nAnd there is no one to gather them.",
      "19": "There is no relief and healing for your hurt;\nYour wound is incurable.\nAll who hear the news about you\nClap their hands over [what has happened to] you.\nFor on whom has your [unceasing] evil not come continually?"
