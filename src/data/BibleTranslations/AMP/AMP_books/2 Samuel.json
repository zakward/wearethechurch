      "1": "Now it happened after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that he stayed two days in Ziklag.",
      "2": "On the third day a man came [unexpectedly] from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head [as in mourning]. When he came to David, he bowed to the ground and lay himself face down [in an act of great respect and submission].",
      "3": "Then David asked him, “Where do you come from?” He said, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”",
      "4": "David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.” He answered, “The people have fled from the battle. Also, many of the people have fallen and are dead; Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.”",
      "5": "So David said to the young man who informed him, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "And the young man who told him explained, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen [of the Philistines] were close behind him.",
      "7": "When he turned to look behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’",
      "8": "He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "He said to me, ‘Stand up facing me and kill me, for [terrible] agony has come over me, yet I still live [and I will be taken alive].’",
      "10": "So I stood facing him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the band which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”",
      "11": "Then David grasped his own clothes and tore them [in mourning]; so did all the men who were with him.",
      "12": "They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan his son, and for the Lord’s people and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword [in battle].",
      "13": "David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner (resident alien, sojourner), an Amalekite.”",
      "14": "David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”",
      "15": "David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” So he struck the Amalekite and he died.",
      "16": "David said to the [fallen] man, “Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the Lord’s anointed.’”",
      "17": "Then David sang this dirge (funeral song) over Saul and his son Jonathan,",

      "2": "So David went up there [to Hebron] with his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel [in Judah].",
      "3": "And David brought up his men who were with him, each one with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron.",

      "11": "And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.",

      "13": "Joab [David’s nephew] the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, with one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side of the pool.",
      "14": "Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now stand and have a contest before us.” And Joab said, “Let them stand.”",

      "16": "Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponents side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim [that is, the Field of Sides], which is in Gibeon.",
      "17": "There was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.",
      "18": "Three sons of Zeruiah [the half sister of David] were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as light and swift-footed as one of the [wild] gazelles in the field.",
      "19": "Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left as he followed him.",
      "20": "Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.”",
      "21": "So Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or to your left, and grab one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn away from pursuing Abner.",
      "22": "Abner repeated again, “Turn away from following me. Why should I have to strike you to the ground? How would I be able to face Joab your brother [and look him in the eye]?”",
      "23": "But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner struck him in the abdomen with the butt end of his spear, and the spear came out his back; and he fell there and died on that spot. And it came about that everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell and died, stood still [and reflected].",
      "24": "But Joab and Abishai [Asahel’s brothers] pursued Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "And the sons of [the tribe of] Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one troop, and took their stand on the top of a hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long [will it be] before you tell the people to stop pursuing their brothers?”",
      "27": "Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people certainly would have stopped pursuing their brothers in the morning.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.",
      "29": "Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah (desert region) all that night, crossed the Jordan, went through Bithron and walked the whole morning and came to Mahanaim [where Ish-bosheth ruled Israel].",
      "30": "Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel.",
      "31": "But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men; so that three hundred and sixty men died.",

      "6": "Now while war continued between the houses of Saul and David, Abner was proving himself strong in the house of Saul.",
      "7": "Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”",
      "8": "Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, “Am I a dog’s head [a despicable traitor] that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty and kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and his friends, by not having you handed over to David; and yet you charge me today with guilt concerning this woman.",

      "11": "And Ish-bosheth could not say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.",
      "12": "Then Abner sent messengers to David [who was] in his place [at Hebron], saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant (treaty) with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.”",
      "13": "David said, “Good! I will make a covenant (treaty) with you, but I require one thing of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.”",

      "15": "So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish [to whom Saul had given her].",
      "16": "But her husband went with her, weeping continually behind her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner told him, “Go, return.” And he did so.",
      "17": "Abner talked with the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you.",
      "18": "Now then, do it [and make him king]! For the Lord has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’”",
      "19": "Abner also spoke to [the men of] Benjamin. Then he also went to tell David at Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and to the entire house of Benjamin.",
      "20": "So Abner came to David at Hebron, and [brought] twenty men along with him. And David prepared a feast for Abner and the men with him.",
      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me stand up and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant (treaty) with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",
      "22": "Then the servants of David came with Joab from a raid and brought a great quantity of spoil with them; but Abner was not with David at Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”",
      "24": "Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why did you send him away, so that he is already gone?",
      "25": "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he [only] came to deceive you [with flattering words] and to learn of your going out and coming in, and to find out what you are doing.”",
      "26": "When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew nothing [about Joab’s action].",
      "27": "So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak to him privately, and there he struck Abner in the abdomen so that he died, to avenge the blood of Asahel, Joab’s brother.",
      "28": "Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.",
      "29": "Let the guilt fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house (family); and may there never disappear from the house of Joab one who suffers with a discharge or one who is a leper or one who walks with a crutch [being unfit for war], or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks food.”",
      "30": "So Joab and Abishai his brother murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.",
      "31": "Then David said to Joab and to all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier.",
      "32": "They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.",
      "33": "And the king sang a dirge (funeral song) over Abner and said,\n“Should Abner [the great warrior] die as a fool dies?",
      "34": "“Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters;\nAs a man falls before the wicked, so you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept again over him.",
      "35": "All the people came to urge David to eat food while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets.”",
      "36": "And all the people took notice of it and it pleased them, just as everything that the king did pleased all the people.",
      "37": "So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.",
      "38": "Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?",
      "39": "Today I am weak, though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer [Joab] in accordance with his wickedness!”"

And the boy’s nurse picked him up and fled; but it happened that while she was hurrying to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.",
      "5": "So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, left and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest.",

      "7": "Now when they entered the house he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They [not only] struck and killed him, [but] they also beheaded him. Then they took his head and traveled all night by way of the Arabah.",
      "8": "They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Look, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the Lord has granted my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his descendants.”",
      "9": "David replied to Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from every adversity,",
      "10": "when a man told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he was bringing good news, I seized and killed him in Ziklag, to reward him for his news.",
      "11": "How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous and just man in his own house on his bed, shall I not require his blood from your hand and remove you from the earth?”",
      "12": "So David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Hebron in the tomb of Abner [his relative]."

      "25": "But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be a burden to you.” Although Absalom [strongly] urged David, still he would not go, but he gave him his blessing.",
      "26": "Then Absalom said, “If not, then at least let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”",
      "27": "But Absalom urged him [again], and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.",
      "28": "Now Absalom commanded his servants, “Notice carefully, when Amnon’s heart is joyous with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not be afraid; have I not commanded you myself [and in doing so have I not taken full responsibility for his death]? Be courageous and brave.”",
      "29": "So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons got up, and every man mounted his mule and fled.",
      "30": "Now it happened while they were on the way [back home], that the [exaggerated] report came to David, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.”",
      "31": "Then the king stood and tore his clothes and lay on the ground [in mourning]; and all his servants were standing by with their clothes torn.",
      "32": "But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Do not let my lord assume that all the king’s sons have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead. This act of revenge has been on Absalom’s mind since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar.",
      "33": "So now, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”",
      "34": "Now Absalom fled. And the young man who kept watch looked up, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.",
      "35": "And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming. It has turned out just as your servant said.”",
      "36": "And when he finished speaking, the king’s sons came, and they raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.",
      "37": "But Absalom fled and went to [his mother’s father] Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.",
      "38": "So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there for three years.",
      "39": "And the heart of King David longed to go to Absalom; for he was comforted regarding Amnon, since he was dead."

    "14": {
      "1": "Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.",
      "2": "So Joab sent word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there and told her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning clothes, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has for many days been in mourning for the dead.",
      "3": "Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab told her what to say.",
      "4": "When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she bowed with her face to the ground and lay herself down, and said, “Help, O king.”",
      "5": "The king asked her, “What is the matter?” She said, “Truly I am a widow; my husband is dead.",
      "6": "Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled and fought in the field. There was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him.",
      "7": "Now behold, the entire family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who killed his brother, so that we may put him to death [to pay] for the life of his brother whom he killed and destroy the heir also.’ By doing this they will extinguish my coal that is left, leaving my husband without a name or a remnant (heir) on the face of the earth.”",
      "8": "Then David said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will give orders concerning you.”",
      "9": "The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the guilt is on me and on my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.”",
      "10": "The king said, “If anyone speaks to you [about this matter], bring him to me [for judgment], and he will not touch you again.”",
      "11": "Then she said, “Please let the king remember the Lord your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And David said, “As the Lord lives, not a single hair [from the head] of your son shall fall to the ground.”",
      "12": "Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak one more word to my lord the king.” He said, “Speak.”",
      "13": "The woman said, “Now why have you planned such a thing against God’s people? For in speaking this word the king is like a guilty man, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.",
      "14": "For we will certainly die and are like water that is spilled on the ground and cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not [simply] take away life, but devises plans so that the one who is banished is not driven away from Him.",
      "15": "Now I came to speak of this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. So your maidservant thought, ‘I will just speak to the king; perhaps the king will do what his maidservant requests.",
      "16": "For the king will hear and save his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’",
      "17": "Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for my lord the king is as the angel of God to discern good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.’”",
      "18": "Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.”",
      "19": "The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” And the woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me; he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant.",
      "20": "In order to change the appearance of things [between Absalom and you, his father] your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.”",
      "21": "Then the king said to Joab, “Listen, I will most certainly do this thing; now go, bring back the young man Absalom.”",
      "22": "Joab bowed his face toward the ground and lay himself down and blessed the king. Then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has done the request of his servant.”",
      "23": "So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "However, the king said, “Let him go to his own house, and do not let him see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the king’s face.",
      "25": "Now in all Israel there was no man as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised [for that]; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.",
      "26": "When he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of each year he cut it, because its weight was heavy on him) he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king’s weight.",
      "27": "To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.",
      "28": "Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without seeing the king’s face.",
      "29": "So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him; even when he sent again a second time, he [still] would not come.",
      "30": "Therefore Absalom said to his servants, “See, Joab’s property is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.",
      "31": "Then Joab took action and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”",
      "32": "Absalom answered Joab, “I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come [back] from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there.”’ Now then, let me see the king’s face, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.”",
      "33": "So Joab came to the king and told him. Then David called for Absalom, and he came to the king and bowed his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."

      "1": "After this, Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men as runners before him.",
      "2": "He would get up early and stand beside the road to the gate [of the city, where court was held]; and when any man who had a dispute came to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”",
      "3": "Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man appointed as the king’s agent to listen to you.”",
      "4": "Moreover Absalom would say, “Oh, that I were appointed judge in the land! Then every man who had a dispute could come to me and I would get justice for him.”",
      "5": "And whenever a man approached to bow down before him, he would put out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.",
      "6": "This is how Absalom dealt with everyone in Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.",
      "7": "And after four years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the Lord at Hebron [my birthplace].",
      "8": "For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram (Syria), ‘If the Lord will in fact bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord [by offering a sacrifice of thanksgiving].’”",
      "9": "And [David] the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.",
      "10": "But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’”",
      "11": "Then two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited [as guests to his sacrificial feast] went with Absalom. They went innocently and knew nothing [about his plan against David].",
      "12": "And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom increased continually.",
      "13": "Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”",
      "14": "David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, let us flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom! Go in haste, or he will overtake us quickly and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”",
      "15": "The king’s servants said to him, “Listen, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.”",
      "16": "So the king left, and all his household with him. But the king left behind ten women who were concubines to take care of the house (palace).",
      "17": "The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house.",
      "18": "All of David’s servants passed on beside him, and all the Cherethites, Pelethites and the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king.",
      "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us, too? Go back and stay with the king [of your own country], for you are a foreigner and an exile as well; return to your own place.",
      "20": "You came only yesterday, so should I make you wander with us today while I go where I will? Return and take your brothers back with you also. May lovingkindness and faithfulness be with you.”",

      "26": "But if He should say, ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me what seems good to Him.”",

      "33": "The king was deeply moved and went to the upper room over the gate and wept [in sorrow]. And this is what he said as he walked: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! How I wish that I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”"

      "4": "But the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”",
      "5": "Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have put all your servants to shame who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and concubines.",
      "6": "For you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have shown today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I know that if Absalom had lived and all the rest of us had died today, then you would be pleased.",

      "35": "I am this day eighty years old. Can I [be useful to advise you to] discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?",
      "36": "Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward?",
      "37": "Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city [and be buried] by the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham [my son]; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.”",

      "41": "And all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, “Why have our brothers (relatives), the men [from the tribe] of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him over the Jordan [instead of waiting for us to arrive]?”",
      "42": "Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. So why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense? Or has anything been taken for us?”",
      "43": "Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten [tribes’] shares in the king, and we have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt and ignore us [by rushing ahead]?

      "21": "That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand [in rebellion] against King David. Only hand him over, and I will leave the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.”",
      "22": "Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people [to inform them of the agreement]. And they beheaded Sheba the son of Bichri and threw his head [down] to Joab.
