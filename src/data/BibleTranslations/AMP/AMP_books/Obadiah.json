  "Obadiah": {
    "1": {
      "1": "The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom—\nWe have heard a report from the Lord,\nAnd an ambassador has been sent among the nations, saying,\n“Arise, and let us rise up against Edom for battle [with the Lord as commander]!”",
      "2": "“Behold [Edom], I shall [humiliate you and] make you small among the nations;\nYou are greatly despised.",
      "3": "“The pride and arrogance of your heart have deceived you,\nYou who live in the clefts and lofty security of the rock (Sela),\nWhose dwelling place is high,\nWho say [boastfully] in your heart,\n‘Who will bring me down to earth?’",
      "4": "“Though you build [your nest] on high like the eagle,\nThough you set your nest among the stars,\nI will bring you down from there,” says the Lord.",
      "5": "“If thieves came to you,\nIf robbers by night—\nHow you will be ruined!—\nWould they not steal only until they had enough?\nIf grape gatherers came to you,\nWould they not leave some grapes for gleaning?",
      "6": "“How Esau (Edom) shall be ransacked [by men who come to ravage with divine approval]!\nHow his hidden treasures shall be searched out!",
      "7": "“All the men allied with you\nShall send you on your way to the border;\nThe men who were at peace with you\nShall deceive you and overpower you;\nThose who eat your bread [those you trust]\nShall set a hostile ambush for you.\n(There is no understanding of it.)",
      "8": "“Will I not on that day,” says the Lord,\n“Destroy the wise men from Edom [removing all wisdom]\nAnd understanding from the mountain of Esau?",
      "9": "“And your mighty men shall be dismayed and demoralized, O Teman,\nSo that everyone from the mountain of Esau may be cut off in the slaughter.",
      "10": "“Because of the violence you did against your brother Jacob,\nShame shall cover you [completely],\nAnd you shall be cut off forever.",
      "11": "“On the day that [Jerusalem was destroyed] you stood aloof [from your brother Jacob]—\nOn the day that strangers took his forces captive and carried off his wealth,\nAnd foreigners entered his gates\nAnd cast lots for Jerusalem [dividing the city for plunder]—\nYou too were like one of them [collaborating with the enemy].",
      "12": "“Do not gaze and gloat [in triumph] over your brother’s day,\nThe day when his misfortune came.\nDo not rejoice over the sons of Judah\nIn the day of their destruction;\nDo not speak arrogantly [jeering and maliciously mocking]\nIn the day of their distress.",
      "13": "“Do not enter the gate of My people\nIn the day of their disaster;\nYes, you, do not look [with delight] on their misery\nIn the day of their ruin,\nAnd do not loot treasures\nIn the day of their ruin.",
      "14": "“Do not stand at the crossroad\nTo cut down those [of Judah] who escaped;\nAnd do not hand over [to the enemy] those [of Judah] who survive\nIn the day of their distress.",
      "15": "“For the [judgment] day of the Lord draws near on all the nations.\nAs you have done, it shall be done to you [in retribution];\nYour [evil] dealings will return on your own head.",
      "16": "“Because just as you [Edom] drank on My holy mountain [desecrating it in the revelry of the destroyers],\nSo shall all the nations drink continually [one by one, of My wrath];\nYes, they shall drink and swallow [the full measure of punishment]\nAnd become as though they had never existed.",
      "17": "“But on Mount Zion [in Jerusalem] there shall be [deliverance for] those who escape,\nAnd it shall be holy [no pagan will defile it];\nAnd the house of Jacob shall possess their [former] possessions.",
      "18": "“Then the house of Jacob shall be a fire\nAnd the house of Joseph a flame [in executing God’s wrath];\nBut the house of Esau will be like stubble.\nThey (Jacob) shall set them on fire and consume them (the Edomites),\nSo that there shall be no survivor of the house of Esau,”\nFor the Lord has spoken.",
      "19": "Then those of the Negev shall possess the mountain of Esau,\nAnd those of the Shephelah [shall possess] the Philistine plain;\nAlso, [they shall] possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria,\nAnd Benjamin will possess Gilead [across the Jordan River].",
      "20": "And the exiles of this host of the sons (descendants) of Israel\nWho are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,\nAnd the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\nShall possess the cities of the Negev.",
      "21": "The deliverers shall go up on Mount Zion\nTo rule and judge the mountain of Esau,\nAnd the kingdom and the kingship shall be the Lord’s."
