  "Mark": {
    "1": {
      "1": "The beginning of the [facts regarding the] good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
      "2": "As it is written and forever remains in the [writings of the] prophet Isaiah:\n“Behold, I send My messenger ahead of You,\nWho will prepare Your way—",
      "3": "A voice of one shouting in the wilderness,\n‘Prepare the way of the Lord,\nMake His paths straight!’”",
      "4": "John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins [that is, requiring a change of one’s old way of thinking, turning away from sin and seeking God and His righteousness].",
      "5": "And all the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem were continually going out to him; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.",
      "6": "John wore clothing made of camel’s hair and had a [wide] leather band around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "And he was preaching, saying, “After me comes He who is mightier [more powerful, more noble] than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the straps of His sandals [even as His slave].",
      "8": "As for me, I baptized you [who came to me] with water [only]; but He will baptize you [who truly repent] with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "Immediately coming up out of the water, he (John) saw the heavens torn open, and the Spirit like a dove descending on Him (Jesus);",
      "11": "and a voice came out of heaven saying: “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased and delighted!”",
      "12": "Immediately the [Holy] Spirit forced Him out into the wilderness.",
      "13": "He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted [to do evil] by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered continually to Him.",
      "14": "Now after John [the Baptist] was arrested and taken into custody, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of [the kingdom of] God,",
      "15": "and saying, “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves repentance; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”",
      "16": "As Jesus was walking by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon [Peter] and Simon’s brother, Andrew, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.",
      "17": "And Jesus said to them, “Follow Me [as My disciples, accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk], and I will make you fishers of men.”",
      "18": "Immediately they left their nets and followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].",
      "19": "Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending and cleaning the nets.",
      "20": "Immediately Jesus called to them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and went away to follow Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].",
      "21": "They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
      "22": "They were completely amazed at His teaching; because He was teaching them as one having [God-given] authority, and not as the scribes.",
      "23": "Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out [terribly from the depths of his throat],",
      "24": "saying, “What business do You have with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet (muzzled, silenced), and come out of him!”",
      "26": "The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions, and screeching with a loud voice, came out of him.",
      "27": "They were all so amazed that they debated and questioned each other, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits (demons), and they obey Him.”",
      "28": "Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere throughout the district surrounding Galilee.",
      "29": "And immediately they left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [Peter] and Andrew, accompanied by James and John.",
      "30": "Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they told Him about her.",
      "31": "Jesus went to her, and taking her by the hand, raised her up; and the fever left her, and she began to serve them [as her guests].",
      "32": "Now when evening came, after the sun had set [and the Sabbath Day had ended, in a steady stream] they were bringing to Him all who were sick and those who were under the power of demons,",
      "33": "until the whole city had gathered together at the door.",
      "34": "And Jesus healed many who were suffering with various diseases; and He drove out many demons, but would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him [recognizing Him as the Son of God].",
      "35": "Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left [the house], and went out to a secluded place, and was praying there.",
      "36": "Simon [Peter] and his companions searched [everywhere, looking anxiously] for Him,",
      "37": "and they found Him and said, “Everybody is looking for You!”",
      "38": "He replied, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so I may preach there also; that is why I came [from the Father].”",
      "39": "So He went throughout Galilee, preaching [the gospel] in their synagogues and casting out demons.",
      "40": "And a leper came to Him, begging Him and falling on his knees before Him, saying, “If You are willing, You are able to make me clean.”",
      "41": "Moved with compassion [for his suffering], Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be cleansed.”",
      "42": "The leprosy left him immediately and he was cleansed [completely healed and restored to health].",
      "43": "And Jesus [deeply moved] admonished him sternly and sent him away immediately,",
      "44": "saying to him, “See that you tell no one anything [about this]; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, as proof to them [that you are really healed].”",
      "45": "But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news [of his healing], to such an extent that Jesus could no longer openly enter a city [where He was known], but stayed out in the unpopulated places; yet people were still coming to Him from everywhere."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Jesus returned to Capernaum, and a few days later the news went out that He was at home.",
      "2": "So many people gathered together that there was no longer room [for them], not even near the door; and Jesus was discussing with them the word [of God].",
      "3": "Then they came, bringing to Him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four men.",
      "4": "When they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus; and when they had dug out an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their [active] faith [springing from confidence in Him], He said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "But some of the scribes were sitting there debating in their hearts [the implication of what He had said],",
      "7": "“Why does this man talk that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins [remove guilt, nullify sin’s penalty, and assign righteousness] except God alone?”",
      "8": "Immediately Jesus, being fully aware [of their hostility] and knowing in His spirit that they were thinking this, said to them, “Why are you debating and arguing about these things in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’; or to say, ‘Get up, and pick up your mat and walk’?",
      "10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has the authority and power on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralyzed man,",
      "11": "“I say to you, get up, pick up your mat and go home.”",
      "12": "And he got up and immediately picked up the mat and went out before them all, so that they all were astonished and they glorified and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
      "13": "Jesus went out again along the [Galilean] seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.",
      "14": "As He was passing by, He saw Levi (Matthew) the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax collector’s booth, and He said to him, “Follow Me [as My disciple, accepting Me as your Master and Teacher and walking the same path of life that I walk].” And he got up and followed Him [becoming His disciple, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].",
      "15": "And it happened that Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners [including non-observant Jews] were eating with Him and His disciples; for there were many of them and they were following Him.",
      "16": "When the scribes [belonging to the sect] of the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the sinners [including non-observant Jews] and tax collectors, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard this, He said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but [only] those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners [who recognize their sin and humbly seek forgiveness].”",
      "18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting [as a ritual]; and they came and asked Jesus, “Why are John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting, but Your disciples are not doing so?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered, “The attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is [still] with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the days will come when the bridegroom is [forcefully] taken away from them, and they will fast at that time.",
      "21": "“No one sews a patch of unshrunk (new) cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse.",
      "22": "No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the [fermenting] wine will [expand and] burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the wineskins. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.”",
      "23": "One Sabbath He was walking along [with His disciples] through the grainfields, and as they went along, His disciples began picking the heads of grain.",
      "24": "The Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”",
      "25": "Jesus said to them, “Have you never read [in the Scriptures] what David did when he was in need and was hungry, he and his companions;",
      "26": "how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and how he also gave it to the men who were with him?”",
      "27": "Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath [and He has authority over it].”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Again Jesus went into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was withered.",
      "2": "The Pharisees were watching Jesus closely to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him [in the Jewish high court].",
      "3": "He said to the man whose hand was withered, “Get up and come forward!”",
      "4": "He asked them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent.",
      "5": "After looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness and arrogance of their hearts, He told the man, “Hold out your hand.” And he held it out, and his hand was [completely] restored.",
      "6": "Then the Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians [to plot] against Him, as to how they might [fabricate some legal grounds to] put Him to death.",
      "7": "Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large crowd from Galilee followed Him; and also people from Judea,",
      "8": "and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from the region] beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon; a vast number of people came to Him because they were hearing about all [the things] that He was doing.",
      "9": "And He told His disciples to have a small boat stand ready for Him because of the many people, so that they would not crowd Him;",
      "10": "for He had healed many, and as a result all who had diseases pressed around Him to touch Him.",
      "11": "Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and screamed out, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "Jesus sternly warned them [again and again] not to tell who He was.",
      "13": "He went up on the hillside and called those whom He Himself wanted and chose; and they came to Him.",
      "14": "And He appointed twelve [disciples], so that they would be with Him [for instruction] and so that He could send them out to preach [the gospel as apostles—that is, as His special messengers, personally chosen representatives],",
      "15": "and to have authority and power to cast out demons.",
      "16": "He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),",
      "17": "and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”);",
      "18": "and [He also appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew (Nathanael), and Matthew (Levi the tax collector), and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus (Judas the son of James), and Simon the Zealot;",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.",
      "20": "Then He came to a house [in Capernaum], and a crowd formed again, so [many people] that Jesus and His disciples could not even eat a meal [together].",
      "21": "When His own family heard this they went to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He is out of His mind.”",
      "22": "The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul (Satan),” and “He is driving out the demons by the [power of the] ruler of the demons.”",
      "23": "So He called them to Himself and spoke to them in parables, “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided [split into factions and rebelling] against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.",
      "26": "And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.",
      "27": "But no one can go into a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers and ties up the strong man, and then he will ransack and rob his house.",
      "28": "“I assure you and most solemnly say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and all the abusive and blasphemous things they say;",
      "29": "but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit and His power [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an everlasting sin [a sin which is unforgivable in this present age as well as in the age to come]”—",
      "30": "[Jesus said this] because the scribes and Pharisees were [attributing His miracles to Satan by] saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "Then His mother and His brothers arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him and called for Him.",
      "32": "A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Look! Your mother and Your brothers are outside asking for You.”",
      "33": "And He replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”",
      "34": "Looking at those who were sitting in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!",
      "35": "For whoever does the will of God [by believing in Me, and following Me], he is My brother and sister and mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Again Jesus began to teach beside the sea [of Galilee]. And a very large crowd gathered around Him, so He got into a boat [anchoring it a short distance out] on the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the shore.",
      "2": "And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them,",
      "3": "“Listen! A sower went out to sow seed;",
      "4": "and as he was sowing, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and ate it up.",
      "5": "Other seed fell on rocks where there was not much soil; and immediately a plant sprang up because the soil had no depth.",
      "6": "And when the sun came up, the plant was scorched; and because it had no root, it dried up and withered away.",
      "7": "Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.",
      "8": "And other seed fell into good soil, and as the plants grew and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundred times [as much as had been sown].”",
      "9": "And He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear and heed My words.”",
      "10": "As soon as He was alone, those who were around Him, together with the twelve [disciples], began asking Him about [the interpretation of] the parables.",
      "11": "He said to them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you [who have teachable hearts], but those who are outside [the unbelievers, the spiritually blind] get everything in parables,",
      "12": "so that they will continually look but not see, and they will continually hear but not understand, otherwise they might turn [from their rejection of the truth] and be forgiven.”",
      "13": "Then He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand and grasp the meaning of all the parables?",
      "14": "The sower sows the word [of God, the good news regarding the way of salvation].",
      "15": "These [in the first group] are the ones along the road where the word is sown; but when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.",
      "16": "In a similar way these [in the second group] are the ones on whom seed was sown on rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy [but accept it only superficially];",
      "17": "and they have no real root in themselves, so they endure only for a little while; then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they [are offended and displeased at being associated with Me and] stumble and fall away.",
      "18": "And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,",
      "19": "but the worries and cares of the world [the distractions of this age with its worldly pleasures], and the deceitfulness [and the false security or glamour] of wealth [or fame], and the passionate desires for all the other things creep in and choke out the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
      "20": "And those [in the last group] are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word [of God, the good news regarding the way of salvation] and accept it and bear fruit—thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much [as was sown].”",
      "21": "He said to them, “A lamp is not brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not [brought in] to be put on the lampstand?",
      "22": "For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been kept secret, but that it would come to light [that is, things are hidden only temporarily, until the appropriate time comes for them to be known].",
      "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear and heed My words.”",
      "24": "Then He said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear. By your own standard of measurement [that is, to the extent that you study spiritual truth and apply godly wisdom] it will be measured to you [and you will be given even greater ability to respond]—and more will be given to you besides.",
      "25": "For whoever has [a teachable heart], to him more [understanding] will be given; and whoever does not have [a yearning for truth], even what he has will be taken away from him.”",
      "26": "Then He said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who throws seed on the ground;",
      "27": "and he goes to bed at night and gets up every day, and [in the meantime] the seed sprouts and grows; how [it does this], he does not know.",
      "28": "The earth produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head [of grain], then the mature grain in the head.",
      "29": "But when the crop ripens, he immediately puts in the sickle [to reap], because [the time for] the harvest has come.”",
      "30": "And He said, “How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it?",
      "31": "It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the ground, even though it is smaller than all the [other] seeds that are [sown] on the soil,",
      "32": "yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs; and it puts out large branches, so that the birds of the sky are able to make nests and live under its shade.”",
      "33": "With many such parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear and understand it;",
      "34": "and He did not say anything to them without [using] a parable; He did, however, explain everything privately to His own disciples.",
      "35": "On that [same] day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go over to the other side [of the Sea of Galilee].”",
      "36": "So leaving the crowd, they took Him with them, just as He was, in the boat. And other boats were with Him.",
      "37": "And a fierce windstorm began to blow, and waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was already being swamped.",
      "38": "But Jesus was in the stern, asleep [with His head] on the [sailor’s leather] cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are about to die?”",
      "39": "And He got up and [sternly] rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still (muzzled)!” And the wind died down [as if it had grown weary] and there was [at once] a great calm [a perfect peacefulness].",
      "40": "Jesus said to them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith and confidence [in Me]?”",
      "41": "They were filled with great fear, and said to each other, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.",
      "2": "When Jesus got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him,",
      "3": "and the man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with chains.",
      "4": "For he had often been bound with shackles [for the feet] and with chains, and he tore apart the chains and broke the shackles into pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue and tame him.",
      "5": "Night and day he was constantly screaming and shrieking among the tombs and on the mountains, and cutting himself with [sharp] stones.",
      "6": "Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him [in homage];",
      "7": "and screaming with a loud voice, he said, “What business do we have in common with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God [swear to me], do not torment me!”",
      "8": "For Jesus had been saying to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”",
      "9": "He was asking him, “What is your name?” And he replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”",
      "10": "And he began begging Him repeatedly not to send them out of the region.",
      "11": "Now there was a large herd of pigs grazing there on the mountain.",
      "12": "And the demons begged Him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may go into them!”",
      "13": "Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out [of the man] and entered the pigs. The herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea; and they were drowned [one after the other] in the sea.",
      "14": "The herdsmen [tending the pigs] ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And the people came to see what had happened.",
      "15": "They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had [previously] had the “legion” [of demons]; and they were frightened.",
      "16": "Those who had seen it described [in detail] to the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and [told them all] about the pigs.",
      "17": "So the people began to beg with Jesus to leave their region.",
      "18": "As He was stepping into the boat, the [Gentile] man who had been demon-possessed was begging with Him [asking] that he might go with Him [as a disciple].",
      "19": "Jesus did not let him [come], but [instead] He said to him, “Go home to your family and tell them all the great things that the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.”",
      "20": "So he [obeyed and] went away and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [the region of the ten Hellenistic cities] all the great things that Jesus had done for him; and all the people were astonished.",
      "21": "When Jesus had again crossed over in the boat to the other side [of the sea], a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore.",
      "22": "One of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up; and seeing Him, fell at His feet",
      "23": "and begged anxiously with Him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; [please] come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.”",
      "24": "And Jesus went with him; and a large crowd followed Him and pressed in around Him [from all sides].",
      "25": "A woman [in the crowd] had [suffered from] a hemorrhage for twelve years,",
      "26": "and had endured much [suffering] at the hands of many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but instead had become worse.",
      "27": "She had heard [reports] about Jesus, and she came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His outer robe.",
      "28": "For she thought, “If I just touch His clothing, I will get well.”",
      "29": "Immediately her flow of blood was dried up; and she felt in her body [and knew without any doubt] that she was healed of her suffering.",
      "30": "Immediately Jesus, recognizing in Himself that power had gone out from Him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched My clothes?”",
      "31": "His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in around You [from all sides], and You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’”",

      "4": "But there were some who were indignantly remarking to one another, “Why has this perfume been wasted?",
      "5": "For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii [a laborer’s wages for almost a year], and the money given to the poor.” And they scolded her.",
      "6": "But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why are you bothering her and causing trouble? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me.",

      "20": "And He replied, “It is one of the twelve [disciples], one who is dipping bread in the bowl with Me.",
      "21": "For the Son of Man goes [to the cross] just as it is written [in Scripture] of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”",
      "22": "While they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it [giving thanks and praise], and He broke it, and gave it to them and said, “Take it. This is My body.”",

      "33": "He took Peter and James and John with Him, and He began to be deeply distressed and troubled [extremely anguished at the prospect of what was to come].",
      "34": "And He said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved and overwhelmed with sorrow, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.”",
      "35": "After going a little farther, He fell to the ground [distressed by the weight of His spiritual burden] and began to pray that if it were possible [in the Father’s will], the hour [of suffering and death for the sins of mankind] might pass from Him.",
      "36": "He was saying, “Abba, Father! All things are possible for You; take this cup [of judgment] away from Me; but not what I will, but what You will.”",
      "37": "And He came back and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Were you unable to keep watch for one hour?",
      "38": "Keep [actively] watching and praying so that you do not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”",
      "39": "He went away again and prayed, saying the same words.",
      "40": "And again He came back and found them sleeping, because their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know how to answer Him.",
      "41": "He came back a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough [of that]! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.",

      "49": "Day after day I was with you, teaching in the [courts and porches of the] temple, and you did not seize Me; but this has happened so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.”",

      "51": "A young man was following Him, wearing [only] a linen sheet over his naked body; and some men seized him.",

      "54": "Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers [guards and servants] and warming himself at the fire.",
      "55": "Now the chief priests and the entire Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus [which they could use] to have Him [condemned and] executed, but they were not finding any.",

      "57": "Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him, saying,",

      "59": "Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.",
      "60": "The high priest stood up and came forward and asked Jesus, “Have You no answer to give [in response] to what these men are testifying against You?”",
      "61": "But Jesus kept silent and gave no answer at all. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, “Are You the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the Son of the Blessed One?”",
      "62": "Jesus said, “I am; and you will [all] see the Son of Man seated [with authority] at the right hand of Power (the Father), and coming with the clouds of heaven.”",
      "63": "Then tearing his robe [to express his indignation], the high priest said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?",
      "64": "You have heard the blasphemy [that is, His claim to be the Son of God]. What is your decision?” And they all condemned Him to be [guilty and] deserving of death.",
      "65": "And some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy [by telling us who hit you]!” Then the officers took custody of Him and struck him in the face.",
      "66": "While Peter was down below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came,",
      "67": "and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You were with Jesus the Nazarene, too.”",
      "68": "But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” Then he went out [of the courtyard] to the porch, [and a rooster crowed.]",
      "69": "The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to tell the bystanders, “This [man] is one of them.”",
      "70": "But again he denied it. After a little while, the bystanders again said to Peter, “You are in fact one of them, for [it is clear from your accent, that] you are a Galilean, too.”",
      "71": "But he began to invoke a curse [on himself] and to swear [an oath], “I do not know this man you are talking about!”",
      "72": "Immediately a rooster crowed the second time. And Peter remembered what Jesus said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And thinking of this, he began weeping [in anguish]."
