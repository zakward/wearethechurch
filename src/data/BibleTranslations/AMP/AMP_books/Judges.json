  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "Now it came about after the death of Joshua, that the sons (descendants) of Israel (Jacob) asked the Lord, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”",
      "2": "And the Lord said, “Judah shall go up [first]; behold, I have given the land into his hand.”",
      "3": "And [the tribe of the sons of] Judah said to [the tribe of the sons of] Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "Then Judah went up, and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they struck down in defeat ten thousand men at Bezek.",
      "5": "Then they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they struck down in defeat the Canaanites and the Perizzites.",
      "6": "But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather up scraps of food under my table; as I have done [to others], so God has repaid me.” So they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "Then the sons of Judah fought against [Jebusite] Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.",
      "9": "Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev (South country) and in the lowland.",
      "10": "So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.",
      "11": "From there [the tribe of] Judah went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher [city of books and scribes]).",
      "12": "And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah as a wife.”",
      "13": "Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.",
      "14": "When she came to Othniel, she persuaded him to [allow her to] ask her father [Caleb] for a field. Then she [rode up to Caleb and] dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”",
      "15": "She said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.",
      "16": "The sons of [Jethro] the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms (Jericho) with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the Negev (South country) near Arad; and they went and lived with the people.",
      "17": "Then [the warriors of the tribe of] Judah went with [the warriors of the tribe of] Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the city was called Hormah (destruction).",
      "18": "Also [the warriors of] Judah captured Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory.",
      "19": "The Lord was with Judah, and [the tribe of] Judah took possession of the hill country, but they could not dispossess and drive out those inhabiting the valley because they had iron chariots.",
      "20": "Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.",
      "22": "The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz).",
      "24": "The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly.”",
      "25": "So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free.",
      "26": "The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.",
      "27": "But [the tribe of] Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites remained in that land.",
      "28": "It happened when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.",
      "29": "Neither did [the warriors of] Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.",
      "30": "[The warriors of the tribe of] Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and were put to forced labor.",
      "31": "[The warriors of the tribe of] Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob.",
      "32": "So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.",
      "33": "Neither did [the warriors of] Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced labor for them.",
      "34": "Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan [back] into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down into the valley;",
      "35": "yet the Amorites persisted in living on Mount Heres (the mountain of the sun), in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house (descendants) of Joseph became strong and prevailed, they became forced labor.",
      "36": "The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela (rock) and upward."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Now the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you to the land which I swore [to give] to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,",
      "2": "and as for you, you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed Me; what is this that you have done?",
      "3": "So I also said, ‘I will not drive your enemies out before you; but they will be like thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.’”",
      "4": "When the Angel of the Lord had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people raised their voices and wept.",
      "5": "So they named that place Bochim (weepers); and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.",
      "6": "And when Joshua had sent the people away, the [tribes of the] Israelites went each to his inheritance, to take possession of the land.",
      "7": "The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord which He had done for Israel.",
      "8": "Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of a hundred and ten.",
      "9": "And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "Also, all [the people of] that generation were gathered to their fathers [in death]; and another generation arose after them who did not know (recognize, understand) the Lord, nor even the work which He had done for Israel.",
      "11": "Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord and worshiped and served the Baals,",
      "12": "and they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods from the gods of the peoples who were around them, and they bowed down to them, and offended and provoked the Lord to anger.",
      "13": "So they abandoned the Lord and served Baal [the pagan god of the Canaanites] and the Ashtaroth.",
      "14": "So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands (power) of plunderers who robbed them; and He sold them into the hands of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer stand [in opposition] before their enemies.",
      "15": "Wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil (misfortune), as the Lord had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.",
      "16": "Then the Lord raised up judges who rescued them from the hands of those who robbed them.",
      "17": "Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the prostitute after other gods and they bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do as their fathers.",
      "18": "When the Lord raised up judges for them, He was with the judge and He rescued them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.",
      "19": "But when the judge died, they turned back and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, in following and serving other gods, and bowing down to them. They did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways.",
      "20": "So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed (violated) My covenant (binding agreement) which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice,",
      "21": "I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left [to be conquered] when he died,",
      "22": "in order to test [the loyalty of] Israel by them, whether Israel will keep the way of the Lord to walk in it, as their fathers did, or not.”",
      "23": "So the Lord allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out at once; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now these are the nations which the Lord left [in order] to test Israel by them (that is, all [the people of Israel] who had not [previously] experienced any of the wars in Canaan;",
      "2": "only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, at least those who had not experienced it previously).",
      "3": "The remaining nations are: the five lords (governors) of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.",
      "4": "They were [allowed to remain] for the testing of Israel, to determine whether Israel would listen to and obey the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers (ancestors) through Moses.",
      "5": "And the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites;",
      "6": "and they took their daughters for themselves as wives and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their [pagan] gods.",
      "7": "And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth.",
      "8": "So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.",
      "9": "But when the Israelites cried out to the Lord [for help], the Lord raised up a man to rescue the people of Israel, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.",
      "10": "The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.",
      "11": "And the land was at rest [from oppression for] forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "Now the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, since they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord.",
      "13": "And Eglon gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and went and struck down Israel [in defeat], and they took possession of the City of Palm Trees (Jericho).",
      "14": "And the Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the Israelites cried out to the Lord [for help], the Lord raised up a man to rescue them, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the Israelites sent a gift of tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab.",
      "16": "Now Ehud made for himself a sword a cubit long, which had two edges, and he bound it on his right thigh under his robe.",
      "17": "And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.",
      "18": "And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried it.",
      "19": "But Ehud himself turned back from the sculptured stones at Gilgal, [and he returned to Eglon] and said [to him], “I have a secret message for you, O king.” Eglon said “Keep silence.” And all who attended him left him.",
      "20": "Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his [private] cool upper chamber, and Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And the king got up from his seat.",
      "21": "Then Ehud reached out with his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly.",
      "22": "And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, because Ehud did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out.",
      "23": "Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him, and locked them.",
      "24": "When Ehud departed, Eglon’s servants came. And when they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool room.”",
      "25": "They waited [a very long time] until they became embarrassed and uneasy, but he still did not open the doors of the upper room. So [finally] they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor, dead.",
      "26": "Now Ehud escaped while they lingered, and he passed beyond the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah.",
      "27": "When he had arrived, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them.",
      "28": "And he said to them, “Pursue them, for the Lord has handed over your enemies the Moabites to you.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab and did not allow anyone to cross.",
      "29": "They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong, courageous men; not a man escaped.",
      "30": "So Moab was subdued and humbled that day under the hand of Israel, and the land was at rest for eighty years.",
      "31": "After Ehud came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistine men with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "But the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the Lord, after Ehud died.",
      "2": "So the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.",
      "3": "Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord [for help], for Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots and had oppressed and tormented the sons of Israel severely for twenty years.",
      "4": "Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.",
      "5": "She used to sit [to hear and decide disputes] under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment.",
      "6": "Now she sent word and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, “Behold, the Lord, the God of Israel, has commanded, ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men [of war] from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.",
      "7": "I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his infantry to meet you at the river Kishon, and I will hand him over to you.’”",
      "8": "Then Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”",
      "9": "She said, “I will certainly go with you; nevertheless, the journey that you are about to take will not be for your honor and glory, because the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "And Barak summoned [the fighting men of the tribes of] Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up under his command; Deborah also went up with him.",
      "11": "Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the terebinth tree in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.",
      "12": "When someone told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
      "13": "Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.",
      "14": "Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day when the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Has the Lord not gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.",
      "15": "And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and [confused] all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled away on foot.",
      "16": "But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and the entire army of Sisera fell by the sword; not even one man was left.",
      "17": "But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me! Have no fear.” So he turned aside to her [and went] into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.",
      "19": "And he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink because I am thirsty.” And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him.",
      "20": "And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is there anyone here?’ tell him, ‘No.’”",
      "21": "But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand, and came up quietly to him and drove the peg through his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died.",
      "22": "And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he entered [her tent] with her, and behold Sisera lay dead with the tent peg in his temple.",
      "23": "So on that day God subdued and humbled Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.",
      "24": "And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed down heavier and heavier on Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed him."

      "4": "So when he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made of it an image [of silver-plated wood] and a cast image [of solid silver]; and they were in the house of Micah.",

      "2": "So the sons of Dan sent from the total number of their [extended] family five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.",
      "3": "When they passed near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?”",

      "15": "So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.",

      "18": "When these [five men] went into Micah’s house and took the [plated] image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”",
      "19": "They said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?”",
      "20": "The priest’s heart was glad [to hear that], and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the image, and went among the people.",

      "24": "He said, “You have taken away my gods which I have made, and the priest, and have gone away; what else do I have left? How can you say to me, ‘What is your reason?’”",
      "25": "The sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice [of complaint] be heard among us, or else angry men will assault you and you will lose your life, along with the lives of [everyone in] your household.”",

      "27": "They took the [idolatrous] things that Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.",
      "28": "And there was no one to rescue them because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it.",
