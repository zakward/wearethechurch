  "Philemon": {
    "1": {
      "1": "Paul, a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed), and our brother Timothy,\nTo Philemon our dearly beloved friend and fellow worker,",
      "2": "and to [your wife] Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier [in ministry], and to the church that meets in your house:",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,",
      "5": "because I hear of your love and of your faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints (God’s people).",
      "6": "I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective and powerful because of your accurate knowledge of every good thing which is ours in Christ.",
      "7": "For I have had great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints (God’s people) have been refreshed through you, my brother.",
      "8": "Therefore [on the basis of these facts], though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is appropriate,",
      "9": "yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul, an old man, and now also a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus—",
      "10": "I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child Onesimus, whom I have fathered [in the faith] while a captive in these chains.",
      "11": "Once he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you as well as to me.",
      "12": "I have sent him back to you in person, that is, like sending my very heart.",
      "13": "I would have chosen to keep him with me, so that he might minister to me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel;",
      "14": "but I did not want to do anything without first getting your consent, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.",
      "15": "Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, so that you would have him back forever,",
      "16": "no longer as a slave, but [as someone] more than a slave, as a brother [in Christ], especially dear to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer].",
      "17": "So if you consider me a partner, welcome and accept him as you would me.",
      "18": "But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;",
      "19": "I, Paul, write this with my own hand, I will repay it in full (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).",
      "20": "Yes, brother, let me have some benefit and joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
      "21": "I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance, since I know that you will do even more than I ask.",
      "22": "At the same time also prepare a guest room for me [in expectation of a visit], for I hope that through your prayers I will be [granted the gracious privilege of] coming to you [at Colossae].",
      "23": "Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus,",
      "24": "and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.",
      "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
