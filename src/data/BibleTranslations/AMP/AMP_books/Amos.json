      "5": "The Lord God of hosts [the Omnipotent Ruler],\nIt is He who touches the earth [in judgment] and it melts,\nAnd all who dwell on it mourn [in despair and fear],\nAnd all of it rises up like the Nile\nAnd subsides like the Nile of Egypt;",
      "6": "It is He who builds His upper chambers in the heavens\nAnd has established His vaulted dome (the firmament of heaven) over the earth,\nHe who calls to the waters of the sea\nAnd pours them out on the face of the earth—\nThe Lord is His name.",
      "7": "“Are you [degenerate ones] not as the [despised] sons of Ethiopia to Me,\nO sons of Israel?” says the Lord.\n“Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt,\nAnd the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans (Syrians) from Kir?",
      "8": "“Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful [northern] kingdom [of Israel’s ten tribes]\nAnd I shall destroy it from the face of the earth;\nBut I shall not totally destroy the house of Jacob [that is, the entire nation of Israel],”\nSays the Lord.",
      "9": "“For behold, I am commanding,\nAnd I shall shake and sift the house of Israel among all nations [and cause it to tremble]\nLike grain is shaken in a sieve [removing the chaff],\nBut not a kernel [of the faithful remnant] shall fall to the ground and be lost [from My sight].",
      "10": "“All the sinners among My people will die by the sword,\nThose who say [defiantly], ‘The disaster will not overtake or confront us.’",
      "11": "“In that day I shall raise up and restore the fallen tabernacle (booth) of David,\nAnd wall up its breaches [in the city walls];\nI will also raise up and restore its ruins\nAnd rebuild it as it was in the days of old,",
      "12": "That they may possess the remnant of Edom (ancient enemies)\nAnd all the nations that are called by My name,”\nSays the Lord who does this.",
      "13": "“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord,\n“When the plowman shall overtake the one who gathers the harvest,\nAnd the one who treads the grapes [shall overtake] him who sows the seed [for the harvest continues until planting time];\nWhen the mountains will drip sweet wine\nAnd all the hills shall melt [that is, everything that was once barren will overflow with streams of blessing].",
      "14": "“Also I shall bring back the exiles of My people Israel,\nAnd they will rebuild the deserted and ruined cities and inhabit them:\nThey will also plant vineyards and drink their wine,\nAnd make gardens and eat their fruit.",
      "15": "“I will also plant them on their land,\nAnd they shall never again be uprooted from their land\nWhich I have given them,”\nSays the Lord your God."
