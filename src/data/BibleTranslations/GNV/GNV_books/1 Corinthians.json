      "3": "Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God, which is given you in Jesus Christ.",
      "5": "That in all things ye are made rich in him in all kind of speech, and in all knowledge:",
      "6": "As the testimony of Jesus Christ hath been confirmed in you:",
      "7": "So that ye are not destitute of any gift: waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.",

      "9": "God is faithful, by whom ye are called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak one thing, and that there be no dissensions among you: but be ye knit together in one mind, and in one judgment.",
      "11": "For it hath been declared unto me, my brethren, of you by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.",
      "12": "Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am Paul’s, and I am Apollos’s, and I am Cephas’s and I am Christ’s.",

      "14": "I thank God, that I baptized none of you, but Crispus, and Gaius,",
      "15": "Lest any should say, that I had baptized into mine own name.",
      "16": "I baptized also the household of Stephanas: furthermore know I not, whether I baptized any other.",
      "17": "For CHRIST sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.",
      "18": "For that preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness: but unto us, which are saved, it is the power of God.",

      "20": "Where is the wise? where is the Scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made the wisdom of this world foolishness?",
      "21": "For seeing the world by wisdom knew not God in the wisdom of GOD, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe:",
      "22": "Seeing also that the Jews require a sign, and the Grecians seek after wisdom.",
      "23": "But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews, even a stumbling block, and unto the Grecians, foolishness:",
      "24": "But unto them which are called, both of the Jews and Grecians, we preach Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.",

      "26": "For brethren, you see your calling, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.",
      "27": "But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the mighty things,",
      "28": "And vile things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.",

      "4": "Neither stood my word, and my preaching in the enticing speech of man’s wisdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit and of power.",
      "5": "That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",
      "6": "And we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world, which come to nought.",
      "7": "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hid wisdom, which God had determined before the world, unto our glory.",
      "8": "Which none of the princes of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",

      "10": "But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",
      "11": "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man, which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have receiveth not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit, which is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us of God.",
      "13": "Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.",
      "14": "But the natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
      "15": "But he that is spiritual, discerneth all things: yet he himself is judged of no man.",

      "3": "For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?",
      "4": "For when one saith, I am Paul’s, and another, I am Apollos’s, are ye not carnal?",
      "5": "Who is Paul then? and who is Apollos, but the ministers by whom ye believed, and as the Lord gave to every man?",

      "8": "And he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one, and every man shall receive his wages, according to his labor.",
      "9": "For we together are God’s laborers: ye are God’s husbandry, and God’s building.",
      "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, as a skillful master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it.",
      "11": "For other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "And if any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, timber, hay, or stubble,",
      "13": "Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by the fire: and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.",
      "14": "If any man’s work, that he hath built upon, abide, he shall receive wages.",
      "15": "If any man’s work burn, he shall lose, but he shall be saved himself: nevertheless yet as it were by the fire.",
      "16": "Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",
      "17": "If any man destroy the Temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which ye are.",
      "18": "Let no man deceive himself: If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him be a fool, that he may be wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God: for it is written, He catcheth the wise in their own craftiness.",
      "20": "And again, The Lord knoweth that the thoughts of the wise be vain.",
      "21": "Therefore let no man rejoice in men: for all things are yours.",

      "4": "For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not thereby justified: but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.",
      "5": "Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hid in darkness, and make the counsels of the hearts manifest: and then shall every man have praise of God.",
      "6": "Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied unto mine own self and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye might learn by us, that no man presume above that which is written, that one swell not against another for any man’s cause.",
      "7": "For who separateth thee? and what hast thou, that thou hast not received? if thou hast received it, why rejoicest thou, as though thou hadst not received it?",
      "8": "Now ye are full: now ye are made rich: ye reign as kings without us, and would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.",
      "9": "For I think that God hath set forth us the last Apostles, as men appointed to death, for we are made a gassing stock unto the world, and to the Angels, and to men.",
      "10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, and ye are wise in Christ: we are weak, and ye are strong: ye are honorable, and we are despised.",

      "12": "And labor, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and yet we bless: we are persecuted, and suffer it.",
      "13": "We are evil spoken of, and we pray: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, unto this time.",

      "16": "Wherefore, I pray you, be followers of me.",
      "17": "For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, which is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, which shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church.",

      "19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and I will know, not the words of them which are puffed up, but the power.",

      "7": "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened: for Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.",
      "8": "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither in the leaven of maliciousness and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",

      "13": "And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, if he be content to dwell with her, let her not forsake him.",

      "34": "There is difference also between a virgin and a wife: the unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy, both in body and in spirit: but she that is married, careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
      "35": "And this I speak for your own commodity, not to tangle you in a snare, but that ye follow that which is honest, and that ye may cleave fast unto the Lord without separation.",

      "39": "The wife is bound by the law, as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry with whom she will, only in the Lord.",
