    "1": {
      "1": "After that Joshua was dead, the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites to fight first against them?",
      "2": "And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have given the land into his hand.",
      "3": "And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites: and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot: so Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "Then Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.",
      "5": "And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and slew the Canaanites, and the Perizzites.",
      "6": "But Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet.",
      "7": "And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy Kings having the thumbs of their hands and of their feet cut off, gathered bread under my table: as I have done, so God hath rewarded me, so they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.",
      "8": "(Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and hath taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and had set the city on fire.)",
      "9": "Afterward also the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and toward the South, and in the low country.",
      "10": "And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron, which Hebron beforetime was called Kirjath Arba: and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "And from thence he went to the inhabitants of Debir, and the name of Debir in old time was Kirjath Sepher.",
      "12": "And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath Sepher, and taketh it, even to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.",
      "13": "And Othniel the son of Kenaz Caleb’s younger brother took it, to whom he gave Achsah his daughter to wife.",
      "14": "And when she came to him, she moved him to ask of her father a field, and she lighted off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?",
      "15": "And she answered him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a South country, give me also Springs of water: and Caleb gave her the springs above, and the springs beneath.",
      "16": "And the children of Keni Moses’ father-in-law went up out of the city of the palm trees with the children of Judah, into the wilderness of Judah, that lieth in the South of Arad, and went and dwelt among the people.",
      "17": "But Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it, and called the name of the city Hormah.",
      "18": "Also Judah took Gaza with the coasts thereof, and Ashkelon with the coasts thereof, and Ekron with the coasts thereof.",
      "19": "And the Lord was with Judah, and he possessed the mountains: for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys, because they had chariots of iron.",
      "20": "And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had said, and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "But the children of Benjamin did not cast out the Jebusites, that inhabited Jerusalem: therefore the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.",
      "22": "They also that were of the house of Joseph, went up to Bethel, and the Lord was with them,",
      "23": "And the house of Joseph caused to view Bethel (and the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)",
      "24": "And the spies saw a man come out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the way into the city, and we will show thee mercy.",
      "25": "And when he had showed them the way into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his household depart.",
      "26": "Then the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.",
      "27": "Neither did Manasseh destroy Beth Shean with her towns, nor Taanach with her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor with her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam with her towns, neither the inhabitants of Megiddo with her towns: but the Canaanites dwelled still in that land.",
      "28": "Nevertheless when Israel was strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute, and expelled them not wholly.",
      "29": "Likewise Ephraim expelled not the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.",
      "30": "Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.",
      "31": "Neither did Asher cast out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,",
      "32": "But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.",
      "33": "Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, and of Beth Anath became tributaries unto them.",
      "34": "And the Amorites drove the children of Dan into the mountain: so that they suffered them not to come down to the valley.",
      "35": "And the Amorites dwelt still in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and when the hand of Joseph’s family prevailed, they became tributaries:",
      "36": "And the coast of the Amorites was from Maaleh-Akrabbim, even from Sela and upward."

      "1": "And an Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I had sworn unto your fathers, and said, I will never break my covenant with you.",
      "2": "Ye also shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land, but shall break down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice. Why have ye done this?",
      "3": "Wherefore, I said also, I will not cast them out before you, but they shall be as thorns unto your sides, and their gods shall be your destruction.",
      "4": "And when the Angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice, and wept.",
      "5": "Therefore they called the name of that place, Bochim, and offered sacrifices there unto the Lord.",
      "6": "Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man into his inheritance, to possess the land.",
      "7": "And the people had served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the Elders that outlived Joshua, which had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel.",
      "8": "But Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died, when he was an hundred and ten years old:",
      "9": "And they buried him in the coasts of his inheritance, in Timnath Heres in mount Ephraim, on the North side of mount Gaash.",
      "10": "And so all that generation was gathered unto their fathers, and another generation arose after them, which neither knew the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "Then the children of Israel did wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and served Baal,",
      "12": "And forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods, even the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger.",
      "13": "So they forsook the Lord, and served Baal, and Ashtoreth.",
      "14": "And the wrath of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers, that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.",
      "15": "Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was sore against them, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: so he punished them sore.",
      "16": "Notwithstanding, the Lord raised up Judges, which delivered them out of the hands of their oppressors.",
      "17": "But yet they would not obey their Judges for they went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them, and turned quickly out of the way, wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the Lord: they did not so.",
      "18": "And when the Lord had raised them up Judges, the Lord was with the Judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the Judge (for the Lord had compassion of their groanings, because of them that oppressed them and tormented them.)",
      "19": "Yet when the Judge was dead, they returned, and did worse than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and worship them: they ceased not from their own inventions, nor from their rebellious way.",
      "20": "Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said, Because this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and hath not obeyed my voice,",
      "21": "Therefore will I no more cast out before them any of the nations, which Joshua left when he died,",
      "22": "That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.",
      "23": "So the Lord left those nations, and drove them not out immediately, neither delivered them into the hand of Joshua."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "These now are the nations which the Lord left, that he might prove Israel by them (even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan,",
      "2": "Only to make the generations of the children of Israel to know, and to teach them war, which doubtless their predecessors knew not.)",
      "3": "Five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal Hermon until one come to Hamath.",
      "4": "And these remained to prove Israel by them, to wit, whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.",
      "5": "And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,",
      "6": "And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.",
      "7": "So the children of Israel did wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served Baal, and Asherah.",
      "8": "Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim King of Aram-naharaim, and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.",
      "9": "And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord stirred up a Savior to the children of Israel, and he saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.",
      "10": "And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Cushan-Rishathaim.",
      "11": "So the land had rest forty years, and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "Then the children of Israel again committed wickedness in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had committed wickedness before the Lord.",
      "13": "And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.",
      "14": "So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord stirred them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera the son of Jemini, a man lame of his right hand: and the children of Israel sent a present by him unto Eglon king of Moab.",
      "16": "And Ehud made him a dagger with two edges of a cubit length, and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh,",
      "17": "And he presented the gift unto Eglon king of Moab (and Eglon was a very fat man.)",
      "18": "And when he had now presented the present, he sent away the people that bare the present,",
      "19": "But he turned again from the quarries, that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O King. Who said, Keep silence: and all that stood about him went out from him.",
      "20": "Then Ehud came unto him, (and he sat alone in a summer parlor, which he had) and Ehud said, I have a message unto thee from God. Then he arose out of his throne.",
      "21": "And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly,",
      "22": "So that the haft went in after the blade, and the fat closed about the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, but the dirt came out.",
      "23": "Then Ehud got him out into the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.",
      "24": "And when he was gone out, his servants came: who seeing that the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he doeth his easement in his summer chamber.",
      "25": "And they tarried till they were ashamed: and seeing he opened not the doors of the parlor, they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen dead on the earth.",
      "26": "So Ehud escaped (while they tarried) and was past the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah,",
      "27": "And when he came home, he blew a trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he went before them.",
      "28": "Then said he unto them, Follow me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies, even Moab into your hand. So they went down after him, and took the passages of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.",
      "29": "And they slew of the Moabites the same time about ten thousand men, all fed men, and all were warriors, and there escaped not a man.",
      "30": "So Moab was subdued that day, under the hand of Israel: and the land had rest fourscore years.",
      "31": "And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad, and he also delivered Israel."

    "4": {
      "1": "And the children of Israel began again to do wickedly in the sight of the Lord when Ehud was dead.",
      "2": "And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin King of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor, whose chief captain was called Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.",
      "3": "Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: (for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and twenty years he had vexed the children of Israel very sore.)",
      "4": "And at that time Deborah a Prophetess the wife of Lapidoth judged Israel.",
      "5": "And this Deborah dwelt under a palm tree, between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.",
      "6": "Then she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh of Naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go, and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?",
      "7": "And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army with his chariots, and his multitude, and will deliver him into thine hand.",
      "8": "And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.",
      "9": "Then she answered, I will surely go with thee, but this journey that thou takest, shall not be for thine honor: for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up on his feet with ten thousand men, and Deborah went up with him.",
      "11": "(Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, was departed from the Kenites, and pitched his tent until the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.)",
      "12": "Then they showed Sisera, that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.",
      "13": "And Sisera called for all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.",
      "14": "Then Deborah said unto Barak, Up: for this is the day that the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand. Is not the Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.",
      "15": "And the Lord destroyed Sisera and all his chariots, and all his host with the edge of the sword before Barak, so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.",
      "16": "But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword: there was not a man left.",
      "17": "Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: (for peace was between Jabin the king of Hazor, and between the house of Heber the Kenite.)",
      "18": "And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn into me: fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into her tent, she covered him with a mantel.",
      "19": "And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink: for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.",
      "20": "Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and when any man doth come and inquire of thee, saying, Is any man there? thou shalt say, Nay.",
      "21": "Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground, (for he was fast asleep and weary) and so he died.",
      "22": "And behold, as Barak pursued after Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man, whom thou seekest: and when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail in his temples.",
      "23": "So God brought down Jabin the king of Canaan that day before the children of Israel.",
      "24": "And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."

      "4": "Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou departedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens rained, the clouds also dropped water.",
      "5": "The mountains melted before the Lord, as did that Sinai before the Lord God of Israel.",
      "6": "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of  Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.",

      "15": "And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar, and also Barak: he was set on his feet in the valley: for the divisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart.",
      "16": "Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? for the divisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart.",
      "17": "Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why doth Dan remain in ships? Asher sat on the seashore, and tarried in his decayed places.",
      "18": "But the people of Zebulun and Naphtali have jeopardized their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.",
      "19": "The Kings came and fought: then fought the Kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they received no gain of money.",

      "30": "Have they not gotten, and they divide the spoil? every man hath a maid or two. Sisera hath a prey of diverse colored garments, a prey of sundry colors made of needle work: of diverse colors of needle work on both sides, for the chief of the spoil.",
