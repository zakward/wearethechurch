      "4": "One generation passeth, and another generation succeedeth: but the earth remaineth forever.",
      "5": "The sun riseth, and the sun goeth down, and draweth to his place where he riseth.",
      "6": "The wind goeth toward the South, and compasseth toward the North: the wind goeth round about, and returneth by his circuits.",
      "7": "All the rivers go into the sea, yet the sea is not full: for the rivers go unto the place whence they return, and go.",
      "8": "All things are full of labor: man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.",
      "9": "What is it that hath been? that that shall be: and what is it that hath been done? that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there anything, whereof one may say, Behold this, it is new? it hath been already in the old time that was before us.",

      "14": "I have considered all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity, and vexation of the spirit.",
      "15": "That which is crooked, can none make straight: and that which faileth, cannot be numbered.",
      "16": "I thought in mine heart, and said, Behold, I am become great, and excel in wisdom all them that have been before me in Jerusalem: and mine heart hath seen much wisdom and knowledge.",
      "17": "And I gave mine heart to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and foolishness: I knew also that this is a vexation of the spirit.",
      "18": "For in the multitude of wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow."

      "3": "I sought in mine heart to give myself to wine, and to lead mine heart in wisdom, and to take hold of folly, till I might see where is that goodness of the children of men, which they enjoy under the Sun, the whole number of the days of their life.",
      "4": "I have made my great works: I have built me houses: I have planted me vineyards.",
      "5": "I have made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruit.",

      "7": "I have gotten servants and maids, and had children born in the house: also I had great Possession of beeves and sheep above all that were before me in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "I have gathered unto me also silver and gold, and the chief treasures of Kings and provinces: I have provided me men singers, and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as a woman taken captive, and women taken captives.",
      "9": "And I was great, and increased above all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.",
      "10": "And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I withheld it not from them: I withdrew not mine heart from any joy: for mine heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my travail.",
      "11": "Then I looked on all my works that mine hands had wrought, and on the travail that I had labored to do: and behold, all is vanity and vexation of the spirit: and there is no profit under the Sun.",
      "12": "And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: (for who is the man that will come after the King in things, which men now have done?)",
      "13": "Then I saw that there is profit in wisdom more than in folly: as the light is more excellent than darkness.",
      "14": "For the wise manâ€™s eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness: yet I know also that the same condition falleth to them all.",
      "15": "Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth unto me, as it befalleth to the fool. Why therefore do I then labor to be more wise? And I said in mine heart, that this also is vanity.",
      "16": "For there shall be no remembrance of the wise, nor of the fool forever: for that that now is, in the days to come, shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man, as doth the fool?",
      "17": "Therefore I hated life: for the work that is wrought under the Sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity, and vexation of the spirit.",
      "18": "I hated also all my labor, wherein I had travailed under the Sun, which I shall leave to the man that shall be after me.",
      "19": "And who knoweth whether he shall be wise or foolish? yet shall he have rule over all my labor, wherein I have travailed, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the Sun. This is also vanity.",
      "20": "Therefore I went about to make mine heart abhor all the labor, wherein I had travailed under the Sun.",
      "21": "For there is a man whose travail is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity: yet to a man that hath not travailed herein, shall he give his portion: this also is vanity, and a great grief.",
      "22": "For what hath man of all his travail and grief of his heart, wherein he hath travailed under the Sun?",
      "23": "For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanity.",
      "24": "There is no profit to man, but that he eat and drink, and delight his soul with the profit of his labor: I saw also this, that it was of the hand of God.",
      "25": "For who could eat, and who could haste to outward things more than I?",
      "26": "Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth pain to gather, and to heap to give to him that is good before God: this also is vanity, and vexation of the spirit."

      "14": "I know that whatsoever God shall do, it shall be forever: to it can no man add, and from it can none diminish: for God hath done it, that they should fear before him.",
      "15": "What is that that hath been? that is now: and that that shall be, hath now been: for God requireth that which is past.",
      "16": "And moreover, I have seen under the Sun the place of judgment, where was wickedness, and the place of justice, where was iniquity.",
      "17": "I thought in mine heart, God will judge the just and the wicked: for time is there for every purpose and for every work.",
      "18": "I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men, that God had purged them: yet to see too, they are in themselves as beasts.",
      "19": "For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beasts are even as one condition unto them. As the one dieth, so dieth the other: for they have all one breath, and there is no excellency of man above the beast: for all is vanity.",
      "20": "All go to one place, and all was of the dust, and all shall return to the dust.",
      "21": "Who knoweth whether the spirit of man ascend upward, and the spirit of the beast descend downward to the earth?",
      "22": "Therefore I see that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his affairs, because that is his portion. For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?"

      "3": "And I count him better than them both, which hath not yet been: for he hath not seen the evil works which are wrought under the sun.",
      "4": "Also I beheld all travail, and all perfection of works, that this is the envy of a man against his neighbor: this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.",

      "6": "Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and vexation of spirit.",

      "8": "There is one alone, and there is not a second, which hath neither son nor brother, yet is there none end of all his travail, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither doth he think, For whom do I travail and defraud my soul of pleasures? this also is vanity, this is an evil travail.",
      "9": "Two are better wages for their labor.",
      "10": "For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe unto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him up.",
      "11": "Also if two sleep together, then shall they have heat: but to one how should there be heat?",
      "12": "And if one overcome him, two shall stand against him: and a threefold cord is not easily broken.",
      "13": "Better is a poor and wise child, than an old and foolish King, which will no more be admonished.",
      "14": "For out of the prison he cometh forth to reign: when as he that is born in his kingdom, is made poor.",

      "3": "When thou hast vowed a vow to God, defer not to pay it: for he delighteth not in fools: pay therefore that thou hast vowed.",
      "4": "It is better that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay it.",
