      "3": "Who being the brightness of the glory, and the engraved form of his person, and bearing up all things by his mighty word: hath by himself purged our sins: and sitteth at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places,",
      "4": "And is made so much more excellent than the Angels, inasmuch as he hath obtained a more excellent Name than they.",
      "5": "For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee? and again, I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son:",
      "6": "And again, when he bringeth in his first begotten Son into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him.",
      "7": "And of the Angels he saith, He maketh the spirits his messengers, and his ministers a flame of fire.",
      "8": "But unto the Son he saith, O God, thy throne is forever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of righteousness.",
      "9": "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy fellows.",
      "10": "And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast established the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.",
      "11": "They shall perish, but thou dost remain, and they all shall wax old as doth a garment,",
      "12": "And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.",
      "13": "Unto which also of the Angels said he at any time, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?",
      "14": "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister, for their sakes which shall be heirs of salvation?"

      "3": "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be preached by the Lord, and afterward was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.",
      "4": "God bearing witness thereto, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghost, according to his own will?",
      "5": "For he hath not put in subjection unto the Angels the world to come, whereof we speak.",
      "6": "But one in a certain place witnessed, saying, What is man, that thou shouldest be mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou wouldest consider him?",
      "7": "Thou madest him a little inferior to the Angels: thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and hast set him above the works of thine hands.",
      "8": "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. And in that he hath put all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that should not be subject unto him. But we yet see not all things subdued unto him,",
      "9": "But we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor, which was made little inferior to the Angels, through the suffering of death, that by God’s grace he might taste death for all men.",
      "10": "For it became him, for whom are all these things, and by whom are all these things, seeing that he brought many children unto glory, that he should consecrate the Prince of their salvation through afflictions.",
      "11": "For he that sanctifieth, and they which are sanctified, are all of one: wherefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren,",
      "12": "Saying, I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the Church will I sing praises to thee.",
      "13": "And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, here am I, and the children which God hath given me.",

      "15": "And that he might deliver all them, which for fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.",

      "17": "Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be merciful, and a faithful high Priest in things concerning God, that he might make reconciliation for the sins of the people.",

      "3": "For this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he which hath builded the house, hath more honor than the house.",
      "4": "For every house is builded of some man, and he that hath built all things, is God.",
      "5": "Now Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a witness of the things which should be spoken after.",
      "6": "But Christ is as the Son, over his own house, whose house we are, if we hold fast that confidence and that rejoicing of that hope unto the end.",

      "8": "Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of the temptation in the wilderness,",
      "9": "Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years long.",

      "13": "But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.",

      "15": "So long as it is said, Today if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.",
      "16": "For some when they heard, provoked him to anger: howbeit, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.",
      "17": "But with whom was he displeased forty years? Was he not displeased with them that sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?",
      "18": "And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but unto them that obeyed not?",

      "3": "For we which have believed, do enter into rest, as he said to the other, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.",
      "4": "For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.",
      "5": "And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.",
      "6": "Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter thereinto, and they to whom it was first preached, entered not therein for unbelief’s sake:",
      "7": "Again he appointed in David a certain day, by Today, after so long a time, saying, as it is said, This day, if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts.",

      "9": "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.",
      "10": "For he that is entered into his rest, hath also ceased from his own works, as God did from his.",
      "11": "Let us study therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of disobedience.",
      "12": "For the word of God is lively, and mighty in operation, and sharper than any two edged sword, and entereth through, even unto the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints, and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts, and the intents of the heart.",
      "13": "Neither is there any creature, which is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and open unto his eyes, with whom we have to do.",
      "14": "Seeing then that we have a great high Priest, which is entered into heaven, even Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.",
      "15": "For we have not an high Priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sin.",
      "16": "Let us therefore go boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."

      "4": "And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.",
      "5": "So likewise Christ took not to himself this honor to be made the high Priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my son, this day begat I thee, gave it him.",
      "6": "As he also in another place speaketh, Thou art a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,",
      "7": "Who in the days of his flesh did offer up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears unto him, that was able to save him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared.",
      "8": "And though he were the Son, yet learned he obedience, by the things which he suffered.",
      "9": "And being consecrated, was made the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him:",
      "10": "And is called of God an high Priest after the order of Melchizedek.",
      "11": "Of whom we have many things to say, which are hard to be uttered, because ye are dull of hearing.",
      "12": "For when as concerning the time ye ought to be teachers, yet have ye need again that we teach you what are the first principles of the word of God: and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.",
      "13": "For everyone that useth milk, is inexpert in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.",
      "14": "But strong meat belongeth to them that are of age, which through long custom have their wits exercised, to discern both good and evil."

      "3": "And this will we do if God permit.",
      "4": "For it is impossible that they which were once lightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost,",
      "5": "And have tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come,",
      "6": "If they fall away, should be renewed again by repentance: seeing they crucify again to themselves the Son of God, and make a mock of him.",
      "7": "For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing of God.",
      "8": "But that which beareth thorns and briars, is reproved, and is near unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.",
      "9": "But beloved, we have persuaded ourselves better things of you, and such as accompany salvation, though we thus speak.",
      "10": "For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work, and labor of love, which ye showed toward his Name, in that ye have ministered unto the Saints, and yet minister.",
      "11": "And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto the end,",
      "12": "That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, which through faith and patience, inherit the promises.",
      "13": "For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he had no greater to swear by, he swore by himself,",
      "14": "Saying, Surely I will abundantly bless thee, and multiply thee marvelously.",
      "15": "And so after that he had tarried patiently, he enjoyed the promise.",
      "16": "For men verily swear by him that is greater than themselves, and an oath for confirmation is among them an end of all strife.",
      "17": "So God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the stableness of his counsel, bound himself by an oath,",
      "18": "That by two immutable things, wherein it is impossible that God should lie, we might have strong consolation, which have our refuge to lay hold upon that hope that is set before us,",
      "19": "Which hope we have, as an anchor of the soul, but sure and steadfast, and it entereth into that which is within the veil.",

      "3": "Without father, without mother, without kindred, and hath neither beginning of his days, neither end of life: but is likened unto the Son of God, and continueth a Priest forever.",
      "4": "Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave the tithe of the spoils.",

      "6": "But he whose kindred is not counted among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.",

      "11": "If therefore perfection had been by the Priesthood of the Levites (for under it the Law was established to the people) what needed it furthermore, that another Priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not to be called after the order of Aaron?",
      "12": "For if the Priesthood be changed, then of necessity must there be a change of the Law.",
      "13": "For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth unto another tribe, whereof no man served at the altar.",
      "14": "For it is evident, that our Lord sprung out of Judah, concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the Priesthood.",
      "15": "And it is yet a more evident thing, because that after the similitude of Melchizedek, there is risen up another Priest,",
      "16": "Which is not made Priest after the Law of the carnal commandment, but after the power of the endless life.",
      "17": "For he testifieth thus, Thou art a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.",

      "27": "Which needeth not daily as those high Priests to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peoples: for that did he once, when he offered up himself.",

      "3": "For every high Priest is ordained to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it was of necessity, that this man should have somewhat also to offer.",
      "4": "For he were not a Priest, if he were on the earth, seeing there are Priests that according to the Law offer gifts,",

      "18": "Wherefore, neither was the first ordained without blood.",

      "23": "It was then necessary, that the similitudes of heavenly things should be purified with such things: but the heavenly things themselves are purified with better sacrifices than are these.",
