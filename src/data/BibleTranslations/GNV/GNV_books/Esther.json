      "3": "In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants, even the power of Persia and Media, and to the captains and governors of the provinces which were before him,",
      "4": "That he might show the riches and glory of his kingdom, and the honor of his great majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.",
      "5": "And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were found in the palace of Shushan, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace,",

      "14": "And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan the seven Princes of Persia, and Media, which saw the King’s face, and sat the first in the kingdom.)",

      "16": "Then Memucan answered before the king and the Princes, The Queen Vashti hath not only done evil against the King, but against all the Princes, and against all the people that are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.",
      "17": "For the act of the Queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their own eyes, and shall say, The King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the Queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.",
      "18": "So shall the Princesses of Persia and Media this day say unto all the King’s Princes, when they hear of the act of the Queen: thus shall there be much despitefulness and wrath.",

      "6": "Which had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity that was carried away with Jeconiah King of Judah (whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel had carried away.)",
      "7": "And he nourished Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful to look on: and after the death of her father, and her mother, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.",
      "8": "And when the king’s commandment, and his decree was published, and many maids were brought together to the palace of Shushan, under the hand of Hegai, Esther was brought also unto the King’s house under the hand of Hegai the keeper of the women.",
      "9": "And the maid pleased him, and she found favor in his sight, therefore he caused her things for purification to be given her speedily, and her state, and seven comely maids to be given her out of the King’s house, and he gave change to her and to her maids of the best in the house of the women.",
      "10": "But Esther showed not her people and her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not tell it.",
      "11": "And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know if Esther did well, and what should be done with her.",
      "12": "And when the course of every maid came, to go in to King Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and in the purifying of the women:",
      "13": "And thus went the maids unto the King) whatsoever she required, was given her to go with her out of the women’s house unto the king’s house.",
      "14": "In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women under the hand of Shaashgaz the King’s eunuch, which kept the concubines: she came in to the King no more, except she pleased the King, and that she were called by name.",
      "15": "Now when the course of Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (which had taken her as his own daughter) came, that she should go in to the king, she desired nothing, but what Hege the king’s eunuch the keeper of the women said: and Esther found favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.",
      "16": "So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.",
      "17": "And the King loved Esther above all the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins: so that he set the crown of the kingdom upon her head, and made her Queen instead of Vashti.",
      "18": "Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes, and his servants, which was the feast of Esther, and gave rest unto the provinces, and gifts, according to the power of a king.",
      "19": "And when the virgins were gathered the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.",
      "20": "Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did after the word of Mordecai, as when she was nourished with him.",
      "21": "In those days when Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the King Ahasuerus.",
      "22": "And the thing was known to Mordecai, and he told it unto Queen Esther, and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name: and when inquisition was made, it was found so: therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the Chronicles before the king."

      "5": "And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not the knee unto him, nor did reverence unto him, then Haman was full of wrath.",
      "6": "Now he thought it too little to lay hands only on Mordecai: and because they had showed him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.",
      "7": "In the first month (that is the month Nisan) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is a lot) before Haman, from day to day, and from month to month unto the twelfth month, that is the month Adar.",
      "8": "Then Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a people scattered, and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are divers from all people, and they do not observe the King’s laws: therefore it is not the king’s profit to suffer them.",
      "9": "If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver by the hands of them that have the charge of this business to bring it into the king’s treasury.",
      "10": "Then the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the Jews’ adversary.",
      "11": "And the king said unto Haman, Let the silver be thine, and the people to do with them as it pleaseth thee.",

      "14": "The contents of the writing was, that there should be given a commandment in all provinces, and published unto all people, that they should be ready against the same day.",

Now I have not been called to come unto the king these thirty days.",
