      "4": "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and make thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.",
      "5": "Came thieves to thee or robbers by night? how wast thou brought to silence? would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?",

      "7": "All the men of thy confederacy have driven thee to the borders: the men that were at peace with thee, have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee: they that eat thy bread, have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.",

      "12": "But thou shouldest not have beholden the day of thy brother, in the day that he was made a stranger, neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah, in the day of their destruction: thou shouldest not have spoken proudly in the day of affliction.",
      "13": "Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their destruction, neither shouldest thou have once looked on their affliction in the day of their destruction, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their destruction.",
      "14": "Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossways to cut off them, that should escape, neither shouldest thou have shut up the remnant thereof in the day of affliction.",
