      "3": "So they sought for a fair young maid throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found one Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "And the maid was exceedingly fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.",
      "5": "Then Adonijah the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he got him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.",
      "6": "And his father would not displease him from his childhood, to say, Why hast thou done so? And he was a very goodly man, and his mother bare him next after Absalom.",
      "7": "And he took counsel of Joab the son of Zeruiah, and of Abiathar the Priest: and they helped forward Adonijah.",

      "10": "But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother he called not.",
      "11": "Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?",
      "12": "Now therefore come, and I will now give thee counsel, how to save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go, and get thee in unto King David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O King, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why is then Adonijah King?",
      "14": "Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the King, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.",
      "15": "So Bathsheba went in unto the King into the chamber, and the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the King.",
      "16": "And Bathsheba bowed and made obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What is thy matter?",
      "17": "And she answered him, My lord, thou swearest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.",

      "21": "For else when my lord the King shall sleep with his fathers, I and my son Solomon shall be reputed vile.",
      "22": "And lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan also the Prophet came in.",
      "23": "And they told the King, saying, Behold, Nathan the Prophet. And when he was come in to the King, he made obeisance before the king upon his face to the ground.",
      "24": "And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?",
      "25": "For he is gone down this day, and hath slain many oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the Priest: and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.",

      "27": "Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?",
      "28": "Then king David answered, and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the King.",

      "30": "That as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place, so will I certainly do this day.",
      "31": "Then Bathsheba bowed her face to the earth, and did reverence unto the king, and said, God save my lord king David forever.",
      "32": "And king David said, Call me Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the King.",
      "33": "Then the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and carry him down to Gihon.",
      "34": "And let Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet anoint him there king over Israel, and blow ye the trumpet, and say, God save King Solomon.",
      "35": "Then come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne: and he shall be King in my stead: for I have appointed him to be prince over Israel, and over Judah.",
      "36": "Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, So be it, and the Lord God of my lord the king ratify it.",
      "37": "As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and exalt his throne above the throne of my lord king David.",
      "38": "So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.",
      "39": "And Zadok the Priest took an horn of oil out of the Tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, God save king Solomon.",
      "40": "And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rang with the sound of them.",
      "41": "And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him, heard it: (and they had made an end of eating) and when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What meaneth this noise and uproar in the city?",
      "42": "And as he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the Priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in: for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.",
      "43": "And Jonathan answered, and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.",
      "44": "And the king hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule.",
      "45": "And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence with joy, and the city is moved: this is the noise that ye have heard.",
      "46": "And Solomon also sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.",
      "47": "And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon more famous than thy name, and exalt his throne above thy throne: therefore the king worshipped upon the bed.",
      "48": "And thus said the king also, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath made one to sit on my throne this day, even in my sight.",
      "49": "Then all the guests that were with Adonijah, were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.",
      "50": "And Adonijah fearing the presence of Solomon, arose and went, and took hold on the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "And one told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah doth fear king Solomon: for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me this day, that he will not slay his servant with the sword.",
      "52": "Then Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth, but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.",
      "53": "Then king Solomon sent, and they brought him from the altar, and he came and did obeisance unto King Solomon. And Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house."

      "1": "Then the days of David drew near that he should die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying,",
      "2": "I go the way of all the earth: be strong therefore, and show thyself a man,",
      "3": "And take heed to the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and in everything whereunto thou turnest thee,",
      "4": "That the Lord may confirm his word which he spake unto me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, that they walk before me in truth, with all their hearts, and with all their souls, thou shalt not (said he) want one of thy posterity upon the throne of Israel.",
      "5": "Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains to the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed blood of battle in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.",
      "6": "Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let thou not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.",
      "7": "But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among them that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.",
      "8": "And behold, with thee is Shimei the son of Gera, the son of Benjamin, of Bahurim, which cursed me with an horrible curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I will not slay thee with the sword.",
      "9": "But thou shalt not count him innocent: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him: therefore thou shalt cause his hoar head to go down to the grave with blood.",
      "10": "So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.",
      "11": "And the days which David reigned upon Israel, were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.",
      "12": "Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established mightily.",
      "13": "And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon: and she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Yea.",
      "14": "He said moreover, I have a suit unto thee. And she said, Say on.",
      "15": "Then he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned away, and is my brother’s: for it came to him by the Lord.",
      "16": "Now therefore I ask thee one request, refuse me not. And she said unto him, Say on.",
      "17": "And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the King, (for he will not say thee nay) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.",
      "18": "And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee unto the King.",
      "19": "Bathsheba therefore went unto King Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah: and the king rose to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne: and he caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand.",
      "20": "Then she said, I desire a small request of thee, say me not nay. Then the King said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.",
      "21": "She said then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.",
      "22": "But king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also: for he is mine elder brother, and hath for him both Abiathar the Priest, and Joab the son of Zeruiah.",
      "23": "Then King Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.",
      "24": "Now therefore as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, who hath also made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall surely die this day.",
      "25": "And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he smote him that he died.",
      "26": "Then the King said unto Abiathar the Priest, Go to Anathoth unto thine own fields: for thou art worthy of death: but I will not this day kill thee, because thou barest the Ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because thou hast suffered in all, wherein my father hath been afflicted.",
      "27": "So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being Priest unto the Lord, that he might fulfill the words of the Lord, which he spake against the house of Eli in Shiloh.",
      "28": "Then tidings came to Joab: (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, but he turned not after Absalom) and Joab fled unto the Tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.",
      "29": "And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled unto the Tabernacle of the Lord, and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.",
      "30": "And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him, Thus saith the King, Come out. And he said, Nay, but I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.",
      "31": "And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and smite him, and bury him, that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed causeless, from me, and from the house of my father.",
      "32": "And the Lord shall bring his blood upon his own head, for he smote two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not: to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether captain of the host of Judah.",
      "33": "Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace forever from the Lord.",
      "34": "So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and smote him and slew him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.",
      "35": "And the King put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and the king set Zadok the Priest in the room of Abiathar.",
      "36": "Afterward the king sent, and called Shimei and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and depart not thence any whither.",
      "37": "For that day that thou goest out, and passest over the river of Kidron, know assuredly, that thou shalt die the death: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.",
      "38": "And Shimei said unto the king, The thing is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.",
      "39": "And after three years two of the servants of Shimei fled away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.",
      "40": "And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.",
      "41": "And it was told Solomon, that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.",
      "42": "And the King sent and called Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, saying, That day that thou goest out, and walkest any whither, know assuredly that thou shalt die the death? And thou saidest unto me, The thing is good, that I have heard.",
      "43": "Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment wherewith I charged thee?",
      "44": "The King said also to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness whereunto thine heart is privy, that thou didst to David my father: the Lord therefore shall bring thy wickedness upon thine own head.",
      "45": "And let king Solomon be blessed, and the throne of David established before the Lord forever.",
      "46": "So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada: who went out and smote him that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."

      "5": "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.",
      "6": "And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, when he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee: and thou hast kept for him this great mercy, and hast given him a son, to sit on his throne, as appeareth this day.",

      "11": "And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to hear judgment,",
      "12": "Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and understanding heart, so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall arise the like unto thee.",
