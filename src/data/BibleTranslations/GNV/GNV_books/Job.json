      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz called Job, and this man was an upright and just man, one that feared God, and eschewed evil.",
      "2": "And he had seven sons, and three daughters.",
      "3": "His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and his family was very great, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.",
      "4": "And his sons went and banqueted in their houses, every one his day, and sent, and called their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
      "5": "And when the days of their banqueting were gone about, Job sent, and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts, thus did Job every day.",
      "6": "Now on a day when the children of God came and stood before the Lord, Satan came also among them.",
      "7": "Then the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, saying, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it.",
      "8": "And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou not considered my servant Job, how none is like him in the earth? an upright and just man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?",
      "10": "Hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.",
      "11": "But stretch out now thine hand and touch all that he hath, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.",
      "12": "Then the Lord said unto Satan, Lo, all that he hath is in thine hand: only upon himself shalt thou not stretch out thine hand. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "And on a day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,",
      "14": "There came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places,",
      "15": "And the Sabeans came violently, and took them: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
      "16": "And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said, The fire of God is fallen from the heaven, and hath burnt up the sheep and the servants, and devoured them: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
      "17": "And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said, The Chaldeans set on three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
      "18": "And while he was yet speaking, came another, and said, Thy sons, and thy daughters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,",
      "19": "And behold, there came a great wind from beyond the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, which fell upon the children, and they are dead, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
      "20": "Then Job arose, and rent his garment, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,",
      "21": "And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken it: blessed be the Name of the Lord.",
      "22": "In all this did not Job sin, nor charge God foolishly."

      "3": "And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou not considered my servant Job, how none is like him in the earth? an upright and just man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? for yet he continueth in his uprightness, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.",
      "4": "And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, and all that ever a man hath, will he give for his life.",
      "5": "But stretch now out thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.",
      "6": "Then the Lord said unto Satan, Lo, he is in thine hand, but save his life.",
      "7": "So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils, from the sole of his foot unto his crown.",
      "8": "And he took a potsherd to scrape him, and he sat down among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou continue yet in thine uprightness? Blaspheme God, and die.",
      "10": "But he said unto her, Thou speakest like a foolish woman: what? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.",
      "11": "Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, to wit, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they were agreed together to come to lament with him, and to comfort him.",
      "12": "So when they lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not: therefore they lifted up their voices and wept, and every one of them rent his garment and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward the heaven.",
      "13": "So they sat by him upon the ground seven days, and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that the grief was very great."

      "1": "Afterward Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.",

      "3": "Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night when it was said, There is a man child conceived.",
      "4": "Let that day be darkness, let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it,",
      "5": "But let darkness and the shadow of death stain it: let the cloud remain upon it, and let them make it fearful as a bitter day.",
      "6": "Let darkness possess that night, let it not be joined unto the days of the year, nor let it come into the count of the months.",
      "7": "Yea, desolate be that night, and let no joy be in it.",
      "8": "Let them that curse the day, (being ready to renew their mourning) curse it.",
      "9": "Let the stars of that twilight be dim through darkness of it: let it look for light, but have none: neither let it see the dawning of the day,",
      "10": "Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.",
      "11": "Why died I not in the birth? or why died I not, when I came out of the womb?",
      "12": "Why did the knees prevent me? and why did I suck the breasts?",
      "13": "For so should I now have lain and been quiet, I should have slept then, and been at rest,",
      "14": "With the kings and counselors of the earth, which have built themselves desolate places:",
      "15": "Or with the princes that had gold, and have filled their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Or why was I not hid, as an untimely birth, either as infants, which have not seen the light?",
      "17": "The wicked have there ceased from their tyranny, and there they that labored valiantly, are at rest.",
      "18": "The prisoners rest together, and hear not the voice of the oppressor.",
      "19": "There are small and great, and the servant is free from his master.",
      "20": "Wherefore is the light given to him that is in misery? and life unto them that have heavy hearts?",
      "21": "Which long for death, and if it come not, they would even search it more than treasures:",
      "22": "Which joy for gladness, and rejoice, when they can find the grave.",
      "23": "Why is the light given to the man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?",
      "24": "For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the water.",
      "25": "For the thing I feared, is come upon me, and the thing that I was afraid of, is come unto me.",
      "26": "I had no peace, neither had I quietness, neither had I rest, yet trouble is come."

      "4": "Thy words have confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weak knees.",

      "7": "Remember, I pray thee: who ever perished, being an innocent? or where were the upright destroyed?",
      "8": "As I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.",
      "9": "With the blast of God they perish, and with the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.",
      "10": "The roaring of the Lion, and the voice of the Lioness, and the teeth of the Lion’s whelps are broken.",
      "11": "The Lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the Lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.",
      "12": "But a thing was brought to me secretly, and mine ear hath received a little thereof.",
      "13": "In the thoughts of the visions of the night, when sleep falleth on men,",
      "14": "Fear came upon me, and dread which made all my bones to tremble.",
      "15": "And the wind passed before me, and made the hairs of my flesh to stand up.",
      "16": "Then stood one, and I knew not his face: an image was before mine eyes, and in silence heard I a voice, saying,",
      "17": "Shall man be more just than God? or shall a man be more pure than his Maker?",
      "18": "Behold, he found no steadfastness in his servants, and laid folly upon his Angels.",
      "19": "How much more in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which shall be destroyed before the moth?",
      "20": "They be destroyed from the morning unto the evening: they perish forever, without regard.",

      "4": "His children shall be far from salvation, and they shall be destroyed in the gate, and none shall deliver them.",
      "5": "The hungry shall eat up his harvest: yea, they shall take it from among the thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up their substance.",
      "6": "For misery cometh not forth of the dust, neither doeth affliction spring out of the earth.",
      "7": "But man is born unto travail, as the sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "But I would inquire at God, and turn my talk unto God:",

      "13": "He taketh the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the wicked is made foolish.",
      "14": "They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday, as in the night.",

      "16": "So that the poor hath his hope, but iniquity shall stop her mouth.",
      "17": "Behold, blessed is the man whom God correcteth: therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Almighty.",
      "18": "For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it up: he smiteth, and his hands make whole.",
      "19": "He shall deliver thee in six troubles, and in the seventh the evil shall not touch thee.",
      "20": "In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in battle from the power of the sword.",

      "22": "But thou shalt laugh at destruction and dearth, and shalt not be afraid of the beast of the earth.",
      "23": "For the stones of the field shall be in league with thee, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.",
      "24": "And thou shalt know, that peace shall be in thy tabernacle, and thou shalt visit thine habitation, and shalt not sin.",
