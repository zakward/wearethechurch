      "3": "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,",
      "4": "And declared mightily to be the Son of God, touching the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead)",
      "5": "By whom we have received grace and Apostleship (that obedience might be given unto the faith) for his name among all the Gentiles,",
      "6": "Among whom ye be also the called of Jesus Christ:",
      "7": "To all you that be at Rome beloved of God, called to be Saints: Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is published throughout the whole world.",
      "9": "For God is my witness (whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of his Son) that without ceasing I make mention of you.",
      "10": "Always in my prayers, beseeching that by some means, one time or other I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come unto you.",
      "11": "For I long to see you, that I might bestow among you some spiritual gift, that you might be strengthened:",
      "12": "That is, that I might be comforted together with you, through our mutual faith, both yours and mine.",
      "13": "Now my brethren, I would that ye should not be ignorant, how that I have oftentimes purposed to come unto you (but have been let hitherto) that I might have some fruit also among you, as I have among the other Gentiles.",
      "14": "I am debtor both to the Grecians, and to the Barbarians, both to the wise men and to the unwise.",
      "15": "Therefore, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the Gospel to you also that are at Rome.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Grecian.",
      "17": "For by it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.",
      "18": "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, which withhold the truth in unrighteousness.",
      "19": "Forasmuch as that, which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them.",
      "20": "For the invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his works, to the intent that they should be without excuse:",
      "21": "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was full of darkness.",
      "22": "When they professed themselves to be wise, they became fools.",
      "23": "For they turned the glory of the incorruptible God to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and four footed beasts, and of creeping things.",
      "24": "Wherefore also God gave them up to their hearts lusts, unto uncleanness, to defile their own bodies between themselves:",
      "25": "Which turned the truth of God unto a lie, and worshipped and served the creature, forsaking the Creator which is blessed forever, Amen.",
      "26": "For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.",
      "27": "And likewise also the men left the natural use of the woman, and burned in their lust one toward another, and man with man wrought filthiness, and received in themselves such recompense of their error, as was meet.",
      "28": "For as they regarded not to acknowledge God, even so God delivered them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient,",
      "29": "Being full of all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, of murder, of debate, of deceit, taking all things in the evil part, whisperers,",
      "30": "Backbiters, haters of God, doers of wrong, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, such as can never be appeased, merciless.",

      "3": "And thinkest thou this, O thou man, that condemnest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?",
      "4": "Or despisest thou the riches of his bountifulness, and patience, and long sufferance, not knowing that the bountifulness of God leadeth thee to repentance?",
      "5": "But thou, after thine hardness, and heart that cannot repent, heapest up as a treasure unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the just judgment of God,",

      "7": "That is, to them which through patience in well doing, seek glory, and honor, and immortality, everlasting life:",

      "9": "Tribulation and anguish shall be upon the soul of every man that doeth evil: of the Jew first, and also of the Grecian.",
      "10": "But to every man that doeth good, shall be glory, and honor, and peace: to the Jew first, and also to the Grecian.",

      "12": "For as many as have sinned without the Law, shall perish also without the Law: and as many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by the Law,",
      "13": "(For the hearers of the Law are not righteous before God: but the doers of the Law shall be justified.",
      "14": "For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, they having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves,",
      "15": "Which show the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts accusing one another, or excusing.)",

      "18": "And knowest his will, and triest the things that dissent from it, in that thou art instructed by the Law:",
      "19": "And persuadest thyself that thou art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,",
      "20": "An instructor of them which lack discretion, a teacher of the unlearned, which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law.",
      "21": "Thou therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest, A man should not steal, dost thou steal?",
      "22": "Thou that sayest, A man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, committest thou sacrilege?",
      "23": "Thou that gloriest in the Law, through breaking the Law, dishonorest thou God?",
      "24": "For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.",
      "25": "For circumcision verily is profitable, if thou do the Law: but if thou be a transgressor of the Law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.",
      "26": "Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?",
      "27": "And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature (if it keep the Law) condemn thee which by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the Law?",
      "28": "For he is not a Jew, which is one outward: neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:",
      "29": "But he is a Jew which is one within, and the circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God."

      "4": "God forbid: yea, let God be true, and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and overcome, when thou art judged.",

      "6": "God forbid: (else how shall God judge the world?)",
      "7": "For if the verity of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why am I yet condemned as a sinner?",
      "8": "And (as we are blamed, and as some affirm, that we say) why do we not evil, that good may come thereof? whose damnation is just.",
      "9": "What then? are we more excellent? No, in no wise: for we have already proved, that all, both Jews and Gentiles are under sin,",

      "11": "There is none that understandeth: there is none that seeketh God.",

      "20": "Therefore by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the Law cometh the knowledge of sin.",
      "21": "But now is the righteousness of God made manifest without the Law, having witness of the Law, and of the Prophets,",
      "22": "To wit, the righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all that believe.",
      "23": "For there is no difference: for all have sinned, and are deprived of the glory of God,",
      "24": "And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,",
      "25": "Whom God hath set forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness, by the forgiveness of the sins that are passed,",
      "26": "Through the patience of God, to show at this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and a justifier of him which is of the faith of Jesus.",
      "27": "Where is then the rejoicing? It is excluded. By what Law? of works? Nay: but by the Law of faith.",
      "28": "Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the Law.",
      "29": "God, is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles also? Yes, even of the Gentiles also.",
      "30": "For it is one God, who shall justify circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision through faith.",

      "4": "Now to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by favor, but by debt:",
      "5": "But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.",

      "13": "For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not given to Abraham, or to his seed, through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.",
      "14": "For if they which are of the Law, be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect.",

      "16": "Neither is the gift so, as that which entered in by one that sinned: for the fault came of one offense unto condemnation: but the gift is of many offenses to justification.",
      "17": "For if by the offense of one, death reigned through one, much more shall they which receive that abundance of grace, and of that gift of that righteousness, reign in life through one, that is, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "Likewise then, as by the offense of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation, so by the justifying of one, the benefit abounded toward all men to the justification of life.",
      "19": "For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by that obedience of that one, shall many also be made righteous.",
      "20": "Moreover, the Law entered thereupon, that the offense should abound: nevertheless, where sin abounded, there grace abounded much more:",

      "21": "What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now being freed from sin, and made servants unto God, ye have your fruit in holiness, and the end, everlasting life.",

      "9": "For I once was alive, without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived,",
      "10": "But I died: and the same commandment which was ordained unto life, was found to be unto me unto death.",
