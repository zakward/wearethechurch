      "1": "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God:",
      "2": "As it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.",
      "3": "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, is, Prepare the way of the Lord: make his paths straight.",
      "4": "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of amendment of life, for remission of sins.",
      "5": "And all the country of Judea, and they of Jerusalem went out unto him, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.",
      "6": "Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins: and he did eat locusts and wild honey,",
      "7": "And preached, saying, A stronger than I cometh after me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to stoop down, and unloose.",
      "8": "Truth it is, I have baptized you with water: but he will baptize you with the holy Ghost.",
      "9": "And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.",
      "10": "And as soon as he was come out of the water, John saw the heavens cloven in twain, and the holy Ghost descending upon him like a dove.",
      "11": "Then there was a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.",
      "12": "And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.",
      "13": "And he was there in the wilderness forty days, and was tempted of Satan: he was also with the wild beasts, and the Angels ministered unto him.",
      "14": "Now after that John was committed to prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God,",
      "15": "And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent and believe the Gospel.",
      "16": "And as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers.)",
      "17": "Then Jesus said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.",
      "18": "And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.",
      "19": "And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, as they were in the ship, mending their nets.",
      "20": "And anon he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired servants, and went their way after him.",
      "21": "So they entered into Capernaum: and straightway on the Sabbath day he entered into the Synagogue, and taught.",
      "22": "And they were astonied at his doctrine, for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the Scribes.",
      "23": "And there was in their Synagogue a man in whom was an unclean spirit, and he cried out,",
      "24": "Saying, Ah, what have we to do with thee, O Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee what thou art, even thou holy one of God.",
      "25": "And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.",
      "26": "And the unclean spirit tare him, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.",
      "27": "And they were all amazed, so that they demanded one of another, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for he commandeth even the foul spirits with authority, and they obey him.",
      "28": "And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region bordering on Galilee.",
      "29": "And as soon as they were come out of the Synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.",
      "30": "And Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they told him of her.",
      "31": "And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up, and the fever forsook her by and by, and she ministered unto them.",
      "32": "And when even was come, at what time the Sun setteth, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.",
      "33": "And the whole city was gathered together at the door.",
      "34": "And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases: and he cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew him.",
      "35": "And in the morning very early before day, Jesus arose and went out into a solitary place, and there prayed.",
      "36": "And Simon, and they that were with him, followed carefully after him.",
      "37": "And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.",
      "38": "Then he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for I came out for that purpose.",
      "39": "And he preached in their Synagogues, throughout all Galilee, and cast the devils out.",
      "40": "And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeled down unto him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.",
      "41": "And Jesus had compassion, and put forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I will: be thou clean.",
      "42": "And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.",
      "43": "And after he had given him a straight commandment, he sent him away forthwith,",
      "44": "And said unto him, See thou say nothing to any man, but get thee hence, and show thyself to the Priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimonial unto them.",
      "45": "But when he was departed, he began to tell many things, and to publish the matter: so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."

    "2": {
      "1": "After a few days, he entered into Capernaum again, and it was noised that he was in the house.",
      "2": "And anon many gathered together, insomuch, that the places about the door could not receive any more: and he preached the word unto them.",
      "3": "And there came unto him, that brought one sick of the palsy, borne of four men.",
      "4": "And because they could not come near unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof of the house where he was: and when they had broken it open, they let down the bed, wherein the sick of the palsy lay.",
      "5": "Now when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.",
      "6": "And there were certain of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,",
      "7": "Why doth this man speak such blasphemies? who can forgive sins, but God only?",
      "8": "And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit, that thus they reasoned with themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?",
      "9": "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?",
      "10": "But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath authority in earth to forgive sins, he said unto the sick of the palsy,",
      "11": "I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and get thee hence into thine own house.",
      "12": "And by and by he arose, and took up his bed, and went forth before them all, insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw such a thing.",
      "13": "Then he went forth again toward the sea, and all the people resorted unto him, and he taught them.",
      "14": "And as Jesus passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sit at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.",
      "15": "And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at table in his house, many Publicans and sinners sat at table also with Jesus, and his disciples: for there were many that followed him.",
      "16": "And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with the Publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it, that he eateth and drinketh with Publicans and sinners?",
      "17": "Now when Jesus heard it, he said unto them, The whole have no need of the Physician, but the sick. I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.",
      "18": "And the disciples of John, and the Pharisees did fast, and came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not?",
      "19": "And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those days.",
      "21": "Also no man soweth a piece of new cloth in an old garment: for else the new piece that filled it up, taketh away somewhat from the old, and the breach is worse.",
      "22": "Likewise, no man putteth new wine into old vessels: for else the new wine breaketh the vessels, and the wine runneth out, and the vessels are lost; but new wine must be put into new vessels.",
      "23": "And it came to pass as he went through the corn on the Sabbath day, that his disciples, as they went on their way, began to pluck the ears of corn.",
      "24": "And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the Sabbath day, that which is not lawful?",
      "25": "And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need, and was an hungered, both he, and they that were with him?",
      "26": "How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high Priest, and did eat the Showbread, which were not lawful to eat, but for the Priests, and gave also to them which were with him?",
      "27": "And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "Wherefore the Son of man is Lord, even of the Sabbath."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "And he entered again into the Synagogue, and there was a man which had a withered hand.",
      "2": "And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.",
      "3": "Then he said unto the man which had the withered hand, Arise: stand forth in the midst.",
      "4": "And he said to them, Is it lawful to do a good deed on the Sabbath day, or to do evil? to save the life, or to kill? but they held their peace.",
      "5": "Then he looked round about on them angrily, mourning also for the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored, as whole as the other.",
      "6": "And the Pharisees departed, and straightway gathered a council with the Herodians against him, that they might destroy him.",
      "7": "But Jesus avoided with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, and from Judea,",
      "8": "And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond Jordan: and they that dwelled about Tyre and Sidon, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him in great number.",
      "9": "And he commanded his disciples, that a little ship should wait for him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.",
      "10": "For he had healed many, insomuch that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had plagues.",
      "11": "And when the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.",
      "12": "And he sharply rebuked them, to the end they should not utter him.",
      "13": "Then he went up into a mountain, and called unto him whom he would, and they came unto him.",
      "14": "And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.",
      "15": "And that they might have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:",
      "16": "And the first was Simon, and he named Simon, Peter,",
      "17": "Then James the son of Zebedee, and John James’ brother (and surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.)",
      "18": "And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,",
      "19": "And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him, and they came home.",
      "20": "And the multitude assembled again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.",
      "21": "And when his kinsfolks heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said that he was beside himself.",
      "22": "And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and through the prince of the devils he casteth out devils.",
      "23": "But he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan drive out Satan?",
      "24": "For if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "Or if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot continue.",
      "26": "So if Satan make insurrection against himself, and be divided, he cannot endure, but is at an end.",
      "27": "No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and take away his goods, except he first bind that strong man, and then spoil his house.",
      "28": "Verily I say unto you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the children of men, and blasphemies, wherewith they blaspheme:",
      "29": "But he that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but is culpable of eternal damnation.",
      "30": "Because they said, He had an unclean spirit.",
      "31": "Then came his brethren and mother and stood without, and sent unto him, and called him.",
      "32": "And the people sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren seek for thee without.",
      "33": "But he answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brethren?",
      "34": "And he looked round about on them, which sat in compass about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren.",
      "35": "For whosoever doeth the will of God, he is my brother, my sister, and my mother."

      "2": "And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,",
      "3": "Hearken: Behold, there went out a sower to sow.",
      "4": "And it came to pass as he sowed, that some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the heaven came, and devoured it up.",
      "5": "And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth, and by and by sprang up, because it had not depth of earth.",
      "6": "But as soon as the Sun was up, it was burnt up, and because it had not root, it withered away.",
      "7": "And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, so that it gave no fruit.",
      "8": "Some again fell in good ground, and did yield fruit that sprung up, and grew, and it brought forth, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some an hundredfold.",
      "9": "Then he said unto them, He that hath ears, to hear, let him hear.",
      "10": "And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve, asked him of the parable.",
      "11": "And he said unto them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things be done in parables,",
      "12": "That they seeing, may see, and not discern: and they hearing, may hear, and not understand, lest at any time they should turn, and their sins should be forgiven them.",
      "13": "Again he said unto them, Perceive ye not this parable? how then should ye understand all other parables?",
      "14": "The sower soweth the word.",
      "15": "And these are they that receive the seed by the wayside, in whom the word is sown: but when they have heard it, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.",
      "16": "And likewise they that receive the seed in stony ground, are they, which when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with gladness.",
      "17": "Yet have they no root in themselves, and endure but a time: for when trouble and persecution ariseth for the word, immediately they be offended.",
      "18": "Also they that receive the seed among the thorns, are such as hear the word:",
      "19": "But the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things enter in, and choke the word, and it is unfruitful.",
      "20": "But they that have received seed in good ground, are they that hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit: one corn thirty, another sixty, and some an hundred.",
      "21": "Also he said unto them, Cometh the candle in, to be put under a bushel, or under the bed, and not to be put in a candlestick?",
      "22": "For there is nothing hid, that shall not be opened, neither is there a secret, but that it shall come to light.",
      "23": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
      "24": "And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure you mete, it shall be measured unto you: and unto you that hear, shall more be given.",
      "25": "For unto him that hath, shall it be given, and from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that he hath.",
      "26": "Also he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed in the ground.",
      "27": "And should sleep, and rise up night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he not knowing how.",
      "28": "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ears, after that full corn in the ears.",
      "29": "And as soon as the fruit showeth itself, anon he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.",
      "30": "He said moreover, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?",
      "31": "It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is the least of all seeds that be in the earth:",
      "32": "But after that it is sown, it groweth up, and is greatest of all herbs, and beareth great branches, so that the fowls of the heaven may build under the shadow of it.",
      "33": "And with many such parables he preached the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.",
      "34": "And without parables spake he nothing unto them: but he expounded all things to his disciples apart.",
      "35": "Now the same day when even was come, he said unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.",
      "36": "And they left the multitude, and took him as he was in the ship, and there was also with him other little ships.",
      "37": "And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves dashed into the ship, so that it was now full.",
      "38": "And he was in the stern asleep on a pillow: and they awoke him, and said to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?",
      "39": "And he arose up, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, and be still. So the wind ceased, and it was a great calm.",
      "40": "Then he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?",
      "41": "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that both the wind and sea obey him?"

      "3": "Who had his abiding among the graves, and no man could bind him, no not with chains:",
      "4": "Because that when he was often bound with fetters and chains, he plucked the chains asunder, and brake the fetters in pieces, neither could any man tame him.",
      "5": "And always both night and day he cried in the mountains, and in the graves, and struck himself with stones.",

      "14": "And the swineherds fled, and told it in the city, and in the country, and they came out to see what it was that was done.",
      "15": "And they came to Jesus, and saw him that had been possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sit both clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.",
      "16": "And they that saw it, told them, what was done to him that was possessed with the devil, and concerning the swine.",

      "18": "And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil, prayed him that he might be with him.",
      "19": "Howbeit, Jesus would not suffer him, but said unto him, Go thy way home to thy friends, and show them what great things the Lord hath done unto thee, and how he hath had compassion on thee.",
      "20": "So he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis, what great things Jesus had done unto him: and all men did marvel.",
