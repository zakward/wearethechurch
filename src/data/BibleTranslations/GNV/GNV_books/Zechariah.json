      "4": "Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Turn you now from your evil ways, and from your wicked works: but they would not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the Lord.",
      "5": "Your fathers, where are they? and do the Prophets live forever?",
      "6": "But did not my words and my statutes, which I commanded by my servants the Prophets, take hold of your fathers? and they returned, and said, As the Lord of hosts hath determined to do unto us according to our own ways, and according to our works, so hath he dealt with us.",

      "5": "Then the Angel that talked with me, answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my Lord.",
      "6": "Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Neither by an army nor strength, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.",
      "7": "Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel? thou shall be a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof, with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.",

      "4": "I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that falsely sweareth by my Name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and stones thereof.",
