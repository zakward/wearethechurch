      "1": "The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. In the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in the palace of Shushan,",
      "2": "Came Hanani, one of my brethren, he and the men of Judah, and I asked them concerning the Jews that were delivered, which were of the residue of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.",
      "3": "And they said unto me, The residue that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and in reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.",
      "4": "And when I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,",
      "5": "And said, O Lord God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him, and observe his commandments,",
      "6": "I pray thee let thine ears be attent, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee daily, day and night for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee, both I and my father’s house have sinned:",
      "7": "We have grievously sinned against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.",
      "8": "I beseech thee, remember the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, Ye will transgress, and I will scatter you abroad among the people.",
      "9": "But if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though your scattering were to the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather you from thence, and will bring you unto the place that I have chosen to place my Name there.",
      "10": "Now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy mighty hand.",
      "11": "O Lord, I beseech thee, let thine ear now hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy Name, and I pray thee, cause thy servant to prosper this day, and give him favor in the presence of this man: for I was the king’s butler."

      "1": "Now in the month Nisan in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, the wine stood before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I was not before time sad in his presence.",
      "2": "And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing, but sorrow of heart. Then was I sore afraid,",
      "3": "And I said to the King, God save the king forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city and house of the sepulchers of my fathers lieth waste, and the gates thereof are devoured with fire?",
      "4": "And the king said unto me, For what thing doest thou require? Then I prayed to the God of heaven,",
      "5": "And said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, I desire that thou wouldest send me to Judah unto the city of the sepulchers of my fathers, that I may build it.",
      "6": "And the King said unto me, (the Queen also sitting by him:) How long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou come again? So it pleased the king, and he sent me, and I set him a time.",
      "7": "After I said unto the King, If it please the King, let them give me letters to the captains beyond the River, that they may convey me over, till I come into Judah,",
      "8": "And letters unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s park, that he may give me timber to build the gates of the palace (which appertained to the house) and for the walls of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God upon me.",
      "9": "Then came I to the captains beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. And the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.",
      "10": "But Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah a servant an Ammonite heard it, and it grieved them sore, that there was come a man which sought the wealth of the children of Israel.",
      "11": "So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.",
      "12": "And I rose in the night, I, and a few men with me: for I told no man, what God had put in mine heart to do at Jerusalem, and there was not a beast with me, save the beast whereon I rode.",
      "13": "And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and came before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, how they were broken down, and the ports thereof devoured with the fire.",
      "14": "Then I went forth unto the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s fish pool, and there was no room for the beast that was under me to pass.",
      "15": "Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and coming back, I entered by the gate of the valley, and returned.",
      "16": "And the rulers knew not whither I was gone, nor what I did, neither did I as yet tell it unto the Jews, nor to the Priests, nor to the noble men, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that labored in the work.",
      "17": "Afterward I said unto them, Ye see the misery that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire: come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.",
      "18": "Then I told them of the hand of my God, (which was good over me) and also of the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise, and build. So they strengthened their hand to good.",
      "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant an Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they mocked us, and despised us, and said, What a thing is this that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?",
      "20": "Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us, and we his servants will rise up and build: but as for you, ye have no portion nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem."

      "11": "Also our adversaries had said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.",
      "12": "But when the Jews (which dwelt beside them) came, they told us ten times, From all places, whence ye shall return, they will be upon us.",
      "13": "Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall upon the tops of the stones, and placed the people by their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.",
      "14": "Then I beheld, and rose up, and said unto the princes, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the great Lord, and fearful, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.",
      "15": "And when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, then God brought their counsel to nought, and we turned all again to the wall, every one unto his work.",
      "16": "And from that day half of the young men did the labor, and the other half part of them held the spears, and shields, and bows, and habergeons: and the Rulers stood behind all the house of Judah.",
      "17": "They that built on the wall, and they that bare burdens, and they that laded, did the work with one hand, and with the other held the sword.",
      "18": "For every one of the builders had his sword girded on his loins, and so built: and he that blew the trumpet, was beside me.",
      "19": "Then said I unto the Princes, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.",
      "20": "In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.",
      "21": "So we labored in the work, and half of them held the spears, from the appearing of the morning, till the stars came forth.",
      "22": "And at the same time said I unto the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that they may be a watch for us in the night, and labor in the day.",
      "23": "So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the ward (which followed me) none of us did put off our clothes, save everyone put them off for washing."

      "3": "And there were that said, We must gage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and take up corn for the famine.",
      "4": "There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute upon our lands and our vineyards.",
      "5": "And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, and our sons as their sons: and lo, we bring into subjection our sons and our daughters, as servants, and there be of our daughters now in subjection, and there is no power in our hands: for other men have our lands and our vineyards.",
      "6": "Then was I very angry when I heard their cry and these words.",
      "7": "And I thought in my mind, and I rebuked the princes, and the rulers, and said unto them, You lay burdens every one upon his brethren: and I set a great assembly against them,",
      "8": "And I said unto them, We (according to our ability) have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen: and will you sell your brethren again, or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and could not answer.",
      "9": "I said also, That which ye do, is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, for the reproach of the heathen our enemies?",
      "10": "For even I, my brethren, and my servants do lend them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this burden.",
      "11": "Restore, I pray you, unto them this day their lands, their vineyards, their olives, and their houses, and remit the hundredth part of the silver and of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil that ye exact of them.",
      "12": "Then said they, We will restore it, and will not require it of them: we will do as thou hast said. Then I called the Priests and caused them to swear, that they should do according to this promise.",
      "13": "So I shook my lap, and said, So let God shake out every man that will not perform this promise, from his house, and from his labor: even thus let him be shaken out and emptied. And all the Congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord: and the people did according to this promise.",
      "14": "And from the time that the King gave me charge to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year, even unto the two and thirtieth year of King Artaxerxes, that is, twelve years, I, and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.",
      "15": "For the former governors that were before me, had been chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: yea, and their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.",
      "16": "But rather I fortified a portion in the work of this wall, and we bought no land, and all my servants came thither together unto the work.",
      "17": "Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews, and rulers, which came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.",
      "18": "And there was prepared daily an ox, and six chosen sheep, and birds were prepared for me, and within ten days wine for all in abundance. Yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor: for the bondage was grievous unto this people.",

      "2": "Then sent Sanballat and Geshem unto me, saying, come thou that we may meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono: and they thought to do me evil.",
      "3": "Therefore I sent messengers unto them, saying, I have a great work to do, and I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it and come down to you?",
      "4": "Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort. And I answered them after the same manner.",
      "5": "Then sent Sanballat his servant after this sort unto me the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,",
      "6": "Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for the which cause thou buildest the wall, and thou wilt be their king according to these words.",
      "7": "Thou hast also ordained the Prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a King in Judah: and now according to these words it shall come to the King’s ears: come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.",
      "8": "Then I sent unto him, saying, It is not done according to these words that thou sayest: for thou feignest them of thine own heart.",

      "16": "And when all our enemies heard thereof, even all the heathen that were about us, they were afraid, and their courage failed them: for they knew that this work was wrought by our God.",
      "17": "And in these days were there many of the princes of Judah, whose letters went unto Tobiah, and those of Tobiah came unto them.",
      "18": "For there were many in Judah, that were sworn unto him: for he was the son in law of Shechaniah, the son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.",
