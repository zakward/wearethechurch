      "2": "I have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, saith the Lord? Yet I loved Jacob,",
      "3": "And I hated Esau, and made his mountains waste, and his heritage a wilderness for dragons.",
      "4": "Though Edom say, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places: yet saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will destroy it, and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and the people, with whom the Lord is angry forever.",

      "8": "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is not evil: and if ye offer the lame and sick, it is not evil: offer it now unto thy princes: will he be content with thee, or accept thy person, saith the Lord of hosts?",
      "9": "And now I pray you, pray before God that he may have mercy upon us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons, saith the Lord of hosts?",
      "10": "Who is there even among you that would shut the doors, and kindle not fire on mine altar in vain? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.",
      "11": "For from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, my Name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering: for my Name is great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.",
      "12": "But ye have polluted it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof even his meat is not to be regarded.",
      "13": "Ye said also, Behold, it is a weariness, and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts, and ye offered that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick: thus ye offered an offering: should I accept this of your hand, saith the Lord?",
      "14": "But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great king, saith the Lord of hosts, and my Name is terrible among the heathen."

      "6": "The Law of truth was in his mouth, and there was no iniquity found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.",
      "7": "For the Priest’s lips should preserve knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.",
      "8": "But ye are gone out of the way: ye have caused many to fall by the Law: ye have broken the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.",
      "9": "Therefore have I also made you to be despised, and vile before all the people, because ye kept not my ways, but have been partial in the Law.",
      "10": "Have we not all one father? hath not one God made us? why do we transgress everyone against his brother, and break the covenant of our fathers?",
      "11": "Judah hath transgressed, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: for Israel hath defiled the holiness of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.",
      "12": "The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this: both the master and the servant out of the Tabernacle of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts.",
      "13": "And this have ye done again, and covered the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and with mourning: because the offering is no more regarded, neither received acceptably at your hands.",
      "14": "Yet ye say, Wherein? Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast transgressed: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
      "15": "And did not he make one? yet had he abundance of spirit: and wherefore one? because he sought a godly seed: therefore keep yourselves in your spirit, and let none trespass against the wife of his youth.",
      "16": "If thou hatest her, put her away, saith the Lord God of Israel, yet he covereth the injury under his garment, saith the Lord of hosts: therefore keep yourselves in your spirit, and transgress not.",
      "17": "Ye have wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye say wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Everyone that doeth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them. Or where is the God of judgment?"

      "2": "But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall endure, when he appeareth? for he is like a purging fire, and like fuller’s soap.",
      "3": "And he shall sit down to try and fine the silver: he shall even fine the sons of Levi and purify them as gold and silver, that they may bring offerings unto the Lord in righteousness.",
      "4": "Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be acceptable unto the Lord, as in old time and in the years afore.",
      "5": "And I will come near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the soothsayers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that wrongfully keep back the hireling’s wages, and vex the widow, and the fatherless, and oppress the stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.",
      "6": "For I am the Lord: I change not, and ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.",

      "13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord: yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?",
      "14": "Ye have said, It is in vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his commandment, and that we walked humbly before the Lord of hosts?",
      "15": "Therefore we count the proud blessed: even they that work wickedness, are set up, and they that tempt God, yea, they are delivered.",
      "16": "Then spake they that feared the Lord, everyone to his neighbor, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name.",
      "17": "And they shall be to me, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day that I shall do this, for a flock, and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
