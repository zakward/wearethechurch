      death: 'Died at age 930 (Genesis 5:5).',
      chronology: -4000, // Approximate BCE, pre-historical
      biblicalEvents: 'God created Adam from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him (Genesis 2:7). Placed in the Garden of Eden to tend it, Adam named the animals (Genesis 2:15-20). God created Eve from Adam\'s rib as his companion (Genesis 2:21-25). Tempted by the serpent, Eve ate from the forbidden tree, and Adam followed, leading to the Fall and expulsion from Eden (Genesis 3:1-24). They had sons Cain, Abel (Genesis 4:1-2), and after Abel\'s murder, Seth (Genesis 4:25), along with other children (Genesis 5:4). Adam lived 930 years (Genesis 5:5).',
      theologicalSignificance: 'Represents humanity\'s original state of innocence, the introduction of original sin through disobedience, and serves as a type of Christ as the "last Adam" who brings redemption (Romans 5:12-21; 1 Corinthians 15:45). Emphasizes human responsibility, the consequences of sin, and God\'s plan for salvation.',
      historicalNote: 'As a pre-historical figure, there is no archaeological or extra-biblical historical evidence for Adam. The account is foundational to biblical narrative but considered mythological or symbolic by many scholars.'

Bore Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-2), and after Abel\'s death, Seth (Genesis 4:25). Mother of additional children (Genesis 5:4).',
      theologicalSignificance: 'Illustrates the role of woman in creation, the entry of sin through deception, and the promise of redemption through her offspring who would crush the serpent (Genesis 3:15), seen as a protoevangelium pointing to Christ.',
      historicalNote: 'Like Adam, Eve is a pre-historical figure with no archaeological or extra-biblical evidence. The narrative is viewed as etiological myth explaining human origins and suffering in many scholarly interpretations.'

      chronology: -2500, // Approximate flood era
      biblicalEvents: 'Born to Lamech, found grace in God\'s eyes amid widespread wickedness (Genesis 5:28-6:8). Commanded to build an ark and gather animals and family (Genesis 6:9-22). Entered the ark at age 600, floodwaters came for 40 days, waters prevailed 150 days (Genesis 7:1-8:5). Sent out raven and dove, exited ark after a year, offered sacrifices (Genesis 8:6-22). Received covenant never to flood earth again (Genesis 9:1-17). Planted vineyard, became drunk, cursed Canaan (Genesis 9:18-27). Lived 350 more years (Genesis 9:28-29).',
      theologicalSignificance: 'Exemplifies faith and obedience, God\'s judgment on sin and mercy in salvation, prefigures baptism and new creation (1 Peter 3:20-21), and establishes the Noahic covenant preserving the world for redemption.',
      historicalNote: 'No direct archaeological evidence exists for Noah personally. However, Mesopotamian flood narratives like the Epic of Gilgamesh parallel the biblical story, suggesting a historical regional flood event around 2900 BCE in Mesopotamia. Underwater explorations by Robert Ballard indicate evidence of a catastrophic Black Sea flood around 5600 BCE that may inspire the legend. Young Earth creationists cite global geological features like fossil graveyards as evidence of a worldwide flood, though mainstream science attributes these to other processes over millions of years. Some scholars propose a local Mesopotamian flood as the basis for the myth. (Extra-biblical sources and interpretations vary widely.)'

      theologicalSignificance: 'Model of justifying faith (Romans 4; Galatians 3), foundation of God\'s covenant people, through whom the Messiah would come, blessing all nations (Genesis 12:3; Galatians 3:8).',
      historicalNote: 'No direct archaeological evidence confirms Abraham\'s existence as a historical individual, and many scholars view the patriarchal narratives as legendary or etiological stories composed later. However, elements like the cities of Ur and Haran are attested archaeologically, with Ur excavated showing advanced Mesopotamian culture around 2000 BCE. Names and customs in the stories align with second-millennium BCE Near Eastern contexts, such as Nuzi tablets referencing similar social practices. The Tel Dan stele mentions "House of David," indirectly supporting later Israelite traditions, but not directly Abraham. (Extra-biblical; scholarly consensus leans against historicity, though some conservative views affirm it based on contextual fit.)'
