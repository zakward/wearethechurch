      "2": "The Lord gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his power, as well as some of the vessels of the house of God. These he brought to the land of Shinar, and he placed the vessels in the treasury of his gods.",
      "3": "Then the king commanded his palace master Ashpenaz to bring some of the Israelites of the royal family and of the nobility:",
      "4": "young men without physical defect and handsome, versed in every branch of wisdom, endowed with knowledge and insight, and competent to serve in the king’s palace; they were to be taught the literature and language of the Chaldeans.",
      "5": "The king assigned them a daily portion of the royal rations of food and wine. They were to be educated for three years, so that at the end of that time they could be stationed in the king’s court.",
      "6": "Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the tribe of Judah.",
      "7": "The palace master gave them other names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.",
      "8": "But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the royal rations of food and wine, so he asked the palace master to allow him not to defile himself.",
      "9": "Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion from the palace master.",
      "10": "The palace master said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king; he has appointed your food and your drink. If he should see you in poorer condition than the other young men of your age, you would endanger my head with the king.”",
      "11": "Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:",
      "12": "“Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
      "13": "You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations and deal with your servants according to what you observe.”",
      "14": "So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations.",
      "16": "So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.",
      "17": "To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams.",
      "18": "At the end of the time that the king had set for them to be brought in, the palace master brought them into the presence of Nebuchadnezzar,",
      "19": "and the king spoke with them. Among them all, no one was found to compare with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they were stationed in the king’s court.",
      "20": "In every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.",

      "3": "he said to them, “I have had such a dream that my spirit is troubled by the desire to understand it.”",
      "4": "The Chaldeans said to the king (in Aramaic), “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the interpretation.”",
      "5": "The king answered the Chaldeans, “This is a public decree: if you do not tell me both the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins.",
      "6": "But if you do tell me the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”",
      "7": "They answered a second time, “Let the king first tell his servants the dream, then we can give its interpretation.”",
      "8": "The king answered, “I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time because you see the decree from me is firm:",
      "9": "if you do not tell me the dream, there is but one verdict for you. You have agreed to speak lying and misleading words to me until things take a turn. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”",
      "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can reveal what the king demands! In fact, no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.",
      "11": "The thing that the king is asking is too difficult, and no one can reveal it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”",
      "12": "Because of this the king flew into a violent rage and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.",
      "13": "The decree was issued, and the wise men were about to be executed, and they looked for Daniel and his companions, to execute them.",
      "14": "Then Daniel responded with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the king’s chief executioner, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon;",
      "15": "he asked Arioch, the royal official, “Why is the decree of the king so urgent?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.",
      "16": "So Daniel went in and requested that the king give him time and he would tell the king the interpretation.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, of the matter",
      "18": "and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.",
      "20": "Daniel said:\n“Blessed be the name of God from age to age,\n    for wisdom and power are his.",
      "21": "He changes times and seasons,\n    deposes kings and sets up kings;\nhe gives wisdom to the wise\n    and knowledge to those who have understanding.",
      "22": "He reveals deep and hidden things;\n    he knows what is in the darkness,\n    and light dwells with him.",
      "23": "To you, O God of my ancestors,\n    I give thanks and praise,\nfor you have given me wisdom and power\n    and have now revealed to me what we asked of you,\n    for you have revealed to us what the king ordered.”",
      "24": "Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation.”",
      "25": "Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can tell the king the interpretation.”",
      "26": "The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”",
      "27": "Daniel answered the king, “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners can show to the king the mystery that the king is asking,",
      "28": "but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has disclosed to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at the end of days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed were these:",
      "29": "To you, O king, as you lay in bed, came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and the revealer of mysteries disclosed to you what is to be.",
      "30": "But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living being, but in order that the interpretation may be known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.",
      "31": "“You were looking, O king, and there appeared a great statue. That statue was huge, its brilliance extraordinary; it was standing before you, and its appearance was frightening.",
      "32": "The head of that statue was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its midsection and thighs of bronze,",
      "33": "its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.",
      "34": "As you looked on, a stone was cut out, not by human hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken in pieces and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",
      "36": "“That was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.",
      "37": "You, O king, the king of kings—to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the might, and the glory,",
      "38": "into whose hand he has given human beings wherever they live, the wild animals of the field, and the birds of the air and whom he has established as ruler over them all—you are the head of gold.",
      "39": "After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over the whole earth.",
      "40": "And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron; just as iron crushes and smashes everything, it shall crush and shatter all these.",
      "41": "As you saw the feet and toes partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the strength of iron shall be in it, as you saw the iron mixed with the clay.",
      "42": "As the toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.",
      "43": "As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so will they mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.",
      "44": "And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall this kingdom be left to another people. It shall crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever,",
      "45": "just as you saw that a stone was cut from the mountain not by hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has informed the king what shall be hereafter. The dream is certain and its interpretation trustworthy.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that a grain offering and incense be offered to him.",
      "47": "The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!”",
      "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel, gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court."

      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue whose height was sixty cubits and whose width was six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent for the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to assemble and come to the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "3": "So the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. When they were standing before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up,",
      "4": "the herald proclaimed aloud, “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,",
      "5": "that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.",
      "6": "Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.”",
      "7": "Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "Accordingly, at this time certain Chaldeans came forward and denounced the Jews.",
      "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!",
      "10": "You, O king, have made a decree, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, shall fall down and worship the golden statue,",
      "11": "and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.",
      "12": "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men pay no heed to you, O king. They do not serve your gods, and they do not worship the golden statue that you have set up.”",
      "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought in, so they brought those men before the king.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods and you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up?",
      "15": "Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble, you should fall down and worship the statue that I have made. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire, and who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter.",
      "17": "If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and out of your hand, O king, let him deliver us.",
      "18": "But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up.”",
      "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary",
      "20": "and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "21": "So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "22": "Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.",
      "23": "But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up quickly. He said to his counselors, “Was it not three men that we threw bound into the fire?” They answered the king, “True, O king.”",
      "25": "He replied, “But I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not hurt, and the fourth has the appearance of a god.”",
      "26": "Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.",
      "27": "And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their tunics were not scorched, and not even the smell of fire came from them.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king’s command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.",
      "29": "Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.”",
