      "1": "After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.",
      "2": "Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and was injured, so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.”",
      "3": "But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up, go to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?",
      "4": "Now therefore thus says the Lord: You shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.” So Elijah went.",
      "5": "The messengers returned to the king, who said to them, “Why have you returned?”",
      "6": "They answered him, “There came a man to meet us, who said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and say to him: Thus says the Lord: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not leave the bed to which you have gone but shall surely die.’ ”",
      "7": "He said to them, “What sort of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?”",
      "8": "They answered him, “A hairy man with a leather belt around his waist.” He said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”",
      "9": "Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill and said to him, “O man of God, the king says: Come down.”",
      "10": "But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "11": "Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He went up and said to him, “O man of God, this is the king’s order: Come down quickly!”",
      "12": "But Elijah answered him, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "13": "Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. So the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, “O man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.",
      "14": "Look, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.”",
      "15": "Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he set out and went down with him to the king",
      "16": "and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?—therefore you shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.”",
      "17": "So he died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken. His brother Jehoram succeeded him as king in the second year of King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.",
      "18": "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?"

    "2": {
      "1": "Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.",
      "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.",
      "3": "The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”",
      "4": "Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.",
      "5": "The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”",
      "6": "Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.",
      "7": "Fifty men of the company of prophets also went and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.",
      "8": "Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and the two of them crossed on dry ground.",
      "9": "When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I may do for you before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.”",
      "10": "He responded, “You have asked a hard thing, yet if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.”",
      "11": "As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven.",
      "12": "Elisha kept watching and crying out, “Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.",
      "13": "He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.",
      "14": "He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water. He said, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? Where is he?” He struck the water again, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha crossed over.",
      "15": "When the company of prophets who were at Jericho saw him at a distance, they declared, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.",
      "16": "They said to him, “See now, we have fifty strong men among your servants; please let them go and seek your master; it may be that the spirit of the Lord has caught him up and thrown him down on some mountain or into some valley.” He responded, “No, do not send them.”",
      "17": "But when they urged him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.” So they sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find him.",
      "18": "When they came back to him (he had remained at Jericho), he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”",
      "19": "Now the people of the city said to Elisha, “The location of this city is good, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.”",
      "20": "He said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.",
      "21": "Then he went to the spring of water and threw the salt into it and said, “Thus says the Lord: I have made this water wholesome; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it.”",
      "22": "So the water has been wholesome to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.",
      "23": "He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, “Go away, baldhead! Go away, baldhead!”",
      "24": "When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.",
      "25": "From there he went on to Mount Carmel and then returned to Samaria."

    "3": {
      "1": "In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria; he reigned twelve years.",
      "2": "He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, though not like his father and mother, for he removed the pillar of Baal that his father had made.",
      "3": "Nevertheless, he clung to the sin of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused Israel to commit; he did not depart from it.",
      "4": "Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder who used to deliver to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.",
      "5": "But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.",
      "7": "As he went he sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you go with me to battle against Moab?” He answered, “I will; I am as you are; my people are your people; my horses are your horses.”",
      "8": "Then he asked, “By which way shall we march?” Jehoram answered, “By the way of the wilderness of Edom.”",
      "9": "So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and when they had made a roundabout march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that were with them.",
      "10": "Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! The Lord has summoned these three kings to hand them over to Moab.”",
      "11": "But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here through whom we may inquire of the Lord?” Then one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”",
      "12": "Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.",
      "13": "Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to your father’s prophets or to your mother’s.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No; it is the Lord who has summoned these three kings to hand them over to Moab.”",
      "14": "Elisha said, “As the Lord of hosts lives, whom I serve, were it not that I have regard for King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would give you neither a look nor a glance.",
      "15": "But get me a musician.” And then, while the musician was playing, the hand of the Lord came on him.",
      "16": "And he said, “Thus says the Lord: I will make this wadi full of pools.",
      "17": "For thus says the Lord: You shall see neither wind nor rain, but the wadi shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your army, and your animals.",
      "18": "This is only a trifle in the sight of the Lord, for he will also hand Moab over to you.",
      "19": "You shall conquer every fortified city and every choice city; every good tree you shall fell, all springs of water you shall stop up, and every good piece of land you shall ruin with stones.”",
      "20": "The next day, about the time of the morning offering, suddenly water began to flow from the direction of Edom until the country was filled with water.",
      "21": "When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the frontier.",
      "22": "When they rose early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.",
      "23": "They said, “This is blood; the kings must have fought together and killed one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!”",
      "24": "But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked the Moabites, who fled before them; as they entered Moab, they continued the attack.",
      "25": "The cities they overturned, and on every good piece of land everyone threw a stone until it was covered; every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled. Only at Kir-hareseth did the stone walls remain until the slingers surrounded and attacked it.",
      "26": "When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through opposite the king of Edom, but they could not.",
      "27": "Then he took his firstborn son who was to succeed him and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And great wrath came upon Israel, so they withdrew from him and returned to their own land."

      "1": "Now the wife of a member of the company of prophets cried to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord, but a creditor has come to take my two children as slaves.”",
      "2": "Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.”",
      "3": "He said, “Go outside, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels—and not just a few.",
      "4": "Then go in, shut the door behind you and your children, and start pouring into all these vessels; when each is full, set it aside.”",
      "5": "So she left him and shut the door behind her and her children; they kept bringing vessels to her, and she kept pouring.",
      "6": "When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” But he said to her, “There are no more.” Then the oil stopped flowing.",
      "7": "She came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your children can live on the rest.”",
      "8": "One day Elisha was passing through Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to have a meal. So whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for a meal.",
      "9": "She said to her husband, “Look, I am sure that this man who regularly passes our way is a holy man of God.",
      "10": "Let us make a small roof chamber with walls and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”",
      "11": "One day when he came there, he went up to the chamber and lay down there.",
      "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him.",
      "13": "He said to him, “Say to her: Since you have taken all this trouble for us, what may be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?” She answered, “I live among my own people.”",
      "14": "He said, “What then may be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”",
      "15": "He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood at the door.",
      "16": "He said, “At this season, in due time, you shall embrace a son.” She replied, “No, my lord, O man of God; do not deceive your servant.”",
      "17": "The woman conceived and bore a son at that season, in due time, as Elisha had declared to her.",
      "18": "When the child was older, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.",
      "19": "He complained to his father, “Oh, my head, my head!” The father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”",
      "20": "He carried him and brought him to his mother; the child sat on her lap until noon, and he died.",
      "21": "She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door on him, and left.",
      "22": "Then she called to her husband and said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again.”",
      "23": "He said, “Why go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.” She said, “It will be all right.”",
      "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Urge the animal on; do not hold back for me unless I tell you.”",
      "25": "So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.\nWhen the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Look, there is the Shunammite woman;",
      "26": "run at once to meet her and say to her: Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?” She answered, “It is all right.”",
      "27": "When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away, but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me.”",
      "28": "Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, ‘Do not mislead me?’ ”",
      "29": "He said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, give no greeting, and if anyone greets you, do not answer, and lay my staff on the face of the child.”",
      "30": "Then the mother of the child said, “As the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave without you.” So he rose up and followed her.",
      "31": "Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. He came back to meet him and told him, “The child has not awakened.”",
      "32": "When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.",
      "33": "So he went in and closed the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord.",
      "34": "Then he got up on the bed and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and while he lay bent over him, the flesh of the child became warm.",
      "35": "He got down, walked once to and fro in the room, then got up again and bent over him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.",
      "36": "Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her. When she came to him, he said, “Take your son.”",
      "37": "She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took her son and left.",
      "38": "When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the company of prophets was sitting before him, he said to his servant, “Put the large pot on, and make some stew for the company of prophets.”",
      "39": "One of them went out into the field to gather herbs; he found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds and came and cut them up into the pot of stew, not knowing what they were.",
      "40": "They served some for the men to eat. But while they were eating the stew, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot!” They could not eat it.",
      "41": "He said, “Then bring some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Serve the people and let them eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.",
      "42": "A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing food from the first fruits to the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, “Give it to the people and let them eat.”",
      "43": "But his servant said, “How can I set this before a hundred people?” So he repeated, “Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the Lord: They shall eat and have some left.”",
      "44": "He set it before them; they ate and had some left, according to the word of the Lord."

      "1": "Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master because by him the Lord had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from a skin disease.",
      "2": "Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife.",
      "3": "She said to her mistress, “If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his skin disease.”",
      "4": "So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said.",
      "5": "And the king of Aram said, “Go, then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.”\nHe went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments.",
      "6": "He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his skin disease.”",
      "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his skin disease? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.”",
      "8": "But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel.”",
      "9": "So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and halted at the entrance of Elisha’s house.",
      "10": "Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.”",
      "11": "But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, “I thought that for me he would surely come out and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and would wave his hand over the spot and cure the skin disease!",
      "12": "Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” He turned and went away in a rage.",
      "13": "But his servants approached and said to him, “Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”",
      "14": "So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.",
      "15": "Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company; he came and stood before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel; please accept a present from your servant.”",
      "16": "But he said, “As the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will accept nothing!” He urged him to accept, but he refused.",
      "17": "Then Naaman said, “If not, please let two mule loads of earth be given to your servant, for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god except the Lord.",
      "18": "But may the Lord pardon your servant on one count: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I do bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant on this one count.”",
      "19": "He said to him, “Go in peace.”\nBut when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,",
      "20": "Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “My master has let that Aramean Naaman off too lightly by not accepting from him what he offered. As the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”",
      "21": "So Gehazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is everything all right?”",
      "22": "He replied, “Yes, but my master has sent me to say, ‘Two members of a company of prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim; please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’ ”",
      "23": "Naaman said, “Please accept two talents.” He urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them in front of Gehazi.",
      "24": "When he came to the citadel, he took the bags from them and stored them inside; he dismissed the men, and they left.",
      "25": "He went in and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant has not gone anywhere at all.”",
      "26": "But he said to him, “Did I not go with you in spirit when someone left his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to accept silver and to accept clothing, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves?",
      "27": "Therefore the skin disease of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he left his presence diseased, as white as snow."

      "2": "Let us go to the Jordan, and let us collect logs there, one for each of us, and build a place there for us to live.” He answered, “Do so.”",
      "3": "Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” And he answered, “I will.”",
      "4": "So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.",
      "5": "But as one was felling a log, his ax head fell into the water; he cried out, “Alas, master! It was borrowed.”",
      "6": "Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.",
      "7": "He said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.",
      "8": "Once when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he took counsel with his officers. He said, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”",
      "9": "But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Take care not to pass this place, for the Arameans are going down there.”",
      "10": "The king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God spoke. More than once or twice he warned a place so that it was on the alert.",
      "11": "The mind of the king of Aram was greatly perturbed because of this; he called his officers and said to them, “Now tell me: Who among us is betraying us to the king of Israel?”",
      "12": "Then one of his officers said, “No one, my lord king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.”",
      "13": "He said, “Go and find where he is; I will send and seize him.” He was told, “He is in Dothan.”",
      "14": "So he sent horses and chariots there and a great army; they came by night and surrounded the city.",
      "15": "When an attendant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. His servant said, “Alas, master! What shall we do?”",
      "16": "He replied, “Do not be afraid, for there are more with us than there are with them.”",
      "17": "Then Elisha prayed, “O Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.",
      "18": "When the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, “Strike this people, please, with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.",
      "19": "Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.",
      "20": "As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they may see.” The Lord opened their eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.",
      "21": "When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, “Father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”",
      "22": "He answered, “No! Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink, and let them go to their master.”",
