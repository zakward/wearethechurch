      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:",
      "2": "For learning about wisdom and instruction,\n    for understanding words of insight,",
      "3": "for gaining instruction in wise dealing,\n    righteousness, justice, and equity;",
      "4": "to teach shrewdness to the simple,\n    knowledge and prudence to the young—",
      "5": "let the wise, too, hear and gain in learning\n    and the discerning acquire skill,",
      "6": "to understand a proverb and a figure,\n    the words of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;\n    fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "Hear, my child, your father’s instruction,\n    and do not reject your mother’s teaching,",
      "9": "for they are a fair garland for your head\n    and pendants for your neck.",
      "10": "My child, if sinners entice you,\n    do not consent.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood;\n    let us wantonly ambush the innocent;",
      "12": "like Sheol let us swallow them alive\n    and whole, like those who go down to the Pit.",
      "13": "We shall find all kinds of costly things;\n    we shall fill our houses with spoil.",
      "14": "Throw in your lot among us;\n    we will all have one purse”—",
      "15": "my child, do not walk in their way;\n    keep your foot from their paths,",
      "16": "for their feet run to evil,\n    and they hurry to shed blood.",
      "17": "For in vain is the net baited\n    while the bird is looking on;",
      "18": "yet they lie in wait—to kill themselves!\n    and set an ambush—for their own lives!",
      "19": "Such is the end of all who are greedy for gain;\n    it takes away the life of its possessors.",
      "20": "Wisdom cries out in the street;\n    in the squares she raises her voice.",
      "21": "At the busiest corner she cries out;\n    at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:",
      "22": "“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?\nHow long will scoffers delight in their scoffing\n    and fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "Give heed to my reproof;\nI will pour out my thoughts to you;\n    I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I have called and you refused,\n    have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,",
      "25": "and because you have ignored all my counsel\n    and would have none of my reproof,",
      "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity;\n    I will mock when panic strikes you,",
      "27": "when panic strikes you like a storm\n    and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,\n    when distress and anguish come upon you.",
      "28": "Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;\n    they will seek me diligently but will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated knowledge\n    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
      "30": "would have none of my counsel\n    and despised all my reproof,",
      "31": "therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way\n    and be sated with their own devices.",
      "32": "For waywardness kills the simple,\n    and the complacency of fools destroys them;",
      "33": "but those who listen to me will be secure\n    and will live at ease without dread of disaster.”"

      "5": "then you will understand the fear of the Lord\n    and find the knowledge of God.",
      "6": "For the Lord gives wisdom;\n    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;",
      "7": "he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;\n    he is a shield to those who walk blamelessly,",
      "8": "guarding the paths of justice\n    and preserving the way of his faithful ones.",

      "11": "prudence will watch over you,\n    and understanding will guard you.",
      "12": "It will save you from the way of evil,\n    from those who speak perversely,",
      "13": "who forsake the paths of uprightness\n    to walk in the ways of darkness,",
      "14": "who rejoice in doing evil\n    and delight in the perverseness of evil,",
      "15": "those whose paths are crooked\n    and who are devious in their ways.",
      "16": "You will be saved from the loose woman,\n    from the adulteress with her smooth words,",
      "17": "who forsakes the partner of her youth\n    and forgets her sacred covenant,",
      "18": "for her way leads down to death\n    and her paths to the shades;",
      "19": "those who go to her never come back,\n    nor do they regain the paths of life.",
      "20": "Therefore walk in the way of the good,\n    and keep to the paths of the just.",
      "21": "For the upright will abide in the land,\n    and the innocent will remain in it,",
      "22": "but the wicked will be cut off from the earth,\n    and the treacherous will be rooted out of it."

      "11": "My child, do not despise the Lord’s discipline\n    or be weary of his reproof,",
      "12": "for the Lord reproves the one he loves,\n    as a father the son in whom he delights.",
      "13": "Happy are those who find wisdom\n    and those who get understanding,",
      "14": "for her income is better than silver\n    and her revenue better than gold.",
      "15": "She is more precious than jewels,\n    and nothing you desire can compare with her.",
      "16": "Long life is in her right hand;\n    in her left hand are riches and honor.",
      "17": "Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\n    and all her paths are peace.",

      "23": "Then you will walk on your way securely,\n    and your foot will not stumble.",
      "24": "If you sit down, you will not be afraid;\n    when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.",
      "25": "Then you will not be afraid of sudden panic\n    or of the storm that strikes the wicked,",
      "26": "for the Lord will be your confidence\n    and will keep your foot from being caught.",
      "27": "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,\n    when it is in your power to do it.",
      "28": "Do not say to your neighbor, “Go and come again;\n    tomorrow I will give it,” when you have it with you.",
      "29": "Do not plan harm against your neighbor\n    who lives trustingly beside you.",
      "30": "Do not quarrel with anyone without cause,\n    when no harm has been done to you.",
      "31": "Do not envy the violent,\n    and do not choose any of their ways,",
