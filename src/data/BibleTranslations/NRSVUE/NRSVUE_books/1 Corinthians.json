      "2": "To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus,",
      "5": "for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind—",
      "6": "just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you—",
      "7": "so that you are not lacking in any gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful, by whom you were called into the partnership of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you but that you be knit together in the same mind and the same purpose.",
      "11": "For it has been made clear to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters.",
      "12": "What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”",

      "14": "I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.",
      "16": "I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.",
      "17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel—and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.",
      "18": "For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
      "19": "For it is written,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\n    and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”",
      "20": "Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
      "21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of the proclamation, to save those who believe.",
      "22": "For Jews ask for signs and Greeks desire wisdom,",
      "23": "but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to gentiles,",
      "24": "but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.",
      "26": "Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.",
      "27": "But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;",
      "28": "God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to abolish things that are,",
      "29": "so that no one might boast in the presence of God.",
      "30": "In contrast, God is why you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,",

      "3": "And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.",
      "4": "My speech and my proclamation were made not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,",

      "6": "Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are being destroyed.",
      "7": "But we speak God’s wisdom, a hidden mystery, which God decreed before the ages for our glory",
      "8": "and which none of the rulers of this age understood, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
      "9": "But, as it is written,\n“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,\n    nor the human heart conceived,\nwhat God has prepared for those who love him”—",
      "10": "God has revealed to us through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.",
      "11": "For what human knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.",
      "13": "And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.",
      "14": "Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.",
      "15": "Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.",

      "3": "for you are still fleshly. For as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not fleshly and behaving according to human inclinations?",
      "4": "For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not all too human?",
      "5": "What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.",
      "7": "So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.",
      "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and each will receive wages according to their own labor.",
      "9": "For we are God’s coworkers, working together; you are God’s field, God’s building.",
      "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building on it. Let each builder choose with care how to build on it.",
      "11": "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—",
      "13": "the work of each builder will become visible, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each has done.",
      "14": "If the work that someone has built on the foundation survives, the builder will receive a wage.",
      "15": "If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire.",
      "16": "Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.",
      "18": "Do not deceive yourselves. If you think that you are wise in this age, you should become fools so that you may become wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,\n“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”",
      "20": "and again,\n“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,\n    that they are futile.”",
      "21": "So let no one boast about people. For all things are yours,",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,",

      "4": "I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.",
      "5": "Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.",
      "6": "I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, brothers and sisters, so that you may learn through us what “Not beyond what is written” means, so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against another.",
      "7": "For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive?",
      "8": "Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Quite apart from us you have become kings! If only you had become kings, so that we might be kings with you!",
      "9": "For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to humans.",
      "10": "We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are sensible people in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.",
      "11": "To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are naked and beaten and homeless,",
      "12": "and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;",
      "13": "when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.",
      "14": "I am not writing this to make you ashamed but to admonish you as my beloved children.",
      "15": "For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.",
      "16": "I appeal to you, then, be imitators of me.",
      "17": "For this reason I sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, as I teach them everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "But some of you, thinking that I am not coming to you, have become arrogant.",
      "19": "But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.",
      "20": "For the kingdom of God depends not on talk but on power.",

      "3": "For I, though absent in body, am present in spirit, and as if present I have already pronounced judgment",
      "4": "in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled and my spirit is present with the power of our Lord Jesus,",
      "5": "you are to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.",
      "6": "Your boasting is not a good thing. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens all of the dough?",
      "7": "Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, as you really are unleavened. For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed.",
      "8": "Therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",

      "6": "Instead, brothers and sisters go to court against one another, and this before the unbelievers.",
      "7": "In fact, to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?",

      "13": "And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce the husband.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through the brother. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.",

      "34": "and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin are anxious about the affairs of the Lord, so that they may be holy in body and spirit, but the married woman is anxious about the affairs of the world, how to please her husband.",

      "37": "But if someone stands firm in his resolve, being under no necessity but having his own desire under control, and has determined in his own mind to keep her as his fiancée, he will do well.",
      "38": "So then, he who marries his fiancée does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do better.",
