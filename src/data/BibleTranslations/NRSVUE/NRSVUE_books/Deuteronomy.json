      "1": "These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan—in the wilderness, on the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.",
      "2": "(By the way of Mount Seir it takes eleven days to reach Kadesh-barnea from Horeb.)",
      "3": "In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites just as the Lord had commanded him to speak to them.",
      "4": "This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth in Edrei.",
      "5": "Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law as follows:",
      "6": "“The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.",
      "7": "Resume your journey, and go into the hill country of the Amorites as well as into the neighboring regions—the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah, the Negeb, and the seacoast—the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.",
      "8": "See, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them.’",
      "9": "“At that time I said to you, ‘I am unable by myself to bear you.",
      "10": "The Lord your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars of heaven.",
      "11": "May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more and bless you, as he has promised you!",
      "12": "But how can I bear the heavy burden of your disputes all by myself?",
      "13": "Choose for each of your tribes individuals who are wise, discerning, and reputable, and I will make them your leaders.’",
      "14": "You answered me, ‘The plan you have proposed is a good one.’",
      "15": "So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and reputable individuals, and installed them as leaders over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officials, throughout your tribes.",
      "16": "I charged your judges at that time: ‘Give the members of your community a fair hearing and judge rightly between one person and another, whether kin or resident alien.",
      "17": "You must not be partial in judging: hear out the small and the great alike; you shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God’s. Any case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.’",
      "18": "So I charged you at that time with all the things that you should do.",
      "19": "“Then, just as the Lord our God had ordered us, we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, until we reached Kadesh-barnea.",
      "20": "I said to you, ‘You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.",
      "21": "See, the Lord your God has given the land to you; go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you; do not fear or be dismayed.’",
      "22": "“All of you came to me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we should go up and the cities we will come to.’",
      "23": "The plan seemed good to me, and I selected twelve of you, one from each tribe.",

      "25": "and gathered some of the land’s produce, which they brought down to us. They brought back a report to us and said, ‘It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.’",

      "36": "except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his descendants I will give the land on which he set foot, because of his complete fidelity to the Lord.’",
      "37": "Even with me the Lord was angry on your account, saying, ‘You also shall not enter there.",
      "38": "Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, shall enter there; encourage him, for he is the one who will secure Israel’s possession of it.",
      "39": "And as for your little ones who you thought would become plunder, your children who today do not yet know right from wrong, they shall enter there; to them I will give it, and they shall take possession of it.",

      "43": "Although I told you, you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country.",
      "44": "The Amorites who lived in that hill country then came out against you and chased you as bees do. They beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah.",
      "45": "When you returned and wept before the Lord, the Lord would neither heed your voice nor pay you any attention.",

      "3": "‘You have been skirting this hill country long enough. Head north,",
      "4": "and charge the people as follows: “You are about to pass through the territory of your kindred, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful",
      "5": "not to engage in battle with them, for I will not give you even so much as a foot’s length of their land, since I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.",
      "6": "You shall purchase food from them for money, so that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them for money, so that you may drink.",
      "7": "Surely the Lord your God has blessed you in all your undertakings; he knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.” ’",
      "8": "So we passed by our kin, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, leaving behind the route of the Arabah and leaving behind Elath and Ezion-geber.\n“When we had headed out along the route of the wilderness of Moab,",
      "9": "the Lord said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab or engage them in battle, for I will not give you any of its land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’",
      "10": "(The Emim—a large and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim—had formerly inhabited it.",
      "11": "Like the Anakim, they are usually reckoned as Rephaim, though the Moabites call them Emim.",
      "12": "Moreover, the Horim had formerly inhabited Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, destroying them and settling in their place, as Israel has done in the land that the Lord gave them as a possession.)",
      "13": "‘Now then, proceed to cross over the Wadi Zered.’\n“So we crossed over the Wadi Zered.",
      "14": "And the length of time we had traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn concerning them.",
      "15": "Indeed, the Lord’s own hand was against them, to root them out from the camp, until all had perished.",
      "16": "“Just as soon as all the warriors had died off from among the people,",
      "17": "the Lord spoke to me, saying,",
      "18": "‘Today you are going to cross the boundary of Moab at Ar.",
      "19": "When you approach the frontier of the Ammonites, do not harass them or engage them in battle, for I will not give the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot.’",
      "20": "(It also is usually reckoned as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly inhabited it, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,",
      "21": "a strong and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place.",
      "22": "He did the same for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by destroying the Horites before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their place even to this day.",
      "23": "As for the Avvim, who had lived in settlements in the vicinity of Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)",
      "24": "‘Proceed on your journey and cross the Wadi Arnon. See, I have handed over to you King Sihon the Amorite of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession by engaging him in battle.",
      "25": "This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven; when they hear report of you, they will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’",
      "26": "“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following terms of peace:",
      "27": "‘If you let me pass through your land, I will travel only along the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.",
      "28": "You shall sell me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot—",
      "29": "just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir have done for me and likewise the Moabites who live in Ar—until I cross the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.’",
      "30": "But King Sihon of Heshbon was not willing to let us pass through, for the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart defiant in order to hand him over to you, as he has now done.",
      "31": "“The Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to take possession of his land.’",
      "32": "So when Sihon came out against us, he and all his people for battle at Jahaz,",
      "33": "the Lord our God gave him over to us, and we struck him down, along with his offspring and all his people.",
      "34": "At that time we captured all his towns, and in each town we utterly destroyed men, women, and children. We left not a single survivor.",
      "35": "Only the livestock we kept as spoil for ourselves, as well as the plunder of the towns that we had captured.",
      "36": "From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon (including the town that is in the wadi itself) as far as Gilead, there was no citadel too high for us. The Lord our God gave everything to us.",
      "37": "You did not encroach, however, on the land of the Ammonites, avoiding the whole upper region of the Wadi Jabbok as well as the towns of the hill country, just as the Lord our God had charged."

    "3": {
      "1": "“When we headed up the road to Bashan, King Og of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.",

      "3": "So the Lord our God also handed over to us King Og of Bashan and all his people. We struck him down until not a single survivor was left.",
      "4": "At that time we captured all his towns; there was no citadel that we did not take from them: sixty towns, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",
      "5": "All these were fortress towns with high walls, double gates, and bars, besides a great many villages.",
      "6": "And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, in each city utterly destroying men, women, and children.",
      "7": "But all the livestock and the plunder of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.",
      "8": "“So at that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land beyond the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon",

      "10": "all the towns of the tableland, the whole of Gilead, and all of Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.",
      "11": "(Now only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. In fact, his bed, an iron bed, can still be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites. By the common cubit it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide.)",
      "12": "As for the land that we took possession of at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the territory north of Aroer that is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as well as half the hill country of Gilead with its towns,",
      "13": "and I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, Og’s kingdom. (The whole region of Argob: all that portion of Bashan used to be called a land of Rephaim;",
      "14": "Jair the Manassite acquired the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he named them—that is, Bashan—after himself, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)",
      "15": "To Machir I gave Gilead.",
      "16": "And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Wadi Arnon, with the middle of the wadi as a boundary, and up to the Jabbok, the wadi being boundary of the Ammonites;",

      "18": "“At that time, I charged you as follows: ‘Although the Lord your God has given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the vanguard of your Israelite kin.",
      "19": "Only your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you.",

      "22": "Do not fear them, for it is the Lord your God who fights for you.’",
      "23": "“At that time, too, I entreated the Lord, saying,",

      "25": "Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon.’",
