      "5": "If thieves came to you,\n    if plunderers by night\n    —how you have been destroyed!—\n    would they not steal only what they wanted?\nIf grape gatherers came to you,\n    would they not leave gleanings?",

      "11": "On the day that you stood aside,\n    on the day that strangers carried off his wealth\nand foreigners entered his gates\n    and cast lots for Jerusalem,\n    you, too, were one of them.",
      "12": "But you should not have gloated over your brother\n    on the day of his misfortune;\nyou should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah\n    on the day of their ruin;\nyou should not have boasted\n    on the day of distress.",
      "13": "You should not have entered the gate of my people\n    on the day of their calamity;\nyou should not have joined in the gloating over Judah’s disaster\n    on the day of his calamity;\nyou should not have stolen his goods\n    on the day of his calamity.",
