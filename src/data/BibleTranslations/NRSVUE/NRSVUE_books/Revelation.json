      "14": "His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire;",
      "15": "his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.",
      "16": "In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force.",
      "17": "When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last",
      "18": "and the Living One. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys of Death and of Hades.",

      "3": "I also know that you are enduring and bearing up for the sake of my name and that you have not grown weary.",
      "4": "But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.",
      "5": "Remember, then, from where you have fallen; repent and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.",
      "6": "Yet this is to your credit: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.",

      "21": "I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.",
      "22": "Beware, I am throwing her on a bed, and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great distress, unless they repent of her doings,",
      "23": "and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve.",
