      "2": "I write to God’s church in the city of Corinth. I write to those who belong to Christ Jesus and to those who are set apart by Him and made holy. I write to all the Christians everywhere who call on the name of Jesus Christ. He is our Lord and their Lord also.",
      "3": "May you have loving-favor and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I am thankful to God all the time for you. I am thankful for the loving-favor God has given to you because you belong to Christ Jesus.",
      "5": "He has made your lives rich in every way. Now you have power to speak for Him. He gave you good understanding.",
      "6": "This shows that what I told you about Christ and what He could do for you has been done in your lives.",
      "7": "You have the gifts of the Holy Spirit that you need while you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ to come again.",
      "8": "Christ will keep you strong until He comes again. No blame will be held against you.",
      "9": "God is faithful. He chose you to be joined together with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Christian brothers, I ask you with all my heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to agree among yourselves. Do not be divided into little groups. Think and act as if you all had the same mind.",
      "11": "My Christian brothers, I have heard from some of Chloe’s family that you are arguing among yourselves.",
      "12": "I hear that some of you are saying, “I am a follower of Paul,” and “I am a follower of Apollos,” and “I am a follower of Peter,” and “I am a follower of Christ.”",
      "13": "Has Christ been divided? Was Paul put on a cross to die for your sins? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
      "14": "I am thankful to God that I baptized Crispus and Gaius only.",
      "15": "No one can say that you were baptized in the name of Paul.",
      "16": "I remember I did baptize the family of Stephanas, but I do not remember baptizing any others.",
      "17": "Christ did not send me to baptize. He sent me to preach the Good News. I did not use big sounding words when I preached. If I had, the power of the cross of Christ would be taken away.",
      "18": "Preaching about the cross sounds foolish to those who are dying in sin. But it is the power of God to those of us who are being saved from the punishment of sin.",
      "19": "The Holy Writings say, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise people. I will put aside the learning of those who think they know a lot.”",
      "20": "Where is the man who is wise? Where is the man who thinks he knows a lot? Where is the man who thinks he has all the answers? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.",
      "21": "In His wisdom, He did not allow man to come to know Him through the wisdom of this world. It pleased God to save men from the punishment of their sins through preaching the Good News. This preaching sounds foolish.",
      "22": "The Jews are looking for something special to see. The Greek people are looking for the answer in wisdom.",
      "23": "But we preach that Christ died on a cross to save them from their sins. These words are hard for the Jews to listen to. The Greek people think it is foolish.",
      "24": "Christ is the power and wisdom of God to those who are chosen to be saved from the punishment of sin for both Jews and Greeks.",
      "25": "God’s plan looked foolish to men, but it is wiser than the best plans of men. God’s plan which may look weak is stronger than the strongest plans of men.",
      "26": "Christian brothers, think who you were when the Lord called you. Not many of you were wise or powerful or born into the family of leaders of a country.",
      "27": "But God has chosen what the world calls foolish to shame the wise. He has chosen what the world calls weak to shame what is strong.",
      "28": "God has chosen what is weak and foolish of the world, what is hated and not known, to destroy the things the world trusts in.",
      "29": "In that way, no man can be proud as he stands before God.",
      "30": "God Himself made the way so you can have new life through Christ Jesus. God gave us Christ to be our wisdom. Christ made us right with God and set us apart for God and made us holy. Christ bought us with His blood and made us free from our sins.",

      "3": "When I was with you, I was weak. I was afraid and I shook.",
      "4": "What I had to say when I preached was not in big sounding words of man’s wisdom. But it was given in the power of the Holy Spirit.",
      "5": "In this way, you do not have faith in Christ because of the wisdom of men. You have faith in Christ because of the power of God.",
      "6": "We speak wisdom to full-grown Christians. This wisdom is not from this world or from the leaders of today. They die and their wisdom dies with them.",
      "7": "What we preach is God’s wisdom. It was a secret until now. God planned for us to have this honor before the world began.",
      "8": "None of the world leaders understood this wisdom. If they had, they would not have put Christ up on a cross to die. He is the Lord of shining-greatness.",
      "9": "The Holy Writings say, “No eye has ever seen or no ear has ever heard or no mind has ever thought of the wonderful things God has made ready for those who love Him.”",
      "10": "God has shown these things to us through His Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit Who looks into all things, even the secrets of God, and shows them to us.",
      "11": "Who can know the things about a man, except a man’s own spirit that is in him? It is the same with God. Who can understand Him except the Holy Spirit?",
      "12": "We have not received the spirit of the world. God has given us His Holy Spirit that we may know about the things given to us by Him.",
      "13": "We speak about these things also. We do not use words of man’s wisdom. We use words given to us by the Holy Spirit. We use these words to tell what the Holy Spirit wants to say to those who put their trust in Him.",
      "14": "But the person who is not a Christian does not understand these words from the Holy Spirit. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because he does not have the Holy Spirit to help him understand.",
      "15": "The full-grown Christian understands all things, and yet he is not understood.",

      "1": "Christian brothers, I could not speak to you as to full-grown Christians. I spoke to you as men who have not obeyed the things you have been taught. I spoke to you as if you were baby Christians.",
      "2": "My teaching was as if I were giving you milk to drink. I could not give you meat because you were not ready for it. Even yet you are not able to have anything but milk.",
      "3": "You still live as men who are not Christians. When you are jealous and fight with each other, you are still living in sin and acting like sinful men in the world.",
      "4": "When one says, “I am a follower of Paul,” and another says, “I am a follower of Apollos,” does not this sound like the talk of baby Christians?",
      "5": "Who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only servants owned by God. He gave us gifts to preach His Word. And because of that, you put your trust in Christ.",
      "6": "I planted the seed. Apollos watered it, but it was God Who kept it growing.",
      "7": "This shows that the one who plants or the one who waters is not the important one. God is the important One. He makes it grow.",
      "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters are alike. Each one will receive his own reward.",
      "9": "For we work together with God. You are God’s field.\nYou are God’s building also.",
      "10": "Through God’s loving-favor to me, I laid the stones on which the building was to be built. I did it like one who knew what he was doing. Now another person is building on it. Each person who builds must be careful how he builds on it.",
      "11": "Jesus Christ is the Stone on which other stones for the building must be laid. It can be only Christ.",
      "12": "Now if a man builds on the Stone with gold or silver or beautiful stones, or if he builds with wood or grass or straw,",
      "13": "each man’s work will become known. There will be a day when it will be tested by fire. The fire will show what kind of work it is.",
      "14": "If a man builds on work that lasts, he will receive his reward.",
      "15": "If his work is burned up, he will lose it. Yet he himself will be saved as if he were going through a fire.",
      "16": "Do you not know that you are a house of God and that the Holy Spirit lives in you?",
      "17": "If any man destroys the house of God, God will destroy him. God’s house is holy. You are the place where He lives.",
      "18": "Do not fool yourself. If anyone thinks he knows a lot about the things of this world, he had better become a fool. Then he may become wise.",
      "19": "The wisdom of this world is foolish to God. The Holy Writings say, “He is the One Who gets them in a trap when they use their own wisdom.”",
      "20": "They also say, “The Lord knows how the wise man thinks. His thinking is worth nothing.”",
      "21": "As a Christian, do not be proud of men and of what they can do. All things belong to you.",
      "22": "Paul and Apollos and Peter belong to you. The world and life and death belong to you. Things now and things to come belong to you.",

      "3": "It is not the most important thing to me what you or any other people think of me. Even what I think of myself does not mean much.",
      "4": "As for me, my heart tells me I am not guilty of anything. But that does not prove I am free from guilt. It is the Lord Who looks into my life and says what is wrong.",
      "5": "Do not be quick to say who is right or wrong. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring into the light the things that are hidden in men’s hearts. He will show why men have done these things. Every man will receive from God the thanks he should have.",
      "6": "Christian brothers, I have used Apollos and myself to show you what I am talking about. This is to help you so you will not think more of men than what God’s Word will allow. Never think more of one of God’s servants than another.",
      "7": "Who made you better than your brother? Or what do you have that has not been given to you? If God has given you everything, why do you have pride? Why do you act as if He did not give it to you?",
      "8": "You are full. You are rich. You live like kings and we do not. I wish you were kings and we could be leaders with you.",
      "9": "I think that God has made a show of us missionaries. We are the last and the least among men. We are like men waiting to be put to death. The whole world, men and angels alike, are watching us.",
      "10": "We are thought of as fools because of Christ. But you are thought of as wise Christians! We are weak. You are strong. People respect you. They have no respect for us.",
      "11": "To this hour we are hungry and thirsty, and our clothes are worn out. People hurt us. We have no homes.",
      "12": "We work with our hands to make a living. We speak kind words to those who speak against us. When people hurt us, we say nothing.",

      "17": "For this reason I have sent Timothy to you. He is my much-loved child and a faithful Christian. He will tell you how I act as a Christian. This is the kind of life I teach in the churches wherever I go.",
      "18": "Some of you are full of pride. You think that I am not coming to visit you.",
      "19": "If the Lord wants me to, I will come soon. I will find out when I come if these proud people have God’s power, or if they just use a lot of big words.",
      "20": "The holy nation of God is not made up of words. It is made up of power.",

      "2": "Instead of being sorry, you are proud of yourselves. The man who is living like that should be sent away from you.",
      "3": "I am far from you. Even if I am not there, my spirit is with you. I have already said that the man is guilty of this sin. I am saying this as if I were there with you.",

      "6": "It is not good for you to be proud of the way things are going in your church. You know a little yeast makes the whole loaf of bread rise.",
      "7": "Clean out the old yeast. Then you will be new bread with none of the old yeast in you. The Jews killed lambs when they left Egypt. Christ is our lamb. He has already been killed as a gift on the altar to God for us.",
      "8": "Bread with yeast in it is like being full of sin and hate. Let us eat this supper together with bread that has no yeast in it. This bread is pure and true.",

I was not talking about people of this world who always want to get more or those who get things in a wrong way or those who worship false gods. To get away from people like that you would have to leave this world!",

You should not even eat with a person who says he is a Christian but always wants to get more of everything or uses bad language or who gets drunk or gets things in a wrong way.",

      "5": "You should be ashamed! Is it true that there is not one person wise enough in your church to decide who is right when people argue?",
      "6": "Instead, one Christian takes another Christian to court. And that court is made up of people who are not Christians!",
      "7": "This shows you are wrong when you have to go to court against each other. Would it not be better to let someone do something against you that is wrong? Would it not be better to let them rob you?",

A person who does sex sins, or who worships false gods, or who is not faithful in marriage, or men who act like women, or people who do sex sins with their own sex, will have no place in the holy nation of God.",

      "3": "The husband should please his wife as a husband. The wife should please her husband as a wife.",
      "4": "The wife is not the boss of her own body. It belongs to the husband. And in the same way, the husband is not the boss of his own body. It belongs to the wife.",

      "11": "but if she does leave him, she should not get married to another man. It would be better for her to go back to her husband. The husband should not divorce his wife.",
      "12": "I have this to say. These words are not from the Lord. If a Christian husband has a wife who is not a Christian, and she wants to live with him, he must not divorce her.",

      "14": "The husband who is not a Christian is set apart from the sin of the world because of his Christian wife. The wife who is not a Christian is set apart from the sin of the world because of her Christian husband. In this way, the lives of the children are not unclean because of sin, they are clean.",
      "15": "If the one who is not a Christian wants to leave, let that one go. The Christian husband or wife should not try to make the other one stay. God wants you to live in peace.",

      "27": "Are you married to a wife? Do not try to get a divorce. If you are not married, do not look for a wife.",
      "28": "If you do get married, you have not sinned. If a woman who is not married gets married, it is no sin. But being married will add problems. I would like to have you free from such problems.",
      "29": "I mean this, Christian brothers. The time is short. A married man should use his time as if he did not have a wife.",
      "30": "Those who have sorrow should keep on working as if they had no sorrow. Those who have joy should keep on working as if there was no time for joy. Those who buy should have no time to get joy from what they have.",

She wants to please the Lord with her body and spirit. The woman who is married cares for the things of the world. She wants to please her husband.",
      "35": "I am saying these things to help you. I am not trying to keep you from getting married. I want you to do what is best. You should work for Him without other things taking your time.",
      "36": "If a man and woman expect to get married, and he thinks his desires to marry her are getting too strong, and she is getting older, they should get married. It is no sin.",

      "23": "This is the way it is: Christ was raised from the dead first. Then all those who belong to Christ will be raised from the dead when He comes again.",
      "24": "Next, at the end of the world, Christ will give His holy nation over to God the Father. Christ will have destroyed every nation and power.",
      "25": "Christ must be King until He has destroyed all those who hate Him and work against Him.",
      "26": "The last thing that will be destroyed is death.",
      "27": "The Holy Writings say that God has put all things under Christ’s feet except Himself.",
      "28": "When Christ is over all things, He will put Himself under God Who put all things under Christ. And God will be over all things.",
      "29": "What good will it do people if they are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised, why are people baptized for them?",
      "30": "Why are we also in danger every hour?",
      "31": "I say this, Christian brothers, I have joy in what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for you. That is why I face death every day.",
      "32": "As men look at it, what good has it done for me in the city of Ephesus to fight with men who act like wild animals? If the dead are not raised, we might as well be like those who say, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”",
      "33": "Do not let anyone fool you. Bad people can make those who want to live good become bad.",
      "34": "Keep your minds awake! Stop sinning. Some do not know God at all. I say this to your shame.",
      "35": "Someone will say, “How are the dead raised? What kind of bodies will they have?”",
      "36": "What a foolish question! When you plant a seed, it must die before it starts new life.",
      "37": "When you put it in the earth, you are not planting the body which it will become. You put in only a seed.",
      "38": "It is God Who gives it a body just as He wants it to have. Each kind of seed becomes a different kind of body.",
      "39": "All flesh is not the same. Men have one kind of flesh. Animals have another kind. Fish have another kind, and birds have another kind.",
      "40": "There are bodies in the heavens. There are bodies on earth. Their greatness is not the same.",
      "41": "The sun has its greatness. The moon has its greatness. Stars have their greatness. One star is different from another star in greatness.",
      "42": "It is the same with people who are raised from the dead. The body will turn back to dust when it is put in a grave. When the body is raised from the grave, it will never die.",
      "43": "It has no greatness when it is put in a grave, but it is raised with shining-greatness. It is weak when it is put in a grave, but it is raised with power.",
      "44": "It is a human body when it dies, but it is a God-like body when it is raised from the dead. There are human bodies and there are God-like bodies.",
      "45": "The Holy Writings say, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” But the last Adam (Christ) is a life-giving Spirit.",
      "46": "We have these human bodies first. Then we are given God-like bodies that are ready for heaven.",
      "47": "Adam was the first man. He was made from the dust of the earth. Christ was the second man. He came down from heaven.",
      "48": "All men of the earth are made like Adam. But those who belong to Christ will have a body like the body of Christ Who came from heaven.",
      "49": "Now, our bodies are like Adam’s body. But in heaven, our bodies will be like the body of Christ.",
      "50": "Christian brothers, our bodies which are made of flesh and blood will not go into the holy nation of God. That which dies can have no part in that which will never die.",
      "51": "For sure, I am telling you a secret. We will not all die, but we will all be changed.",
      "52": "In a very short time, no longer than it takes for the eye to close and open, the Christians who have died will be raised. It will happen when the last horn sounds. The dead will be raised never to die again. Then the rest of us who are alive will be changed.",
      "53": "Our human bodies made from dust must be changed into a body that cannot be destroyed. Our human bodies that can die must be changed into bodies that will never die.",
      "54": "When this that can be destroyed has been changed into that which cannot be destroyed, and when this that does die has been changed into that which cannot die, then it will happen as the Holy Writings said it would happen. They said, “Death has no more power over life.”",
      "55": "O death, where is your power? O death, where are your pains?",
      "56": "The pain in death is sin. Sin has power over those under the Law.",
      "57": "But God is the One Who gives us power over sin through Jesus Christ our Lord. We give thanks to Him for this.",
      "58": "So then, Christian brothers, because of all this, be strong. Do not allow anyone to change your mind. Always do your work well for the Lord. You know that whatever you do for Him will not be wasted."
