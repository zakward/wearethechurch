      "6": "John wore clothes made of hair from camels. He had a leather belt around him. His food was locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "He preached, saying, “One is coming after me Who is greater than I. I am not good enough to get down and help Him take off His shoes.",

      "42": "At once the disease was gone and the man was healed.",
      "43": "Jesus spoke strong words to the man before He sent him away.",
      "44": "He said to him, “Tell no one about this. Go and let the religious leader of the Jews see you. Give the gifts Moses has told you to give when a man is healed of a disease. Let the leaders know you have been healed.”",
      "45": "But the man went out and talked about it everywhere. After this Jesus could not go to any town if people knew He was there. He had to stay in the desert. People came to Him from everywhere."

      "1": "After some days Jesus went back to the city of Capernaum. Then news got around that He was home.",
      "2": "Soon many people gathered there. There was no more room, not even at the door. He spoke the Word of God to them.",
      "3": "Four men came to Jesus carrying a man who could not move his body.",
      "4": "These men could not get near Jesus because of so many people. They made a hole in the roof of the house over where Jesus stood. Then they let down the bed with the sick man on it.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the sick man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "Some teachers of the Law were sitting there. They thought to themselves,",
      "7": "“Why does this Man talk like this? He is speaking as if He is God! Who can forgive sins? Only One can forgive sins and that is God!”",
      "8": "At once Jesus knew the teachers of the Law were thinking this. He said to them, “Why do you think this in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier to say to the sick man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your bed, and start to walk?’",
      "10": "I am doing this so you may know the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins.” He said to the sick man who could not move his body,",
      "11": "“I say to you, ‘Get up. Take your bed and go to your home.’”",

      "15": "Jesus ate in Levi’s house. Many men who gather taxes and others who were sinners came and sat down with Jesus and His followers. There were many following Him.",
      "16": "The teachers of the Law and the proud religious law-keepers saw Jesus eat with men who gather taxes and others who were sinners. They said to His followers, “Why does He eat and drink with men who gather taxes and with sinners?”",
      "17": "Jesus heard it and said to them, “People who are well do not need a doctor. Only those who are sick need a doctor. I have not come to call those who are right with God. I have come to call those who are sinners.”",
      "18": "The followers of John and the proud religious law-keepers were not eating food so they could pray better. Some people came to Jesus and said, “Why do the followers of John and the proud religious law-keepers go without food so they can pray better, but Your followers do not?”",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “Can the friends at a wedding go without food when the man just married is with them? As long as they have him with them, they will not go without food.",

      "21": "No man sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If it comes off, it will make the hole bigger.",
      "22": "No man puts new wine into old skin bags. The skin would break and the wine would run out. The bags would be no good. New wine must be put into new skin bags.”",
      "23": "At that time Jesus walked through the grain-fields on the Day of Rest. As they went, His followers began to take some of the grain.",
      "24": "The proud religious law-keepers said to Jesus, “See! Why are they doing what the Law says should not be done on the Day of Rest?”",
      "25": "He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he and his men were hungry?",
      "26": "He went into the house of God when Abiathar was head religious leader of the Jews. He ate the special bread used in the religious worship. The Law says only the Jewish religious leaders may eat that. David gave some to those who were with him also.”",
      "27": "Jesus said to them, “The Day of Rest was made for the good of man. Man was not made for the Day of Rest.",

      "4": "Then Jesus said to the proud religious law-keepers, “Does the Law say to do good on the Day of Rest or to do bad, to save life or to kill?” But they said nothing.",
      "5": "Jesus looked around at them with anger. He was sad because of their hard hearts. Then He said to the man, “Put out your hand.” He put it out and his hand was healed. It was as good as the other.",

      "26": "If the devil fights against himself and is divided, he cannot last. He will come to an end.",
      "27": "No man can go into a strong man’s house and take away his things, unless he ties up the strong man first. Only then can he take things from his house.",
      "28": "For sure, I tell you, all sins will be forgiven people, and bad things they speak against God.",
      "29": "But if anyone speaks bad things against the Holy Spirit, he will never be forgiven. He is guilty of a sin that lasts forever.”",
      "30": "Jesus told them this because they said, “He has a demon.”",

      "16": "The seed that fell among rocks is like people who receive the Word with joy when they hear it.",
      "17": "Their roots are not deep so they live only a short time. When sorrow and trouble come because of the Word, they give up and fall away.",
      "18": "The seed that was planted among thorns is like some people who listen to the Word.",
      "19": "But the cares of this life let thorns come up. A love for riches and always wanting other things let thorns grow. These things do not give the Word room to grow so it does not give grain.",
      "20": "The seed that fell on good ground is like people who hear the Word and understand it. They give much grain. Some give thirty times as much grain. Some give sixty times as much grain. Some give one hundred times as much grain.”",

      "28": "The earth gives fruit by itself. The leaf comes first and then the young grain can be seen. And last, the grain is ready to gather.",
      "29": "As soon as the grain is ready, he cuts it. The time of gathering the grain has come.”",
      "30": "Jesus said, “In what way can we show what the holy nation of God is like? Or what picture-story can we use to help you understand?",
      "31": "It is like a grain of mustard seed that is planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds.",
      "32": "After it is put in the ground, it grows and becomes the largest of the spices. It puts out long branches so birds of the sky can live in it.”",
