      "5": "and in the fire was what looked like four living beings. They looked like men,",
      "6": "but each of them had four faces and four wings.",
      "7": "Their legs were straight, and their feet were like those of a calf. They shined like bright brass.",
      "8": "Under their wings on their four sides were hands like a man’s. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,",
      "9": "their wings touched one another. Their faces did not turn when they moved. Each one moved straight ahead.",
      "10": "As for what their faces looked like, each of the four had the face of a man, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of a bull on the left side, and the face of an eagle.",
      "11": "Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Each had two wings touching the wings of another, and two covering their bodies.",
      "12": "And each one went straight ahead. Every place where the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.",
      "13": "Between the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like fire lamps moving from side to side among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was coming out of the fire.",
      "14": "And the living beings ran this way and that, like lightning.",
      "15": "As I looked at the living beings, I saw one wheel on the earth beside each of the living beings with its four faces.",
      "16": "The way the wheels were made, they looked like shining chrysolite stone. All four of them looked the same. They were made to look as if one wheel were within another.",

      "18": "The wheels were so high that they caused fear. And all four of them were full of eyes all around.",
      "19": "When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And when the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also.",
      "20": "Whatever way the spirit would go, they would go that way. And the wheels rose close beside them, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.",
      "21": "When the living beings moved, they moved. When the beings stood still, they stood still. And when the beings rose up from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them. For the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.",

      "24": "When they went, I heard the sound of their wings. They sounded like many waters, like the voice of the All-powerful. They sounded like the noise of an army camp. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.",
      "25": "A voice came from above the large covering over their heads. Whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.",
      "26": "Above the large covering that was over their heads there was something that looked like a throne, and looked like it was made of sapphire. Sitting on the throne was what looked like a man.",
      "27": "Then I saw that there was something like shining brass from the center of his body and up to his head. It looked like fire all around within it. And from the center of his body and down to his feet I saw something like fire. There was a bright light shining all around Him.",
      "28": "This light shining around Him looked like the rainbow in the clouds on a day of rain.\nThis was what the shining-greatness of the Lord looked like. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking."

      "4": "I am sending you to these strong-willed children who show no respect. And you must say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’",

      "3": "And He said to me, “Son of man, eat this book that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
      "4": "Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the people of Israel, and speak My words to them.",
      "5": "For you are not being sent to people of strange speech and a hard language, but to the people of Israel.",
      "6": "You are not being sent to many people of strange speech and a hard language whom you cannot understand. If I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.",
      "7": "But the people of Israel will not listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to Me. All the people of Israel are strong-willed and show no respect.",
      "8": "See, I have made you as strong-willed and as hard as they are.",
      "9": "I have made your forehead harder than the hardest stone. Do not be afraid of them. Do not be afraid of how they look, even if they do not obey Me.”",
      "10": "He said to me, “Son of man, take all My words that I say to you into your heart, and hear with your ears.",

      "12": "Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud sounding voice behind me say, “Great is the shining-greatness of the Lord from His place.”",
      "13": "I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them. It was a loud rushing sound.",
      "14": "The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. And I went with a bitter and angry spirit. The hand of the Lord was strong upon me.",
      "15": "Then I came to the Jews who had been taken from their land and who lived by the Chebar River at Tel-abib. I sat among them seven days where they were living, and I was filled with fear.",
      "16": "At the end of seven days the Word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
      "17": "“Son of man, I have chosen you to be a watchman over the people of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from My mouth, tell them of the danger.",
      "18": "If I say to the sinful man, ‘You will die for sure,’ and you do not tell him of the danger, and try to turn him from his sinful way so that he may live, that sinful man will die in his sin. But you will be guilty for his blood.",
      "19": "But if you tell a sinful man of the danger he is in, and he does not turn from his sins or from his sinful way, then he will die in his sin. But you will have saved yourself.",
      "20": "Again, if a right and good man turns away from his right and good way and sins, and I put a cause of falling in his way, he will die. Because you have not told him of the danger, he will die in his sin, and the right and good things he has done will not be remembered. But you will be guilty for his blood.",
      "21": "Yet if you have told the right and good man of the danger of his sinning, and he does not sin, he will live for sure because he listened to you. And you will have saved yourself.”",
      "22": "The hand of the Lord was upon me there, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and I will speak to you there.”",
      "23": "So I got up and went out to the plain, and saw the shining-greatness of the Lord standing there. It was like the shining-greatness which I saw by the Chebar River, and I fell on my face.",
      "24": "Then the Spirit came into me and made me stand on my feet. And He spoke and said to me, “Go, shut yourself up in your house.",
      "25": "As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you up with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.",
      "26": "And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot speak. You will not be able to speak sharp words to them, for they will not obey Me.",
      "27": "But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you will tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’ He who hears, let him hear. And he who is not willing to hear, let him not be willing. For they are a sinful people."
