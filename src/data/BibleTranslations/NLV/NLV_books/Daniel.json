      "1": "In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem. His army was all around the city.",
      "2": "The Lord let him take King Jehoiakim of Judah, with some of the objects of the house of God. He brought them to the house of his god in the land of Shinar, and put the objects into the store-room of his god.",
      "3": "Then the king told Ashpenaz, his head ruler, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, both those of the king’s family and of the important leaders.",
      "4": "They were to be young men, perfect in body, good-looking, with wisdom, understanding, much learning, and able to serve in the king’s house. The king told Ashpenaz to teach them the writings and language of the Babylonians.",
      "5": "And the king gave them a share of his best food and wine every day. They were to be taught for three years, and after that they were to serve the king.",
      "6": "Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the sons of Judah.",
      "7": "The king’s head ruler gave them new names. To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar. To Hananiah he gave the name Shadrach. To Mishael he gave the name Meshach. And to Azariah he gave the name Abed-nego.",
      "8": "But Daniel made up his mind that he would not make himself unclean with the king’s best food and wine. So he asked the head ruler to allow him not to make himself unclean.",
      "9": "Now God gave Daniel favor and pity in the eyes of the head ruler.",
      "10": "The head ruler said to him, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has said you were to have so much and he would see that you were not looking as good as the other young men who are as old as you. The king would cut off my head because of you.”",
      "11": "Then Daniel said to the man whom the head ruler had chosen to watch over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
      "12": "“Test your servants for ten days. Give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
      "13": "Then compare how we look with the young men who are eating the king’s best food. And do with us what you think is best by what you see.”",
      "14": "So he listened to them, and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of ten days they looked even better. They were fatter than all the young men who had been eating the king’s best food.",
      "16": "So the man who watched over them took away the best food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.",
      "17": "God gave these four young men much learning and understanding in all kinds of writings and wisdom. Daniel even had understanding in all kinds of special dreams.",
      "18": "At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the head ruler brought them to Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "The king talked with them, and found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they became the king’s own helpers.",
      "20": "Every time the king asked them questions that needed wise and understanding answers, he found that they knew ten times more than all the wonder-workers under his rule who used their secret ways.",
      "21": "And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "In the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had a dream. His spirit was troubled and he could not sleep.",
      "2": "Then the king called for the wonder-workers, those who used secret ways, those who learned from stars, to tell the king what he had dreamed. So they came in and stood in front of the king.",
      "3": "The king said to them, “I had a dream that troubles me, and I want to know what the dream means.”",
      "4": "Then those who learn from stars said to the king in the Aramaic language, “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will tell you what it means.”",
      "5": "The king answered, saying, “My word is sure. If you do not tell me what my dream was and what it means, you will be torn apart and your houses will be laid waste.",
      "6": "But if you tell me the dream and what it means, I will give you gifts and riches and great honor. So tell me the dream and what it means.”",
      "7": "They answered the king a second time, saying, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will tell you what it means.”",
      "8": "The king said, “I am sure that you are trying to get more time, because you see that my word is sure.",
      "9": "You know that if you do not tell me what I dreamed, there is only one penalty for you. You have agreed among yourselves to keep telling me lies until things change. So tell me the dream. Then I will know that you can tell me what it means.”",
      "10": "Those who learn from stars answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can do this for the king. For no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any wonder-worker or one who learns from stars.",
      "11": "What the king asks is too hard. No one can do it for you except the gods, who do not live among men.”",
      "12": "Because of this the king became very angry and said that all the wise men of Babylon must be destroyed.",
      "13": "So the law was sent out that the wise men must be killed. They looked for Daniel and his friends, to kill them also.",
      "14": "Then Daniel spoke with wisdom and understanding to Arioch, the captain of the soldiers who watched over the king, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.",
      "15": "He said to Arioch, the king’s captain, “Why is the king’s law so hard?” Then Arioch told him what had happened.",
      "16": "So Daniel went in and asked the king for time, so that he could tell the king what the dream meant.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went to his house and told his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, what had happened.",
      "18": "He told them to ask for loving-pity from the God of heaven about this secret, so that Daniel and his friends might not be killed with the other wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "Then the secret was made known to Daniel in a special dream during the night. He gave honor and thanks to the God of heaven.",
      "20": "Daniel said, “Let the name of God be honored forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.",
      "21": "He changes the times and the years. He takes kings away, and puts kings in power. He gives wisdom to wise men and much learning to men of understanding.",
      "22": "He makes known secret and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness. Light is with Him.",
      "23": "I give thanks and praise to You, O God of my fathers. For You have given me wisdom and power. Even now You have made known what we asked of You. You have made the king’s dream known to us.”",
      "24": "So Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had told to kill the wise men of Babylon. He went and said to him, “Do not kill the wise men of Babylon! Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”",
      "25": "Then Arioch brought Daniel to the king in a hurry, and said to him, “I have found a man among those brought out of Judah who can tell the king the meaning of his dream!”",
      "26": "The king said to Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me the dream I had, and what it means?”",
      "27": "Daniel answered the king and said, “No wise men, wonder-workers, or men who use secret ways can make this dream known to the king.",
      "28": "But there is a God in heaven who makes secrets known. And He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. This was the special dream you had while you were on your bed.",
      "29": "O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would happen in the future. And He Who makes secrets known has let you know what will happen.",
      "30": "But this secret has not been made known to me because I am wiser than any other living man. It was made known to me so that I can make it known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.",
      "31": "“O king, you were looking and saw a great object. The object was large and very bright, and it was standing in front of you. It filled you with fear and wonder as you looked at it.",
      "32": "The object’s head was made of fine gold. Its breast and arms were made of silver. Its stomach and thighs were made of brass.",
      "33": "Its legs were made of iron, and its feet were part iron and part clay.",
      "34": "While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It fell and hit the large object on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like dust on the grain-floor in the summer. The wind carried the dust away so nothing was to be found. But the stone that hit the large object became a large mountain and filled the whole earth.",
      "36": "“This was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means.",
      "37": "You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you the nation, the power, the strength, and the honor.",
      "38": "In every place where people live, or the animals of the field, or the birds of the air, He has given them to you and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "After you there will be another nation that is not as great as yours. A third nation of brass will come, which will rule over all the earth.",
      "40": "Then there will be a fourth nation, as strong as iron. Iron crushes and breaks all things. So, like iron breaks things to pieces, this nation will crush and break all the others.",
      "41": "Just as you saw the feet and toes made of part clay and part iron, it will be a divided nation. But it will have some of the strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with the clay.",
      "42": "As the toes of the feet were made of part iron and part clay, so some of the nation will be strong and part of it will be weak.",
      "43": "As you saw the iron mixed with clay, they will try to join with one another. But they will not stay together any more than iron mixes with clay.",
      "44": "In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a nation which will never be destroyed. And it will never be taken by another people. It will crush and put an end to all these nations, but it will last forever.",
      "45": "You saw how a stone was cut out of the mountain by no human hands, and how it crushed the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God has shown the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true. And I have given you its true meaning.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and gave honor to Daniel. He had a gift and special perfume brought to him.",
      "47": "The king said to Daniel, “For sure your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and He makes hidden things known. For you have been able to make known this secret.”",
      "48": "Then the king gave Daniel much power and gave him many great gifts. He made him ruler over the whole land of Babylon and the head of all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "And Daniel asked the king to put Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego as leaders over the land of Babylon, while Daniel stayed near the king."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made an object of gold which looked like a god. It was fifteen times taller than a man, and as wide as three long steps. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the land of Babylon.",
      "2": "Then Nebuchadnezzar called together all the captains, leaders, rulers, wise men, money-keepers, judges, and law-keepers of Babylon’s lands. He called them to come to the first showing of the object that he had set up.",
      "3": "So all the captains, leaders, rulers, wise men, money-keepers, judges, and law-keepers of Babylon’s lands were gathered together for the special time of setting apart this object Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood in front of it.",
      "4": "Then the man who spread news for the king said in a loud voice, “This is what you must do, O people of every nation and language:",
      "5": "When you hear the sound of the horns and harps, and all kinds of music, you are to get down on your knees and worship the object of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.",
      "6": "Whoever does not get down and worship will be thrown at once into the big and hot fire.”",
      "7": "Then all the people heard the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music. All the people of every nation and language got down and worshiped the object of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "At this time certain ones who learned from stars came up and spoke against the Jews.",
      "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!",
      "10": "You yourself, O king, have made a law that every man who hears the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music is to get down on his knees and worship the object of gold.",
      "11": "And whoever does not get down and worship must be thrown into the big and hot fire.",
      "12": "There are certain Jews whom you have chosen as leaders over the land of Babylon. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. These men have not listened to you, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the object of gold which you have set up.”",
      "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar became very angry and called for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And they were brought to the king.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the object of gold that I have set up?",
      "15": "Now if you are ready to get down on your knees and worship the object I have made when you hear the sound of the horns and harps and all kinds of music, very well. But if you will not worship, you will be thrown at once into the fire. And what god is able to save you from my hands?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer to this question.",
      "17": "If we are thrown into the fire, our God Whom we serve is able to save us from it. And He will save us from your hand, O king.",
      "18": "But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the object of gold that you have set up.”",
      "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger, and he looked at Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego with an angry face. He had the fire made seven times hotter than it was.",
      "20": "And he told certain powerful soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, and to throw them into the fire.",
      "21": "So the men were tied up in their coats and head-coverings and their other clothes, and were thrown into the fire.",
      "22": "Because the king had spoken that the fire was to be very hot, those men who put Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego into the fire were killed by the fire.",
      "23": "The three men were still tied up when they fell into the fire.",
      "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar was very surprised and stood up in a hurry. He said to his leaders, “Did we not throw three men who were tied up into the fire?” They answered, “That is true, O king.”",
      "25": "He said, “Look! I see four men loose and walking about in the fire without being hurt! And the fourth one looks like a son of the gods (or the Son of God)!”",
      "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door where the fire was burning, and said, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the fire.",
      "27": "The captains, leaders, rulers, and the king’s important men gathered around and saw that the fire had not hurt the bodies of these three men. Their hair was not burned. Their clothes were not burned. They did not even smell like fire.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He has sent His angel and saved His servants who put their trust in Him. They changed the king’s word and were ready to give up their lives instead of serving or worshiping any god except their own God.",
      "29": "So I now make a law that if any people of any nation or language say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, they will be torn apart and their houses will be laid waste. For there is no other god who is able to save in this way.”",
      "30": "Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego very important in the land of Babylon."

    "4": {
      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar sent this letter to all the people of every nation and language who live in all the world: “May you have much peace!",
      "2": "I am pleased to tell you about the wonderful things which the Most High God has done for me.",
      "3": "How great are the special things He shows us! How powerful are His wonderful works! His nation lasts forever, and His rule is for all people for all time.",
      "4": "“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house. Everything was going well for me there.",
      "5": "But I had a dream that made me afraid. As I lay on my bed the pictures that passed through my mind filled me with fear.",
      "6": "So I called for all the wise men of Babylon to come and tell me the meaning of my dream.",
      "7": "Then the wonder-workers, those who learn from stars, and those who use their secret ways, came in. I told them about the dream, but they could not tell me what it meant.",
      "8": "At last Daniel came to me, who was given the name Belteshazzar after the name of my god. A spirit of the holy gods is in him, and I told him about my dream. I said,",
      "9": "‘O Belteshazzar, head of the wonder-workers, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no secret is hidden from you. So tell me what dream I had, and what it means.",
      "10": "This is what I saw in my mind as I lay on my bed: I saw a tree in the center of the land. It was very tall.",
      "11": "The tree grew and became strong. Its top went up to the sky, and it could be seen to the end of the whole earth.",
      "12": "Its leaves were beautiful and it had much fruit. It had enough food for everyone. The wild animals of the field rested in its shadow. The birds of the air lived in its branches. And every living thing was fed from it.",
      "13": "‘In the dreams I had as I lay on my bed, I looked and saw an angel who kept watch. He was a holy one who came down from heaven.",
      "14": "He said in a loud voice, “Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Tear off its leaves and throw away its fruit. Let the animals run from under it and the birds fly from its branches.",
      "15": "Yet leave the base of the tree with its roots in the ground, and tie a chain of iron and brass around it. Leave it there in the new grass of the field. Let him be wet with the water from heaven on the grass in the early morning. Let him share with the wild animals in the grass of the earth.",
      "16": "Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and for seven years let him have the mind of an animal.",
      "17": "This penalty is by the law of the angels who keep watch. This is what the holy ones have decided, so that the living may know that the Most High is ruler over the nation of all people. He gives it to whomever He wants, and lets the least important of men rule over it.”",
      "18": "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means. None of the wise men in my nation can tell me what it means, but you can. For the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’",
      "19": "“Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was afraid for a while. His thoughts filled him with fear. The king said, ‘Belteshazzar, do not be afraid of the dream or its meaning.’ Belteshazzar answered, ‘My lord, if only the dream and its meaning had to do with those who hate you and fight against you!",
      "20": "You saw the tree which grew large and strong, whose top went up to the sky and could be seen over all the earth.",
      "21": "Its leaves were beautiful and it had much fruit, enough food for all. Wild animals of the field rested under it, and birds of the air lived in its branches.",
      "22": "This tree is you, O king! For you have become great and strong. Your power has become great and has gone up to the sky, and your rule has gone to the end of the earth.",
      "23": "The king saw an angel who kept watch, a holy one coming down from heaven and saying, “Cut down the tree and destroy it. Yet leave its base with its roots in the ground. Put a chain of iron and brass around it and leave it in the new grass of the field. And let him be wet with the water from heaven on the grass in the early morning. Let him share with the wild animals of the field for seven years.”",
      "24": "This is what it means, O king. This is what the Most High said would happen to my lord the king:",
      "25": "You will be driven away from all people and will live with the wild animals of the field. You will eat grass like cattle and become wet with the water from heaven. Seven years will pass until you understand that the Most High is ruler over the nations of men, and gives them to whomever He wants.",
      "26": "It was said that the base of the tree and its roots must be left. This means that your nation will be returned to you after you understand that it is Heaven that rules.",
      "27": "So, O king, may my words be pleasing to you. Turn away from your sins by doing what is right and good. Turn away from your wrong-doing by being kind to the poor. Then it may be that things will keep going well for you.’",
      "28": "“All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "29": "Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of his beautiful house in Babylon.",
      "30": "And he said, ‘Is not this the great Babylon which I have built as a beautiful place for the king? I have built it by my great strength and for the greatness of my power.’",
      "31": "Before the king was finished speaking, a voice came from heaven, saying, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is said: Your power over the nation has been taken from you.",
      "32": "You will be driven away from all people and will live with the wild animals of the field. You will eat grass like cattle. And seven years will pass until you understand that the Most High is ruler over the nations of men, and gives them to whomever He wants.’",
      "33": "At once these words about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was driven away from all people and began eating grass like cattle. His body became wet with the water from heaven, until his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails like those of birds.",
      "34": "“But at the end of that time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven and my understanding returned to me. And I gave thanks to the Most High and praised and honored Him Who lives forever. For His nation lasts forever, and His rule is for all people for all time.",
      "35": "All the people of the earth are thought of as nothing. He does as He pleases with the angels of heaven and the people of the earth. No one can hold back His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’",
      "36": "At that time my understanding returned to me. And my honor and power were returned to me for the greatness of my nation. My wise men and my leaders began looking for me, and I was made king again, with even more greatness added to me.",
      "37": "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and honor the King of heaven. For all His works are true and His ways are right. And He is able to bring down those who walk in pride.”"

      "3": "So they brought the gold cups that had been taken from the house of God in Jerusalem. And the king and his important men and all his wives drank from them.",
      "4": "They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone.",
      "5": "All at once the fingers of a man’s hand were seen writing on the wall near the lamp-stand of the king’s house. And the king saw the back of the hand as it wrote.",

      "7": "The king called in a loud voice for the wonder-workers, the men who learned from stars and those who used their secret ways. He said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man who can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed with purple clothing and have a chain of gold around his neck. And he will be the third in power in the nation.”",

      "11": "There is a man in your nation who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In your father’s time light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, made him the head of the wonder-workers, the men who learned from stars, and those who use their secret ways.",
      "12": "This was because a special spirit was found in this Daniel whom the king called Belteshazzar. He had much learning and understanding to tell the meaning of dreams and secrets and to give answers to problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what this means.”",
      "13": "So Daniel was brought to the king. And the king said to him, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the people whom my father the king brought from Judah?",

      "15": "The wise men and wonder-workers were brought in to me so that they might read this writing and tell me what it means. But they could not tell me its meaning.",
      "16": "Now I have heard that you are able to tell the meaning of such things and give answers to hard problems. If you are able to read the writing and tell me what it means, you will be dressed in purple and wear a chain of gold around your neck. And you will be the third in power in the nation.”",
      "17": "Then Daniel answered the king, saying, “Keep your gifts for yourself, or give them to someone else. But I will read the writing to the king and tell him what it means.",
      "18": "O king, the Most High made your father Nebuchadnezzar king, and gave him greatness, honor, and power.",
      "19": "Because of the greatness He gave to him, all the people of every nation and language shook in fear in front of him. He killed whomever he wanted. And he let live whomever he wanted. He gave honor to whomever he wanted. And he put down whomever he wanted.",
      "20": "But when his heart and spirit became proud and he acted in pride, he was taken from his throne and his greatness was taken from him.",
      "21": "He was driven away from people, and his mind became like that of an animal. He lived with the wild donkeys. He ate grass like cattle, and his body became wet with the water from heaven. It was like this for him until he understood that the Most High God is ruler over the nation of all men, and that He lets whomever He wants rule it.",
      "22": "Yet you, his son Belshazzar, have not put away the pride from your heart, even though you knew all this.",
      "23": "You have honored yourself more than the Lord of heaven. The cups of His house have been brought to you.
