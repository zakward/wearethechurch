    "1": {
      "1": "This letter is from Paul, a servant owned by God, and a missionary of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to those God has chosen for Himself. I am to teach them the truth that leads to God-like living.",
      "2": "This truth also gives hope of life that lasts forever. God promised this before the world began. He cannot lie.",
      "3": "He made this known at the right time through His Word. God, the One Who saves, told me I should preach it.",
      "4": "I am writing to you, Titus. You are my true son in the faith which we both have. May you have loving-favor and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ, the One Who saves.",
      "5": "I left you on the island of Crete so you could do some things that needed to be done. I asked you to choose church leaders in every city.",
      "6": "Their lives must be so that no one can talk against them. They must have only one wife. Their children must be Christians and known to be good. They must obey their parents. They must not be wild.",
      "7": "A church leader is God’s servant. His life must be so that no one can say anything against him. He should not try to please himself and not be quick to get angry over little things. He must not get drunk or want to fight. He must not always want more money for himself.",
      "8": "He must like to take people into his home. He must love what is good. He must be able to think well and do all things in the right way. He must live a holy life and be the boss over his own desires.",
      "9": "He must hold to the words of truth which he was taught. He must be able to teach the truth and show those who are against the truth that they are wrong.",
      "10": "There are many men who will not listen or will not obey the truth. Their teaching is foolish and they lead people to believe a lie. Some Jews believe their lies.",
      "11": "This must be stopped. It turns whole families from the truth. They teach these things to make money.",
      "12": "One of their own teachers said, “People of the island of Crete always lie. They are like wild animals. They are lazy. All they want to do is eat.”",
      "13": "This is true of them. Speak sharp words to them because it is true. Lead them in the right way so they will have strong faith.",
      "14": "Do not let them listen to Jewish stories made up by men. Do not let them listen to man-made rules which lead them away from the truth.",
      "15": "All things are pure to the man with a pure heart. But to sinful people nothing is pure. Both their minds and their hearts are bad.",
      "16": "They say they know God, but by the way they act, they show that they do not. They are sinful people. They will not obey and are of no use for any good work."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "You must teach what is right and true.",
      "2": "Older men are to be quiet and to be careful how they act. They are to be the boss over their own desires. Their faith and love are to stay strong and they are not to give up.",
      "3": "Teach older women to be quiet and to be careful how they act also. They are not to go around speaking bad things about others or things that are not true. They are not to be chained by strong drink. They should teach what is good.",
      "4": "Older women are to teach the young women to love their husbands and children.",
      "5": "They are to teach them to think before they act, to be pure, to be workers at home, to be kind, and to obey their own husbands. In this way, the Word of God is honored.",
      "6": "Also teach young men to be wise.",
      "7": "In all things show them how to live by your life and by right teaching.",
      "8": "You should be wise in what you say. Then the one who is against you will be ashamed and will not be able to say anything bad about you.",
      "9": "Those who are servants owned by someone must obey their owners and please them in everything. They must not argue.",
      "10": "They must not steal from their owners but prove they can be trusted in every way. In this way, their lives will honor the teaching of God Who saves us.",
      "11": "God’s free gift of being saved is being given to everyone.",
      "12": "We are taught to have nothing to do with that which is against God. We are to have nothing to do with the desires of this world. We are to be wise and to be right with God. We are to live God-like lives in this world.",
      "13": "We are to be looking for the great hope and the coming of our great God and the One Who saves, Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "He gave Himself for us. He did this by buying us with His blood and making us free from all sin. He gave Himself so His people could be clean and want to do good.",
      "15": "Teach all these things and give words of help. Show them if they are wrong. You have the right and the power to do this. Do not let anyone think little of you."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Teach your people to obey the leaders of their country. They should be ready to do any good work.",
      "2": "They must not speak bad of anyone, and they must not argue. They should be gentle and kind to all people.",
      "3": "There was a time when we were foolish and did not obey. We were fooled in many ways. Strong desires held us in their power. We wanted only to please ourselves. We wanted what others had and were angry when we could not have them. We hated others and they hated us.",
      "4": "But God, the One Who saves, showed how kind He was and how He loved us",
      "5": "by saving us from the punishment of sin. It was not because we worked to be right with God. It was because of His loving-kindness that He washed our sins away. At the same time He gave us new life when the Holy Spirit came into our lives.",
      "6": "God gave the Holy Spirit to fill our lives through Jesus Christ, the One Who saves.",
      "7": "Because of this, we are made right with God by His loving-favor. Now we can have life that lasts forever as He has promised.",
      "8": "What I have told you is true. Teach these things all the time so those who have put their trust in God will be careful to do good things. These things are good and will help all men.",
      "9": "Do not argue with people about foolish questions and about the Law. Do not spend time talking about all of your early fathers. This does not help anyone and it is of no use.",
      "10": "Talk once or twice to a person who tries to divide people into groups against each other. If he does not stop, have nothing to do with him.",
      "11": "You can be sure he is going the wrong way. He is sinning and he knows it.",
      "12": "I will send Artemas or Tychicus to you. As soon as one of them gets there, try to come to me in the city of Nicopolis. I have decided to spend the winter there.",
      "13": "Zenas, the man who knows the law, and Apollos are going on a trip. Do everything you can to help them.",
      "14": "Our people must learn to work hard. They must work for what they need and be able to give to others who need help. Then their lives will not be wasted.",
      "15": "All those with me here greet you. Greet my Christian friends there. May you have God’s loving-favor."
