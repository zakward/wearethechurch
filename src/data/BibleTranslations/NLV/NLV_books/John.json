    "1": {
      "1": "The Word (Christ) was in the beginning. The Word was with God. The Word was God.",
      "2": "He was with God in the beginning.",
      "3": "He made all things. Nothing was made without Him making it.",
      "4": "Life began by Him. His Life was the Light for men.",
      "5": "The Light shines in the darkness. The darkness has never been able to put out the Light.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came to tell what he knew about the Light so that all men might believe through him.",
      "8": "John was not the Light, but he was sent to tell about the Light.",
      "9": "This true Light, coming into the world, gives light to every man.",
      "10": "He came into the world. The world was made by Him, but it did not know Him.",
      "11": "He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.",
      "12": "He gave the right and the power to become children of God to those who received Him. He gave this to those who put their trust in His name.",
      "13": "These children of God were not born of blood and of flesh and of man’s desires, but they were born of God.",
      "14": "Christ became human flesh and lived among us. We saw His shining-greatness. This greatness is given only to a much-loved Son from His Father. He was full of loving-favor and truth.",
      "15": "John told about Christ and said, “I have been telling you about this One. I said, ‘He is coming after me. He is more important than I because He lived before me.’”",
      "16": "From Him Who has so much we have all received loving-favor, one loving-favor after another.",
      "17": "The Law was given through Moses, but loving-favor and truth came through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "The much-loved Son is beside the Father. No man has ever seen God. But Christ has made God known to us.",
      "19": "The Jews sent their religious leaders and men from the family group of Levi to ask John, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He told them without holding back any words, “I am not the Christ!”",
      "21": "They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not!” Then they asked, “Are you the special One Who was to come to speak for God?” John said, “No.”",
      "22": "Then they asked him, “Who are you? We must tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "John said, “I am the voice of one crying in the desert. ‘Make the road straight for the Lord,’ as the early preacher Isaiah said.”",
      "24": "Those who had been sent were from the proud religious law-keepers.",
      "25": "They asked John again, “Then why do you baptize if you are not the Christ or Elijah or that special One Who was to come to speak for God?”",
      "26": "John answered, “I baptize with water. But there is One standing among you Whom you do not know.",
      "27": "He is the One Who is coming after me. I am not good enough to get down and help Him take off His shoes.”",
      "28": "All this happened when John was baptizing in the town of Bethany. He was on the other side of the Jordan River.",
      "29": "The next day John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him. He said, “See! The Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "I have been talking about Him. I said, ‘One is coming after me Who is more important than I, because He lived before I was born.’",
      "31": "I did not know who He was, but I have come to baptize with water so the Jews might know about Him.”",
      "32": "Then John said, “I saw the Holy Spirit come down on Jesus as a dove from heaven. The Holy Spirit stayed on Him.",
      "33": "I did not know Him then. But God sent me to baptize with water. God said to me, ‘The Holy Spirit will come down and stay on Him. He is the One Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I saw this happen. I am now saying that Jesus is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "The next day John the Baptist was standing with two of his own followers.",
      "36": "Jesus walked by. John looked at Him and said, “See! The Lamb of God.”",
      "37": "John’s two followers heard him say this and followed Jesus.",
      "38": "Jesus turned around and saw them following. He said to them, “What are you looking for?” They answered, “Teacher, where are you staying?”",
      "39": "He said to them, “Come and see.” They followed Him and saw where He lived. They stayed with Him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.",
      "40": "Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who had heard John’s words and had followed Jesus.",
      "41": "The first thing he did was to find his brother Simon. He said to him, “We have found the Christ!”",
      "42": "Andrew took Simon to Jesus. When Jesus saw Simon, He said, “You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas.” The name Cephas means Peter, or a rock.",
      "43": "The next day Jesus wanted to go to the country of Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow Me.”",
      "44": "Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were from this town also.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law. He is the One the early preachers wrote about. He is Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph.”",
      "46": "Nathanael said, “Can anything good come out of the town of Nazareth?” Philip said, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said, “See! There is a true Jew. There is nothing false in him.”",
      "48": "Nathanael said to Jesus, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip talked to you, I saw you under the fig tree.”",
      "49": "Nathanael said to Him, “Teacher, You are the Son of God. You are the King of the Jews.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Do you believe because I said I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that.",
      "51": "For sure, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and God’s angels going up and coming and down on the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "Three days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there.",
      "2": "Jesus and His followers were asked to come to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine was all gone, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no more wine.”",
      "4": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, what is that to you and to Me. It is not time for Me to work yet.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the helpers, “Do whatever He says.”",
      "6": "Six stone water jars were there. Each one held about one-half barrel of water. These water jars were used in the Jewish worship of washing.",
      "7": "Jesus said to the helpers, “Fill the jars with water.” They filled them to the top.",
      "8": "Then He said, “Take some out and give it to the head man who is caring for the people.” They took some to him.",
      "9": "The head man tasted the water that had become wine. He did not know where it came from but the helpers who took it to him knew. He called the man who had just been married.",
      "10": "The head man said to him, “Everyone puts out his best wine first. After people have had much to drink, he puts out the wine that is not so good. You have kept the good wine until now!”",
      "11": "This was the first powerful work Jesus did. It was done in Cana of Galilee where He showed His power. His followers put their trust in Him.",
      "12": "After this He went down to the city of Capernaum. His mother and brothers and followers went with Him. They stayed there a few days.",
      "13": "It was time for the special religious gathering to remember how the Jews left Egypt. Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "He went into the house of God and found cattle and sheep and doves being sold. Men were sitting there changing money.",
      "15": "Jesus made a whip of small ropes. He used it to make them all leave the house of God along with the sheep and cattle. He pushed their money off the tables and turned the tables over.",
      "16": "He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things out of here! You must not make My Father’s house a place for buying and selling!”",
      "17": "Then His followers remembered that it was written in the Holy Writings, “I am jealous for the honor of Your house.”",
      "18": "Then the Jews asked Him, “What can You do to show us You have the right and the power to do these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this house of God and in three days I will build it again.”",
      "20": "Then the Jews said, “It took forty-six years to build this house of God. Will You build it up in three days?”",
      "21": "Jesus was speaking of His body as the house of God.",
      "22": "After Jesus had been raised from the dead, His followers remembered He said this. They believed the Holy Writings and what He had said.",
      "23": "Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of the special religious gathering to remember how the Jews left Egypt. Many people put their trust in Him when they saw the powerful works He did.",
      "24": "But Jesus did not trust them because He knew all men.",
      "25": "He did not need anyone to tell Him about man. He knew what was in man."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a proud religious law-keeper and a leader of the Jews.",
      "2": "He came to Jesus at night and said, “Teacher, we know You have come from God to teach us. No one can do these powerful works You do unless God is with Him.”",
      "3": "Jesus said to him, “For sure, I tell you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the holy nation of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? How can he get into his mother’s body and be born the second time?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “For sure, I tell you, unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit of God, he cannot get into the holy nation of God.",
      "6": "Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh. Whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "“Do not be surprised that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it wants to and you hear its sound. You do not know where it comes from or where it goes. It is the same with everyone who is born of the Spirit of God.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can this be?”",
      "10": "Jesus said, “Are you a teacher among the Jews and do not know these things?",
      "11": "For sure, I tell you, We are talking about things We know. We tell of what We have seen. Yet you do not take Our words to be true.",
      "12": "I tell you about things of the earth and you do not believe them. How will you believe if I tell you things about heaven?",
      "13": "“No one has gone up into heaven except the One Who came down from heaven. That One is the Son of Man Who is in heaven.",
      "14": "As Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up.",
      "15": "Then whoever puts his trust in Him will have life that lasts forever.",
      "16": "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son. Whoever puts his trust in God’s Son will not be lost but will have life that lasts forever.",
      "17": "For God did not send His Son into the world to say it is guilty. He sent His Son so the world might be saved from the punishment of sin by Him.",
      "18": "Whoever puts his trust in His Son is not guilty. Whoever does not put his trust in Him is guilty already. It is because he does not put his trust in the name of the only Son of God.",
      "19": "“The Light has come into the world. And the Light is the test by which men are guilty or not. People love darkness more than the Light because the things they do are sinful.",
      "20": "Everyone who sins hates the Light. He stays away from the Light because his sin would be found out.",
      "21": "The man who does what is right comes to the Light. What he does will be seen because he has done what God wanted him to do.”",
      "22": "After this, Jesus and His followers came into the country of Judea. He stayed with them there and baptized people.",
      "23": "John was baptizing in the town of Aenon near Salim. There was much water there and people were coming to be baptized.",
      "24": "John had not been put in prison yet.",
      "25": "Then some of the followers of John and a Jew started to argue about the religious washing of the Jewish worship.",
      "26": "They came to John and said to him, “Teacher, the One with you on the other side of the Jordan River is baptizing also. He is the One you told of. Everyone is going to Him.”",
      "27": "John said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
      "28": "You heard the words that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.’",
      "29": "The man who has just been married has the bride. The friend of the man just married stands at his side and listens to him. He has joy when he hears the voice of the man just married. I am full of this joy.",
      "30": "He must become more important. I must become less important.",
      "31": "“He Who comes from above is above all. He who comes from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He Who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "He tells of what He has seen and heard. But no one believes what He says.",
      "33": "Whoever receives His words proves that God is true.",
      "34": "He was sent by God and He speaks God’s Word. God gives Him all of His Spirit.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.",
      "36": "He who puts his trust in the Son has life that lasts forever. He who does not put his trust in the Son will not have life, but the anger of God is on him.”"

      "1": "Jesus knew the proud religious law-keepers had heard He was making and baptizing more followers than John.",
      "2": "Jesus did not baptize anyone Himself but His followers did.",
      "3": "Then Jesus went from the country of Judea to the country of Galilee.",
      "4": "He had to go through the country of Samaria.",
      "5": "So He came to a town in Samaria called Sycar. It was near the piece of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from traveling so He sat down just as He was by the well. It was about noon.",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came to get water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”",
      "8": "His followers had gone to the town to buy food.",
      "9": "The woman of Samaria said to Him, “You are a Jew. I am of Samaria. Why do You ask me for a drink when the Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria?”",
      "10": "Jesus said to her, “You do not know what God has to give. You do not know Who said to you, ‘Give Me a drink.’ If you knew, you would have asked Him. He would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, the well is deep. You have nothing to get water with. Where will You get the living water?",
      "12": "Are You greater than our early father Jacob? He gave us the well. He and his children and his cattle drank from it.”",
      "13": "Jesus said to her, “Whoever drinks this water will be thirsty again.",
      "14": "Whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirsty. The water that I will give him will become in him a well of life that lasts forever.”",
      "15": "The woman said, “Sir, give me this water so I will never be thirsty. Then I will not have to come all this way for water.”",
      "16": "Jesus said to her, “Go call your husband and come back.”",
      "17": "The woman said, “I have no husband.” Jesus said, “You told the truth when you said, ‘I have no husband.’",
      "18": "You have had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband. You told the truth.”",
      "19": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, I think You are a person Who speaks for God.",
      "20": "Our early fathers worshiped on this mountain. You Jews say Jerusalem is the place where men should worship.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me. The time is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You people do not know what you worship. We Jews know what we worship. It is through the Jews that men are saved from the punishment of their sins.",
      "23": "The time is coming, yes, it is here now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. The Father wants that kind of worshipers.",
      "24": "God is Spirit. Those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to Him, “I know the Jews are looking for One Who is coming. He is called the Christ. When He comes, He will tell us everything.”",
      "26": "Jesus said to her, “I am the Christ, the One talking with you!”",
      "27": "Right then the followers came back and were surprised and wondered about finding Him talking with a woman. But no one said, “What do You want?” or, “Why are You talking with her?”",
      "28": "The woman left her water jar and went into the town. She said to the men,",
      "29": "“Come and see a Man Who told me everything I ever did! Can this be the Christ?”",
      "30": "They went out of town and came to Him.",
      "31": "During this time His followers were saying to Him, “Teacher, eat something.”",
      "32": "He said, “I have food to eat that you do not know of.”",
      "33": "The followers said to each other, “Has someone taken food to Him?”",
      "34": "Jesus said, “My food is to do what God wants Me to do and to finish His work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘It is four months yet until the time to gather grain’? Listen! I say to you, open your eyes and look at the fields. They are white now and waiting for the grain to be gathered in.",
      "36": "The one who gathers gets his pay. He gathers fruit that lasts forever. The one who plants and the one who gathers will have joy together.",
      "37": "These words are true, ‘One man plants and another man gathers.’",
      "38": "I sent you to gather where you have not planted. Others have planted and you have come along to gather in their fruit.”",
      "39": "Many people in that town of Samaria believed in Jesus because of what the woman said about Him. She said, “He told me everything I ever did.”",
      "40": "So the people of Samaria came to Him. They asked Him to stay with them. Jesus stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more people believed because of what He said.",
      "42": "They said to the woman, “Now we believe! It is no longer because of what you said about Jesus but we have heard Him ourselves. We know, for sure, that He is the Christ, the One Who saves men of this world from the punishment of their sins.”",
      "43": "Two days later He went from there and came to the country of Galilee.",
      "44": "Jesus Himself said that no one who speaks for God is respected in his own country.",
      "45": "When He came to Galilee, the people there were glad. They had seen all the things He did in Jerusalem. It was at the time of the special religious gathering to remember how the Jews left Egypt. They had been there also.",
      "46": "Jesus came again to the town of Cana of Galilee where He had made water into wine. A man who worked with the king had a son who was sick in the city of Capernaum.",
      "47": "This man went to Jesus. He had heard that Jesus had come from the country of Judea to Galilee. The man asked Jesus if He would go to Capernaum and heal his son who was dying.",
      "48": "Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see special things and powerful works done, you will not believe.”",
      "49": "The man said to Him, “Sir, come with me before my son dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your son will live.” The man put his trust in what Jesus said and left.",
      "51": "As he was on his way home, his servants met him. They said to him, “Your son is living!”",
      "52": "He asked them what time his boy began to get well. They said to him, “Yesterday at one o’clock the sickness left.”",
      "53": "The father knew it was the time Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” He and everyone in his house put their trust in Jesus.",

      "1": "Some time later, there was a religious gathering of the Jews. Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "In Jerusalem there is a pool with five porches called Bethesda near the sheep gate.",
      "3": "Inside these porches lay many sick people. Some were blind. Some could not walk. Some could not move their bodies.",
      "4": "(An angel of the Lord came at certain times and made the water move. All of them were waiting for it to move. Whoever got in the water first after it was moving was healed of whatever sickness he had.)",
      "5": "A man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "Jesus saw him lying there and knew the man had been sick a long time. Jesus said to him, “Would you like to be healed?”",
      "7": "The sick man said, “Sir, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is moving. While I am coming, another one gets in first.”",
      "8": "Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your bed and walk.”",
      "9": "At once the man was healed and picked up his bed and walked. This happened on the Day of Rest.",
      "10": "The Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Day of Rest. It is against the Law for you to carry your bed.”",
      "11": "He said to them, “The Man Who healed me said to me, ‘Pick up your bed and walk.’",
      "12": "Then the Jews asked him, “What man said to you, ‘Pick up your bed and walk’?”",
      "13": "The man who had been healed did not know Who He was. Jesus had gone away while many people were there.",
      "14": "Later Jesus found the man who had been healed in the house of God. He said to him, “Listen! You have been healed. Stop sinning or something worse will come to you.”",
      "15": "The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had healed him.",
      "16": "Because Jesus did these things on the Day of Rest, the Jews made it very hard for Him.",
      "17": "Jesus said to them, “My Father is still working all the time so I am working also.”",
      "18": "The Jews tried all the more to kill Him, not only because He had worked on the Day of Rest, but because He had also called God His Own Father. This made Him the same as God.",
      "19": "Then Jesus said to them, “For sure, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself. He does what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does also.",
      "20": "The Father loves the Son and shows the Son everything He does. The Father will show Him greater works than these. They will surprise you.",
      "21": "The Father raises up the dead and makes them live. The Son also gives life to anyone He chooses.",
      "22": "The Father does not say who is guilty. He gives this to the Son to do.",
      "23": "He does this so that all people will honor the Son as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father Who sent Him.",
      "24": "“For sure, I tell you, anyone who hears My Word and puts his trust in Him Who sent Me has life that lasts forever. He will not be guilty. He has already passed from death into life.",

      "26": "The Father has life in Himself. He has given power to the Son to have life in Himself.",
      "27": "God has given Him the right and the power to say if people are guilty, because He is the Son of Man.",
      "28": "Do not be surprised at this. The time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice.",
      "29": "They will come out. Those who have done good will be raised again and will have new life. Those who have been sinful will be raised again and will be told they are guilty and will be punished.",
      "30": "“I can do nothing by Myself. I say who is guilty only as My Father tells Me. That way, what I say is right, because I am not trying to do what I want to do. I am doing what the Father, Who sent Me, wants Me to do.",
      "31": "If I tell about Myself, My words are worth nothing.",
      "32": "There is another One Who tells about Me. I know the words He says about Me are true.",
      "33": "“You sent to John the Baptist and he told you the truth.",
      "34": "I do not need words from men to say I am right. I say this that you might be saved from the punishment of sin.",
      "35": "John the Baptist was a burning and shining light. You were willing for awhile to be glad in his light.",
      "36": "I have something greater than John which tells of Me. I am doing works the Father has given Me to do and they are proving that the Father has sent Me.",
      "37": "The Father has told of Me and has sent Me. You have never heard His voice. You have never seen Him.",

      "39": "“You do read the Holy Writings. You think you have life that lasts forever just because you read them. They do tell of Me.",
      "40": "But you do not want to come to Me so you might have life.",
      "41": "I do not take any honor from men.",
      "42": "I know you and you do not have the love of God in your hearts.",
      "43": "I have come in the name of My Father. You do not receive Me. If another person comes in his own name, you will receive him.",
      "44": "How can you believe when you are always wanting honor from each other? And yet you do not look for the honor that comes from the only God.",
