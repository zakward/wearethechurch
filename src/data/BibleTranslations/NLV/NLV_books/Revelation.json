    "1": {
      "1": "The things that are written in the Book are made known by Jesus Christ. God gave these things to Christ so He could show them to the servants He owns. These are things which must happen very soon. Christ sent His angel to John who is a servant owned by Him. Christ made these things known to John.",
      "2": "John tells that the Word of God is true. He tells of Jesus Christ and all that he saw and heard of Him.",
      "3": "The man who reads this Book and listens to it being read and obeys what it says will be happy. For all these things will happen soon.",
      "4": "This is John writing to the seven churches in the country of Asia. May you have loving-favor and peace from God Who was and Who is and Who is to come. May you have loving-favor and peace from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.",
      "5": "May you have loving-favor and peace from Jesus Christ Who is faithful in telling the truth. Jesus Christ is the first to be raised from the dead. He is the head over all the kings of the earth. He is the One Who loves us and has set us free from our sins by His blood.",
      "6": "Christ has made us a holy nation of religious leaders who can go to His God and Father. He is the One to receive honor and power forever! Let it be so.",
      "7": "See! He is coming in the clouds. Every eye will see Him. Even the men who killed Him will see Him. All the people on the earth will cry out in sorrow because of Him. Yes, let it be so.",
      "8": "The Lord God says, “I am the First and the Last, the beginning and the end of all things. I am the All-powerful One Who was and Who is and Who is to come.”",
      "9": "I, John, am your Christian brother. I have shared with you in suffering because of Jesus Christ. I have also shared with you His holy nation and we have not given up. I was put on the island called Patmos because I preached the Word of God and told about Jesus Christ.",
      "10": "I was under the Spirit’s power on the Lord’s Day when I heard a loud voice behind me like the loud sound of a horn.",
      "11": "It said, “(I am the First and the Last.) Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches. They are in the cities of Ephesus and Smyrna and Pergamum and Thyatira and Sardis and Philadelphia and Laodicea.”",
      "12": "I turned around to see who was speaking to me. As I turned, I saw seven lights made of gold.",
      "13": "Among the lights stood One Who looked like the Son of Man. He had on a long coat that came to His feet. A belt of gold was around His chest.",
      "14": "His head and His hair were white like white wool. They were as white as snow. His eyes were like fire.",
      "15": "His feet were like shining brass as bright as if it were in a fire. His voice sounded like powerful rushing water.",
      "16": "He held seven stars in His right hand. A sharp sword that cuts both ways came out of His mouth. His face was shining as bright as the sun shines at noon.",
      "17": "When I saw Him, I fell down at His feet like a dead man. He laid His right hand on me and said, “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.",
      "18": "I am the Living One. I was dead, but look, I am alive forever. I have power over death and hell.",
      "19": "So write the things you have seen and the things that are and the things that will happen later.",
      "20": "This is what the seven stars and the seven lights made of gold mean that you saw in My right hand. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The seven lights are the seven churches."

      "1": "“Write this to the angel of the church in the city of Ephesus: ‘The One Who holds the seven stars in His right hand and the One Who walks among the seven lights made of gold, says this:",
      "2": "I know what you have done and how hard you have worked. I know how long you can wait and not give up. I know that you cannot put up with sinful men. I know that you have put men to the test who call themselves missionaries. You have found they are not missionaries but are false.",
      "3": "You have waited long and have not given up. You have suffered because of Me. You have kept going on and have not become tired.",
      "4": "But I have this one thing against you. You do not love Me as you did at first.",
      "5": "Remember how you once loved Me. Be sorry for your sin and love Me again as you did at first. If you do not, I will come to you and take your light out of its place. I will do this unless you are sorry for your sin and turn from it.",
      "6": "But you have this: You hate what the Nicolaitans do. I hate what they do also.",
      "7": "You have ears! Then listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the fruit of the tree of life in the garden of God to everyone who has power and wins.’",

      "9": "I know of your troubles. I know you are poor. But still you are rich! I know the bad things spoken against you by those who say they are Jews. But they are not Jews. They belong to the devil.",
      "10": "Do not be afraid of what you will suffer. Listen! The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you. You will be in trouble for ten days. Be faithful even to death. Then I will give you the crown of life.",
      "11": "You have ears! Then listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The person who has power and wins will not be hurt by the second death!’",
      "12": "“Write this to the angel of the church in the city of Pergamum: ‘The One Who has the sharp sword that cuts both ways, says this:",

      "14": "But I have a few things against you. You have some people who follow the teaching of Balaam. He taught Balak to set a trap for the Jews. He taught them to eat food that had been given as a gift in worship to false gods and to do sex sins.",
      "15": "You also have some who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way.",
      "16": "Be sorry for your sins and turn from them. If you do not, I will come to you right away. I will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.",
      "17": "You have ears! Then listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the hidden bread from heaven to everyone who has power and wins. I will give each of them a white stone also. A new name will be written on it. No one will know the name except the one who receives it!’",
      "18": "“Write this to the angel of the church in the city of Thyatira: ‘The Son of God Who has eyes like fire and Whose feet are like shining brass, says this:",
      "19": "I know what you are doing. I know of your love and faith. I know how you have worked and how you have waited long and have not given up. I know that you are working harder now than you did at first.",
      "20": "But I have this against you: You are allowing Jezebel who calls herself a preacher to teach my servants. She is leading them in the wrong way and they are doing sex sins. And they are eating food that has been given as a gift in worship to false gods.",
      "21": "I gave her time to be sorry for her sins and turn from them. She does not want to turn from her sex sins.",
      "22": "See! I will throw her on a bed. Those who do sex sins with her will suffer much trouble and pain. I will let them suffer unless they are sorry for the sins they have done with her and turn from them.",
      "23": "And I will kill her children. All the churches will know that I am the One Who looks deep into the hearts and minds. I will give you whatever is coming to you because of your work.",
      "24": "But the rest of you there in the city of Thyatira have not followed this false teaching. You have not learned what they call the secrets of Satan. So I will put no other load on you.",
      "25": "But hold on to what you have until I come.",
      "26": "To the one who has power and wins and does what I want him to do, I will give the right and the power over the nations.",
      "27": "He will be leader over them using a piece of iron. And they will be broken in pieces like pots of clay. My Father has given Me this right and power.",
      "28": "And I will give him the Morning Star.",

      "3": "So remember what you have received and heard. Keep it. Be sorry for your sins and turn from them. If you will not wake up, I will come as a robber. You will not know at what time I will come.",
      "4": "But there are a few people in the church in the city of Sardis whose clothes are not dirty with sins. They will walk with Me wearing white clothes. They have done what they should.",
      "5": "Everyone who has power and wins will wear white clothes. I will not take his name from the book of life. I will speak of his name before My Father and His angels.",

      "3": "No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look in it.",

They were given the right and the power to kill one-fourth part of everything on the earth. They were to kill with the sword and by people having no food and by sickness and by the wild animals of the earth.",
      "9": "He broke open the fifth lock. Then I saw under the altar all the souls of those who had been killed for telling the Word of God. They had also been killed for being faithful in telling about Christ.",

They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white clothes and they held branches in their hands.",
      "10": "And they were crying out with a loud voice, “We are saved from the punishment of sin by our God Who sits on the throne and by the Lamb!”",

      "4": "Smoke from burning the special perfume and the prayers of those who belong to God went up before God out of the angel’s hand.",

The heads of the horses looked like the heads of lions. Fire and smoke and sulphur came out of their mouths.",
      "18": "One-third part of all men was killed by the fire and smoke and sulphur that came out of their mouths.",

      "2": "For the way He punishes people is right and true. He has punished the powerful woman who sold the use of her body. She was making the earth sinful with her sex sins. She killed those who worked for God. He has punished her for it.”",
      "3": "Again they said, “Thanks to our God. The smoke from her burning goes up forever.”",

      "10": "Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “No! Do not worship me. I am a servant together with you and your Christian brothers who tell of their trust in Christ. Worship God. For those who speak for Jesus are led in what to say as the early preachers were led.”",

      "20": "The wild animal was taken. The false preacher was taken with it. It was the false preacher who had done powerful works in front of the wild animal. In this way, he fooled those who had received the mark of the wild animal and those who worshiped his false god. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.",

They had not worshiped the wild animal or his false god. They had not received his mark on their foreheads or hands. They lived again and were leaders along with Christ for 1,000 years.",
