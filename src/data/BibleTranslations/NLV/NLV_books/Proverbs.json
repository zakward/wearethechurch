      "1": "These are the wise sayings of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:",
      "2": "They show you how to know wisdom and teaching, to find the words of understanding.",
      "3": "They help you learn about the ways of wisdom and what is right and fair.",
      "4": "They give wisdom to the child-like, and much learning and wisdom to those who are young.",
      "5": "A wise man will hear and grow in learning. A man of understanding will become able",
      "6": "to understand a saying and a picture-story, the words of the wise and what they mean.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of much learning. Fools hate wisdom and teaching.",
      "8": "Hear your father’s teaching, my son, and do not turn away from your mother’s teaching.",
      "9": "For they are a glory to your head and a chain of beauty around your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinners try to lead you into sin, do not go with them.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us. Let us lie in wait to kill someone. Let us set a trap for those who are without blame.",
      "12": "Let us swallow them alive like death, as those who go down to the grave.",
      "13": "We will find all kinds of things of great worth. We will fill our houses with the stolen riches.",
      "14": "Throw in your share with us. We will all have one money bag.”",
      "15": "My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path.",
      "16": "For their feet run to sin and hurry to kill.",
      "17": "Yes, the net is spread for nothing if the bird is watching.",
      "18": "They set traps for their own lives and wait to die.",
      "19": "Such are the ways of all who get things by hurting others. Their desire for stolen riches takes away their own lives.",
      "20": "Wisdom calls out in the street. She lifts her voice in the center of town.",
      "21": "There she cries out in the noisy streets. At the open gates of the city she speaks:",
      "22": "“O foolish ones, how long will you love being foolish? How long will those who laugh at others be happy in their laughing? How long will fools hate much learning?",
      "23": "Listen to my strong words! See, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "I called but you would not listen. I put out my hand and no one gave it a thought.",
      "25": "You did not listen when I told you what you should do, and you would not hear any of my strong words.",
      "26": "So I will laugh at your trouble. I will laugh when you are afraid.",
      "27": "Fear will come to you like a storm. Hard times will come like a strong wind. When trouble and suffering come upon you,",
      "28": "then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will look for me, but they will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated much learning, and did not choose the fear of the Lord.",
      "30": "They would not listen when I told them what they should do. They laughed at all my strong words.",
      "31": "So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own plans.",
      "32": "For the foolish will be killed by their turning away. The trust that fools put in themselves will destroy them.",
      "33": "But he who listens to me will live free from danger, and he will rest easy from the fear of what is sinful.”"

      "7": "He stores up perfect wisdom for those who are right with Him. He is a safe-covering to those who are right in their walk.",
      "8": "He watches over the right way, and He keeps safe the way of those who belong to Him.",
      "9": "Then you will understand what is right and good, and right from wrong, and you will know what you should do.",

      "14": "from the one who is happy doing wrong, and who finds joy in the way of sin.",
      "15": "His ways are not straight and are not good.",
      "16": "You will be saved from the strange woman, from the sinful woman with her smooth words.",
      "17": "She leaves the husband she had when she was young, and forgets the agreement with her God.",
      "18": "For her house goes down to death, and her steps lead to the dead.",
      "19": "None who go to her return again, and they do not find the paths of life.",
      "20": "So may you walk in the way of good men, and keep to the paths of those who are right and good.",
      "21": "For those who are right with God will live in the land. The men without blame will stay in it,",

      "6": "Agree with Him in all your ways, and He will make your paths straight.",
      "7": "Do not be wise in your own eyes. Fear the Lord and turn away from what is sinful.",
      "8": "It will be healing to your body and medicine to your bones.",
      "9": "Honor the Lord with your riches, and with the first of all you grow.",
      "10": "Then your store-houses will be filled with many good things and your barrels will flow over with new wine.",
      "11": "My son, listen when the Lord punishes you. Do not give up when He tells you what you must do.",
      "12": "The Lord punishes everyone He loves. He whips every son He receives.",
      "13": "Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.",
      "14": "For it is better than getting silver and fine gold.",
      "15": "She is worth more than stones of great worth. Nothing you can wish for compares with her.",
      "16": "Long life is in her right hand. Riches and honor are in her left hand.",
      "17": "Her ways are pleasing, and all her paths are peace.",
      "18": "She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her. Happy are all who hold her near.",
      "19": "The Lord built the earth by wisdom. He built the heavens by understanding.",
      "20": "By what He knows, the seas were broken up and water falls from the sky.",
      "21": "My son, do not allow them to leave your eyes. Keep perfect wisdom and careful thinking.",
      "22": "And they will be life to your soul and a chain of beauty to your neck.",
      "23": "Then you will be safe as you walk on your way, and your foot will not trip.",
      "24": "You will not be afraid when you lie down. When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.",
      "25": "Do not be afraid of fear that comes all at once. And do not be afraid of the storm of the sinful when it comes.",
      "26": "For the Lord will be your trust. He will keep your foot from being caught.",
      "27": "Do not keep good from those who should have it, when it is in your power to do it.",
      "28": "Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and return tomorrow, and I will give it,” when you have it with you.",
      "29": "Do not plan for your neighbor to be hurt, while he trusts you enough to live beside you.",
      "30": "Do not fight with a man for no reason, when he has done you no wrong.",
      "31": "Do not be jealous of a man who hurts others, and do not choose any of his ways.",
      "32": "For the bad man is hated by the Lord, but He is near to those who are right with Him.",
      "33": "The punishment of the Lord is on the house of the sinful, but He makes good come to the house of those who are right with Him.",
      "34": "God makes fun of those who make fun of the truth but gives loving-favor to those who have no pride.",

      "6": "Do not leave her alone, and she will keep you safe. Love her, and she will watch over you.",
      "7": "The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom! And with all you have gotten, get understanding.",
      "8": "Honor her and she will honor you. She will honor you if you hold her to your heart.",
      "9": "She will put on your head a crown of loving-favor and beauty.”",

      "16": "For they cannot sleep unless they do wrong. They are robbed of sleep unless they make someone fall.",
      "17": "For they eat the bread of sin, and drink the wine of wrong-doing.",
      "18": "But the way of those who are right is like the early morning light. It shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.",
      "19": "The way of the sinful is like darkness. They do not know what they trip over.",

      "20": "My son, why should you be carried away with a sinful woman and fall into the arms of a strange woman?",

      "25": "Do not desire her beauty in your heart. Do not let her catch you with her eyes.",
      "26": "For because of a woman who sells the use of her body, one is brought down to a loaf of bread. A sinful woman hunts to take a man’s very life.",

      "32": "He who does sex sins with a woman does not think well. He who does it is destroying himself.",
      "33": "He will be hurt and ashamed, and his shame will not be taken away.",
