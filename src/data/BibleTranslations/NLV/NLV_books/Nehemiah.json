      "1": "These are the words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.\nNow in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in the king’s house in Susa,",
      "2": "Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came. I asked them about the Jews who were still living and had gotten away from Babylon, and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They said to me, “The Jews who are left who have returned to the land from Babylon are in much trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are destroyed by fire.”",
      "4": "When I heard this, I sat down and cried and was filled with sorrow for days. I did not eat, and I prayed to the God of heaven.",
      "5": "I said, “O Lord God of heaven, the great God Who is honored with fear, Who keeps the agreement and loving-kindness for those who love Him and keep His Laws,",
      "6": "listen to me and let Your eyes be open. Hear the prayer of Your servant which I now pray to You day and night for the sons of Israel Your servants, telling the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You. I and my father’s house have sinned.",
      "7": "We have sinned in our actions against You. We have not kept the Laws which You gave to Your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Remember what You told Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are not faithful, I will make you go different places in other nations.",
      "9": "But if you return to Me and keep My Laws and obey them, I will gather you and bring you to the place where I have chosen for My name to be. I will do this even if you have been spread out to the farthest part of the heavens.’",
      "10": "They are Your servants and Your people whom You have made free by Your great power and strong hand.",
      "11": "O Lord, hear the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who are happy to fear Your name. Make Your servant do well today, and give him loving-pity in front of this man.”\nNow I was the one who carried the cup for the king."

      "1": "In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, wine was in front of him. And I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in front of him before.",
      "2": "So the king said to me, “Why is your face so sad when you are not sick? It must be that you are sad in your heart.” Then I was very much afraid.",
      "3": "I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ graves, lies waste and its gates destroyed by fire?”",
      "4": "Then the king said to me, “What are you asking for?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.",
      "5": "And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your eyes, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ graves. Let me build it again.”",
      "6": "The king said to me, with the queen sitting beside him, “How long will you be gone, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time.",

These will be for making heavy wood pieces for the gates of the strong place by the house of God, and for the city wall, and for the house where I will stay.” And the king gave me what I asked for, because the good hand of my God was upon me.",
      "9": "Then I came to the leaders of the lands on the other side of the River and gave them the letters. Now the king had sent army captains and horsemen with me.",
      "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite workman heard about it, they were not pleased that someone had come to make things go well for the sons of Israel.",
      "11": "I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.",
      "12": "Then I got up in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me except the one I was sitting on.",
      "13": "I went out at night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon’s Well and to the Waste Gate. I looked at the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were destroyed by fire.",
      "14": "Then I went on to the Well Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal I was on to pass.",
      "15": "So I went up in the night by the valley and looked at the wall. Then I went in through the Valley Gate again and returned.",
      "16": "The leaders did not know where I had gone or what I had done. And I had not yet told the Jews, the religious leaders, the rulers, the leaders, or the rest who did the work.",
      "17": "Then I said to them, “You see the problem we have. Jerusalem lies waste and its gates are destroyed by fire. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem again, that we may no longer be put to shame.”",
      "18": "I told them how the hand of my God had brought good to me, and the words that the king had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us get up and build.” So they put their hands to the good work.",
      "19": "But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they made fun of us and hated us. They said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you turning against the king?”",
      "20": "I answered them, “The God of heaven will make it go well for us. So we His servants will get up and build. But you have no share or right or anything to be remembered in Jerusalem.”"

      "20": "In whatever place you hear the sound of the horn, gather together to us there. Our God will fight for us.”",
      "21": "So we did the work with half of them holding spears from sunrise until the stars came out.",

      "3": "And some said, “We are giving up our fields, our grape-vines and our houses, that we might get grain because of no food.”",
      "4": "Others said, “We have taken money from others to pay the king’s tax on our fields and our grape-vines, and we must pay back this money.",
      "5": "Our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers. Our children are like their children. Yet we are made to sell our sons and daughters to work for others. Some of our daughters have already been sold and taken away. We cannot do anything, because our fields and vines belong to others.”",
      "6": "I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.",
      "7": "I thought about it, and spoke sharp words to the rulers and leaders. I said to them, “You are making the people pay back more money than you give them to use!” So I gathered many people together against them.",
      "8": "And I said to them, “As we have been able, we have bought and freed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations. But you would even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us!” They were quiet and could not find a word to say.",
      "9": "So I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to stop the nations who hate us from putting us to shame?",
      "10": "I, my brothers and my servants are giving them money and grain. Let us stop making them pay back more than they are given.",
      "11": "Return to them this very day their fields, vines, olive trees, and houses. Also return to them one-hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine, and oil, that you have been making them pay.”",
      "12": "Then they said, “We will give these back and will ask nothing from them. We will do just as you say.” So I called the religious leaders, and had them promise that they would keep their word.",
      "13": "I shook out the front of my clothing and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house and from all he has worked for, who does not keep this promise. So may he be shaken out and made empty.” And all the people said, “Let it be so!” and praised the Lord. Then they did as they had promised.",
      "14": "Also, in the twelve years after I was chosen to be their ruler in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, I and my brothers did not eat the food allowed to the ruler.",
      "15": "The rulers who were before me made the people work very hard. They took bread and wine from them, besides forty pieces of silver. Even their servants ruled over the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.",
      "16": "I also worked on this wall myself, and we did not buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there for the work.",
      "17": "Also, there were 150 Jews and leaders at my table, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.",
      "18": "One bull, six of the best sheep, and birds were made ready for me each day. All kinds of wine were brought in every ten days. Yet for all this I did not make them give me the food allowed to me as ruler, because the work was very hard for these people.",

      "2": "So Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to hurt or kill me.",
      "3": "So I sent men with word to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”",
      "4": "They sent word to me four times in this way, and I gave them the same answer.",
      "5": "Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way for a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written, “It is said among the nations, and Gashmu says that you and the Jews are planning to turn against the king. This is why you are building the wall again. It is said that you wish to be their king.",
      "7": "You have also chosen men who tell what will happen to speak to the people in Jerusalem about you, saying, ‘A king is in Judah!’ Now this will be told to the king. So come now, let us meet to speak with each other.”",
      "8": "Then I sent word to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done. You are making them up in your own mind.”",
      "9": "For they all wanted to make us afraid, thinking, “Their hands will become weak and the work will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands.",

      "11": "But I said, “Should a man like me run away? And could a man such as I go into the house of God to save his life? I will not go in.”",
      "12": "Then I understood that God had not sent him. He had spoken these words against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to do it.",
      "13": "He had been paid to try to make me afraid and to do as he said and sin, so they would have sinful things to say about me and put me to shame.",
      "14": "O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat by these works of theirs. And remember Noadiah and the rest of the men who tell what will happen who were trying to make me afraid.",
      "15": "So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, in fifty-two days.",
      "16": "When all those who hated us heard about it, all the nations around us were afraid and troubled. For they saw that this work had been done with the help of our God.",
      "17": "In those days the rulers of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.",
      "18": "For many in Judah were joined by promise to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah. And his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah.",

For Judah was filled with joy because of the religious leaders and Levites who did the work.",
