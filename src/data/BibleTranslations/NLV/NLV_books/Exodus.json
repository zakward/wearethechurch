      "19": "But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except by a powerful hand.",
      "20": "So I will put out My hand and trouble Egypt with all the powerful works I will do there. After that he will let you go.",

      "10": "Moses said to the Lord, “Lord, I am not a man of words. I have never been. Even now since You spoke to Your servant, I still am not. For I am slow in talking and it is difficult for me to speak.”",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Who makes a man not able to speak or hear? Who makes one blind or able to see? Is it not I, the Lord?",
