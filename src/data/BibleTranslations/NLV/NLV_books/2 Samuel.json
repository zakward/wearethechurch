      "5": "David said to the young man, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "The young man said, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. There I saw Saul holding himself up with his spear. The war-wagons and the horsemen were coming close after him.",
      "7": "When he looked behind him, he saw me. He called to me and I said, ‘Here I am.’",
      "8": "He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",

      "23": "But he would not turn aside. So Abner hit him in the stomach with the end of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. He fell there and died where he fell. And all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died, stood still.",
      "24": "But Joab and Abishai went after Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the way of the desert of Gibeon.",
      "25": "The sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one army. They stood on the top of a hill.",
      "26": "Abner called to Joab and said, “Should the sword destroy forever? Do you not know that it will be bad in the end? How long will you keep from telling the people to stop following their brothers?”",
      "27": "Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, for sure the people would have stopped going after their brothers in the morning.”",
      "28": "So Joab sounded the horn, and all the people stopped and went after Israel no longer. And they did not fight any more.",

      "8": "Abner was very angry because of Ish-bosheth’s words, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the family of your father Saul, to his brothers and to his friends. I have not given you into David’s hands. Yet today you say I am guilty because of this woman.",
      "9": "May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David what the Lord has promised him.",

      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so they may make an agreement with you. Then you may be king over all your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",

      "23": "When Joab and the army with him came, it was told to Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king. And the king has sent him away in peace.”",
      "24": "Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? See, Abner came to you. Why then have you sent him away, so that he is gone?",
      "25": "You know Abner the son of Ner. He came to fool you, and to learn about your going out and coming in. He came to learn all that you are doing.”",
      "26": "When Joab left David, he sent men after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.",
      "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the center of the gate to speak with him alone. There Joab hit him in the stomach and killed him because of the blood of his brother Asahel.",
      "28": "When David heard about it, he said, “I and my nation are forever without guilt before the Lord, from the blood of Abner the son of Ner.",
      "29": "May the guilt be on the head of Joab and all his father’s family. May the family of Joab never be without one who has a flow from his body, or a bad skin disease, or the need to use a walking stick. Or may his family never be without one who falls by the sword, or who needs more bread.”",
      "30": "So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother in the battle at Gibeon.",

      "32": "They buried Abner in Hebron. And the king cried in a loud voice at Abner’s grave. All the people cried.",
      "33": "The king sang a song of sorrow for Abner, saying, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?",
      "34": "Your hands were not tied. Your feet were not put in chains. You have fallen as one falls in front of the sinful.” And all the people cried again over him.",
      "35": "Then all the people came to try to talk David into eating bread while it was still day. But David promised, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.”",
      "36": "All the people saw it, and it pleased them. Everything the king did pleased all the people.",

      "38": "Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a leader, and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?",

We must put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.’ So I would be without a son to receive what belonged to his parents when I die. They would put out the last of the fire which is left to me. My husband would be left without a name and with no children on the earth.”",
