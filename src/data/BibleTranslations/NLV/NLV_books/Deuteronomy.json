      "3": "On the first day of the eleventh month in the fortieth year, Moses spoke to the children of Israel. He told them all the Lord said they must do.",
      "4": "This was after he had won the war against Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.",
      "5": "On the other side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses talked to the people about this Law. He said,",
      "6": "“The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Sinai, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.",
      "7": "Get ready to travel now. Go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the valley, in the Negev and by the sea, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the big river, the river Euphrates.",

      "41": "“Then you said to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God told us.’ So every man of you put on his sword and thought it an easy thing to go up into the hill country.",
      "42": "The Lord said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up or fight. For I am not among you. You would be destroyed by those who hate you.”’",
      "43": "So I spoke to you but you would not listen. You went against what the Lord told you. In your pride you went up into the hill country.",
      "44": "Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you. They came at you like bees, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah.",

      "25": "This day I will begin to put much fear of you upon the nations everywhere under the heavens. When they hear about you, they will shake with fear and be filled with trouble because of you.’",
      "26": "“So I sent men carrying news from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace. They said,",
      "27": "‘Let me pass through your land. I will travel only on the road. I will not turn to the right or to the left.",
      "28": "You will sell me food for money so I may eat, and give me water for money so I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot",
      "29": "as the sons of Esau did for us in Seir and the Moabites in Ar. Do this until I cross over the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.’",
      "30": "But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us pass through his land. For the Lord your God made his spirit and heart hard, so He might give him into your hand, as he is today.",
      "31": "Then the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take it for your own, so you may live in it.’",
      "32": "“Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.",
