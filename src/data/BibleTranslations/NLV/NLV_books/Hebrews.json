      "1": "Long ago God spoke to our early fathers in many different ways. He spoke through the early preachers.",
      "2": "But in these last days He has spoken to us through His Son. God gave His Son everything. It was by His Son that God made the world.",
      "3": "The Son shines with the shining-greatness of the Father. The Son is as God is in every way. It is the Son Who holds up the whole world by the power of His Word. The Son gave His own life so we could be clean from all sin. After He had done that, He sat down on the right side of God in heaven.",
      "4": "The Son of God was made greater and better than the angels. God gave Him a greater name than theirs.",
      "5": "God did not say to any of His angels, “You are My Son. Today I have become Your Father.” And He did not say to any angel, “I will be a Father to Him. He will be a Son to Me.”",
      "6": "But when God brought His first-born Son, Jesus, into the world, He said, “Let all the angels of God worship Him.”",
      "7": "He said this about the angels, “He makes His angels to be winds. He makes His servants a burning fire.”",
      "8": "But about His Son, He says, “O God, Your throne will last forever. Whatever You say in Your nation is right and good.",
      "9": "You have loved what is right. You have hated what is wrong. That is why God, Your God, has chosen You. He has poured over You the oil of joy more than over anyone else.”",
      "10": "He said also, “Lord, You made the earth in the beginning. You made the heavens with Your hands.",
      "11": "They will be destroyed but You will always be here. They will all become old just as clothes become old.",
      "12": "You will roll up the heavens like a coat. They will be changed. But You are always the same. You will never grow old.”",
      "13": "God never said to any angel, “Sit at My right side, until I make those who hate You a place to rest Your feet.”",
      "14": "Are not all the angels spirits who work for God? They are sent out to help those who are to be saved from the punishment of sin."

      "1": "That is why we must listen all the more to the truths we have been told. If we do not, we may slip away from them.",
      "2": "These truths given by the angels proved to be true. People were punished when they did not obey them.",
      "3": "God was so good to make a way for us to be saved from the punishment of sin. What makes us think we will not go to hell if we do not take the way to heaven that He has made for us? The Lord was the first to tell us of this. Then those who heard Him told it later.",
      "4": "God proved what they said was true by showing us special things to see and by doing powerful works. He gave the gifts of the Holy Spirit as He wanted to.",
      "5": "God did not make angels to be the leaders of that world to come which we have been speaking about.",
      "6": "Instead, the Holy Writings say, “What is man that You think of him and the son of man that You should remember him?”",
      "7": "“You made him so he took a place that was not as important as the angels for a little while. You gave him the crown of honor and shining-greatness. You made him the head over everything You have made.",
      "8": "You have put everything under his feet.” There is nothing that does not obey him, but we do not see all things obey him yet.",
      "9": "But we do see Jesus. For a little while He took a place that was not as important as the angels. But God had loving-favor for everyone. He had Jesus suffer death on a cross for all of us. Then, because of Christ’s death on a cross, God gave Him the crown of honor and shining-greatness.",
      "10": "God made all things. He made all things for Himself. It was right for God to make Jesus a perfect Leader by having Him suffer for men’s sins. In this way, He is bringing many men to share His shining-greatness.",
      "11": "Jesus makes men holy. He takes away their sins. Both Jesus and the ones being made holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them His brothers.",
      "12": "Jesus is saying to His Father, “I will tell My brothers Your name. I will sing songs of thanks for You among the people.”",
      "13": "And again He says, “I will put My trust in God.” At another time He said, “Here I am with the children God gave Me.”",
      "14": "It is true that we share the same Father with Jesus. And it is true that we share the same kind of flesh and blood because Jesus became a man like us. He died as we must die. Through His death He destroyed the power of the devil who has the power of death.",
      "15": "Jesus did this to make us free from the fear of death. We no longer need to be chained to this fear.",
      "16": "Jesus did not come to help angels. Instead, He came to help men who are of Abraham’s family.",
      "17": "So Jesus had to become like His brothers in every way. He had to be one of us to be our Religious Leader to go between God and us. He had loving-pity on us and He was faithful. He gave Himself as a gift to die on a cross for our sins so that God would not hold these sins against us any longer.",
      "18": "Because Jesus was tempted as we are and suffered as we do, He understands us and He is able to help us when we are tempted."

      "3": "The man who builds a house gets more honor than the house. That is why Jesus gets more honor than Moses.",
      "4": "Every house is built by someone. And God is the One Who has built everything.",
      "5": "Moses was a faithful servant owned by God in God’s house. He spoke of the things that would be told about later on.",
      "6": "But Christ was faithful as a Son Who is Head of God’s house. We are of God’s house if we keep our trust in the Lord until the end. This is our hope.",
      "7": "The Holy Spirit says, “If you hear His voice today,",
      "8": "do not let your hearts become hard as your early fathers did when they turned against Me. It was at that time in the desert when they put Me to the test.",
      "9": "Your early fathers tempted Me and tried Me. They saw the work I did for forty years.",
      "10": "For this reason, I was angry with the people of this day. And I said to them, ‘They always think wrong thoughts. They have never understood what I have tried to do for them.’",
      "11": "I was angry with them and said to Myself, ‘They will never go into My rest.’”",
      "12": "Christian brothers, be careful that not one of you has a heart so bad that it will not believe and will turn away from the living God.",
      "13": "Help each other. Speak day after day to each other while it is still today so your heart will not become hard by being fooled by sin.",
      "14": "For we belong to Christ if we keep on trusting Him to the end just as we trusted Him at first.",
      "15": "The Holy Writings say, “If you hear His voice today, do not let your hearts become hard as your early fathers did when they turned against Me.”",
      "16": "Who heard God’s voice and turned against Him? Did not all those who were led out of the country of Egypt by Moses?",
      "17": "Who made God angry for forty years? Was it not those people who had sinned in the desert? Was it not those who died and were buried there?",
      "18": "Who did He say could never go into His rest? Was it not those who did not obey Him?",
      "19": "So we can see that they were not able to go into His rest because they did not put their trust in Him."

      "3": "We who have put our trust in God go into His rest. God said this of our early fathers, “I was angry and said, ‘They will not go into My rest.’” And yet God’s work was finished after He made the world.",
      "4": "In the Holy Writings He said this about the seventh day when He made the whole world, “God rested on the seventh day from all He had made.”",
      "5": "But God said this about those who turned against Him, “They will not go into My rest.”",
      "6": "Those who heard the Good News first did not go into His rest. It was because they had not obeyed Him. But the promise is still good and some are going into His rest.",
      "7": "God has again set a certain day for people to go into His rest. He says through David many years later as He had said before, “If you hear His voice today, do not let your hearts become hard.”",
      "8": "If Joshua had led those people into God’s rest, He would not have told of another day after that.",
      "9": "And so God’s people have a complete rest waiting for them.",
      "10": "The man who goes into God’s rest, rests from his own work the same as God rested from His work.",
      "11": "Let us do our best to go into that rest or we will be like the people who did not go in.",
      "12": "God’s Word is living and powerful. It is sharper than a sword that cuts both ways. It cuts straight into where the soul and spirit meet and it divides them. It cuts into the joints and bones. It tells what the heart is thinking about and what it wants to do.",
      "13": "No one can hide from God. His eyes see everything we do. We must give an answer to God for what we have done.",
      "14": "We have a great Religious Leader Who has made the way for man to go to God. He is Jesus, the Son of God, Who has gone to heaven to be with God. Let us keep our trust in Jesus Christ.",
      "15": "Our Religious Leader understands how weak we are. Christ was tempted in every way we are tempted, but He did not sin.",

      "2": "A Jewish religious leader is weak in many ways because he is just a man himself. He knows how to be gentle with those who know little. He knows how to help those who are doing wrong.",
      "3": "Because he is weak himself, he must give gifts to God for his own sins as well as for the sins of the people.",
      "4": "A Jewish religious leader does not choose this honor for himself. God chooses a man for this work. Aaron was chosen this way.",
      "5": "It is the same way with Christ. He did not choose the honor of being a Religious Leader Who has made the way for man to go to God. Instead, God said to Christ, “You are My Son. Today I have become Your Father.”",
      "6": "God says in another part of His Word, “You will be a Religious Leader forever. You will be like Melchizedek.”",
      "7": "During the time Jesus lived on earth, He prayed and asked God with loud cries and tears. Jesus’ prayer was to God Who was able to save Him from death. God heard Christ because Christ honored God.",
      "8": "Even being God’s Son, He learned to obey by the things He suffered.",

      "12": "By now you should be teachers. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the first things you need to know from God’s Word. You still need milk instead of solid food.",
      "13": "Anyone who lives on milk cannot understand the teaching about being right with God. He is a baby.",

We do not need to teach these first truths again. You already know that you must be sorry for your sins and turn from them. You know that you must have faith in God.",

      "5": "They know how good the Word of God is. They know of the powers of the world to come.",
      "6": "But if they turn away, they cannot be sorry for their sins and turn from them again. It is because they are nailing the Son of God on a cross again. They are holding Him up in shame in front of all people.",
      "7": "It is the same with a piece of ground that has had many rains fall on it. God makes it possible for that ground to give good fruits and vegetables.",
      "8": "But if it gives nothing but weeds, it is worth nothing. It will be hated and destroyed by fire.",
      "9": "Dear friends, even as we tell you this, we are sure of better things for you. These things go along with being saved from the punishment of sin.",
      "10": "God always does what is right. He will not forget the work you did to help the Christians and the work you are still doing to help them. This shows your love for Christ.",
      "11": "We want each one of you to keep on working to the end. Then what you hope for, will happen.",
      "12": "Do not be lazy. Be like those who have faith and have not given up. They will receive what God has promised them.",

      "15": "Abraham was willing to wait and God gave to him what He had promised.",
      "16": "When men make a promise, they use a name greater than themselves. They do this to make sure they will do what they promise. In this way, no one argues about it.",
      "17": "And so God made a promise. He wanted to show Abraham that He would never change His mind. So He made the promise in His own name.",
      "18": "God gave these two things that cannot be changed and God cannot lie. We who have turned to Him can have great comfort knowing that He will do what He has promised.",
      "19": "This hope is a safe anchor for our souls. It will never move. This hope goes into the Holiest Place of All behind the curtain of heaven.",

      "2": "Abraham gave Melchizedek one-tenth part of all he had. Melchizedek’s name means king of what is right. Salem means peace. So he is king of peace.",
      "3": "Melchizedek was without a father or mother or any family. He had no beginning of life or end of life. He is a religious leader forever like the Son of God.",
      "4": "We can see how great Melchizedek was. Abraham gave him one-tenth part of all he had taken in the war.",
      "5": "The Law made the family of Levi the Jewish religious leaders. The Law said that the religious leaders were to take one-tenth part of everything from their own people.",
      "6": "Melchizedek was not even from the family group of Levi but Abraham paid him. Melchizedek showed respect to Abraham who was the one who had received God’s promises.",
      "7": "The one who shows respect is always greater than the one who receives it.",
      "8": "Jewish religious leaders receive one-tenth part. They are men and they all die. But here Melchizedek received one-tenth part and is alive.",

      "10": "Levi was not yet born. He was still inside Abraham’s body when Abraham paid Melchizedek.",
      "11": "The Law was given during the time when Levi and his sons were the religious leaders. If the work of those religious leaders had been perfect in taking away the sins of the people, there would have been no need for another religious leader. But one like Melchizedek was needed and not one from the family group of Aaron.",

      "15": "We can see that a different Religious Leader has come. This One is like Melchizedek.",
      "16": "Christ did not become a Religious Leader by coming from the family group of Levi as the Law said had to be. He became the Religious Leader by the power of a life that never ends.",
      "17": "The Holy Writings say this about Christ, “You are a Religious Leader forever like Melchizedek.”",
      "18": "God put the Law of Moses aside. It was weak and could not be used.",
      "19": "For the Law of Moses could not make men right with God. Now there is a better hope through which we can come near to God.",
      "20": "God made a promise when Christ became the Religious Leader Who made the way for man to go to God.",
      "21": "God did not make such a promise when Levi’s family group became religious leaders. But when Christ became a Religious Leader, this is the promise God made, “The Lord has made a promise. He will never change His mind. You will be a Religious Leader forever.”",

      "25": "And so Jesus is able, now and forever, to save from the punishment of sin all who come to God through Him because He lives forever to pray for them.",
      "26": "We need such a Religious Leader Who made the way for man to go to God. Jesus is holy and has no guilt. He has never sinned and is different from sinful men. He has the place of honor above the heavens.",
      "27": "Christ is not like other religious leaders. They had to give gifts every day on the altar in worship for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. Christ did not have to do that. He gave one gift on the altar and that gift was Himself. It was done once and it was for all time.",
      "28": "The Law makes religious leaders of men. These men are not perfect. After the Law was given, God spoke with a promise. He made His Son a perfect Religious Leader forever."

      "3": "Every religious leader of the Old Way of Worship had the work of killing animals and of giving gifts on the altar to God. So Christ had to have something to give also.",
      "4": "If Christ were on the earth, He would not be a religious leader such as these. The religious leaders on earth give gifts like the Law says.",

      "9": "The New Way of Worship will not be like the Old Way of Worship I gave to their early fathers. That was when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. But they did not follow the Old Way of Worship. And so I turned away from them.",
      "10": "This is the New Way of Worship that I will give to the Jews. When that day comes, says the Lord, I will put My Laws into their minds. And I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people.",
      "11": "No one will need to teach his neighbor or his brother to know the Lord. All of them will already know Me from the least to the greatest.",

      "4": "In the inside tent there was an altar where special perfume was burned. There was also a large box made of wood called the box of the Way of Worship. Both of these were covered with gold inside and out. Inside the box was a pot made of gold with the bread from heaven. It also had in it Aaron’s stick that once started to grow. The stones on which the Law of Moses was written were in it.",
      "5": "Above the box were the cherubim of honor. Their wings were spread up and over and met in the center. On the top of the box and under the shadow of their wings was the mercy-seat. We cannot tell anymore about these things now.",

      "7": "Once each year the head religious leader would go into the inside tent alone. He would not go in without blood. He gave this blood to God as a gift in worship for his own sins and for the sins of all the people who sinned without knowing it.",
      "8": "And so the Holy Spirit is teaching that, with the Old Way of Worship, the people could not go into the Holiest Place of All as long as the outside tent and its Old Way of Worship were being used.",
      "9": "The outside tent is a picture of that day. With the Old Way of Worship, animals killed and gifts given in worship to God could not take away the guilty feeling of sin.",
      "10": "The Old Way of Worship was made up of Laws about what to eat and drink. These Laws told how to wash and other things to do with the body. These things had to be done until Christ came to bring a better way of worship.",
      "11": "But Christ came as the Head Religious Leader of the good things God promised. He made the way for man to go to God. He was a greater and more perfect tent. He was not made by human hands and was not a part of this earth.",
      "12": "Christ went into the Holiest Place of All one time for all people. He did not take the blood of goats and young cows to give to God as a gift in worship. He gave His own blood. By doing this, He bought us with His own blood and made us free from sin forever.",
      "13": "With the Old Way of Worship, the blood and ashes of animals could make men clean after they had sinned.",
      "14": "How much more the blood of Christ will do! He gave Himself as a perfect gift to God through the Spirit that lives forever. Now your heart can be free from the guilty feeling of doing work that is worth nothing. Now you can work for the living God.",
      "15": "Christ is the One Who gave us this New Way of Worship. All those who have been called by God may receive life that lasts forever just as He promised them. Christ bought us with His blood when He died for us. This made us free from our sins which we did under the Old Way of Worship.",
      "16": "When a man wants to give his money to someone after he dies, he writes it all down on paper. But that paper is worth nothing until the man is dead.",
      "17": "That piece of paper means nothing as long as he is alive. It is good only when he dies.",
      "18": "The Old Way of Worship had to have a death to make it good. The blood of an animal was used.",
      "19": "Moses told the people all the things they had to obey in the Law. Then he took the blood of animals together with water and put it on the Book of the Law and on all the people. He used special branches and red wool as he put it on them.",
      "20": "Moses said, “This is the blood of the Way of Worship which God said you must obey.”",
      "21": "In the same way, Moses put the blood on the tent and on all the things used in worship.",
      "22": "The Law says that almost everything is made clean by blood. Sins are not forgiven unless blood is given.",
      "23": "The tent to worship in and the things inside to worship with were like the things in heaven. They were made clean by putting blood on them. But the things in heaven were made clean by a much better gift of worship.",
      "24": "For Christ did not go into the Holiest Place of All that was made by men, even if it was like the true one in heaven. He went to heaven itself and He is before God for us.",
      "25": "Christ has not given Himself many times, as the head religious leader here on earth went into the Holiest Place of All each year with blood that was not his own.",
      "26": "For then Christ would have had to die many times since the world began. But He came once at the end of the Old Way of Worship. He gave Himself once for all time. He gave Himself to destroy sin.",
      "27": "It is in the plan that all men die once. After that, they will stand before God and be judged.",
      "28": "It is the same with Christ. He gave Himself once to take away the sins of many. When He comes the second time, He will not need to give Himself again for sin. He will save all those who are waiting for Him."

How much more will he be punished if he acts as if the blood of God’s New Way of Worship is worth nothing? This New Way of Worship is God’s way of making him holy. How much more will he be punished if he laughs at the Holy Spirit Who wanted to show him loving-favor?",
