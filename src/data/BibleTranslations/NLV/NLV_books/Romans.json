      "1": "This letter is from Paul. I am a servant owned by Jesus Christ and a missionary chosen by God to preach His Good News.",
      "2": "The Good News was promised long ago by God’s early preachers in His Holy Writings.",
      "3": "It tells of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who was born as a person in the flesh through the family of King David.",
      "4": "The Holy Spirit proved by a powerful act that Jesus our Lord is the Son of God because He was raised from the dead.",
      "5": "Jesus has given us His loving-favor and has made us His missionaries. We are to preach to the people of all nations that they should obey Him and put their trust in Him.",
      "6": "You have been chosen to belong to Jesus Christ also.",
      "7": "So I write to all of you in the city of Rome. God loves you and has chosen you to be set apart for Himself. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you His loving-favor and peace.",
      "8": "First of all, I keep thanking my God, through Jesus Christ, for all of you. This is because the whole world knows of your faith in Christ.",
      "9": "God knows how I work for Him. He knows how I preach with all my heart the Good News about His Son. He knows how I always pray for you.",
      "10": "I pray that I might be able to visit you, if God wants me to.",
      "11": "I want to see you so I can share some special gift of the Holy Spirit with you. It will make you strong.",
      "12": "Both of us need help. I can help make your faith strong and you can do the same for me. We need each other.",
      "13": "Christian brothers, many times I have wanted to visit you. Something has kept me from going until now. I have wanted to lead some of you to Christ also, as I have done in other places where they did not know God.",
      "14": "I must help the people who have had a chance to hear the Good News and those who have not. I must help those with much learning and those who have never learned from books.",
      "15": "So I want to preach the Good News to you who live in Rome also.",
      "16": "I am not ashamed of the Good News. It is the power of God. It is the way He saves men from the punishment of their sins if they put their trust in Him. It is for the Jew first and for all other people also.",
      "17": "The Good News tells us we are made right with God by faith in Him. Then, by faith we live that new life through Him. The Holy Writings say, “A man right with God lives by faith.”",
      "18": "We see the anger of God coming down from heaven against all the sins of men. These sinful men keep the truth from being known.",
      "19": "Men know about God. He has made it plain to them.",
      "20": "Men cannot say they do not know about God. From the beginning of the world, men could see what God is like through the things He has made. This shows His power that lasts forever. It shows that He is God.",
      "21": "They did know God, but they did not honor Him as God. They were not thankful to Him and thought only of foolish things. Their foolish minds became dark.",
      "22": "They said that they were wise, but they showed how foolish they were.",
      "23": "They gave honor to false gods that looked like people who can die and to birds and animals and snakes. This honor belongs to God Who can never die.",
      "24": "So God let them follow the desires of their sinful hearts. They did sinful things among themselves with their bodies.",
      "25": "They traded the truth of God for a lie. They worshiped and cared for what God made instead of worshiping the God Who made it. He is the One Who is to receive honor and thanks forever. Let it be so.",
      "26": "Because of this, God let them follow their sinful desires which lead to shame. Women used their bodies in ways God had not planned.",
      "27": "In the same way, men left the right use of women’s bodies. They did sex sins with other men. They received for themselves the punishment that was coming to them for their sin.",
      "28": "Because they would not keep God in their thoughts anymore, He gave them up. Their minds were sinful and they wanted only to do things they should not do.",
      "29": "They are full of everything that is sinful and want things that belong to others. They hate people and are jealous. They kill other people. They fight and lie. They do not like other people and talk against them.",
      "30": "They talk about people, and they hate God. They are filled with pride and tell of all the good they do. They think of new ways to sin. They do not obey their parents.",
      "31": "They are not able to understand. They do not do what they say they will do. They have no love and no loving-pity.",
      "32": "They know God has said that all who do such things should die. But they keep on doing these things and are happy when others do them also."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "So you can say nothing because you are guilty when you say someone else is guilty. While you say someone is guilty, you are doing the same things he does.",
      "2": "We know that God will say those who do such things are guilty.",
      "3": "Do you think God will punish others for doing wrong and let you keep sinning?",
      "4": "Do you forget about His loving-kindness to you? Do you forget how long He is waiting for you? You know that God is kind. He is trying to get you to be sorry for your sins and turn from them.",
      "5": "Because you are not sorry for your sins and will not turn from them, you will be punished even more on the day of God’s anger. God will be right in saying you are guilty.",
      "6": "He will give to every man what he should get for the things he has done.",
      "7": "Those who keep on doing good and are looking for His greatness and honor will receive life that lasts forever.",
      "8": "Those who love only themselves and do not obey the truth, but do what is wrong, will be punished by God. His anger will be on them.",
      "9": "Every Jew and every person who is not a Jew who sins will suffer and have great sorrow.",
      "10": "But God will give His greatness and honor and peace to all those who obey the truth. Both Jews and those who are not Jews will receive this.",
      "11": "God does not show favor to one man more than to another.",
      "12": "Those who have sinned without having the Law will be lost without the Law being used. Those who have the Law and have sinned will be judged by the Law.",
      "13": "Just to hear the Law does not make a man right with God. The man right with God is the one who obeys the Law.",
      "14": "The people who are not Jews do not have the Law. When they do what the Law tells them to do, even if they do not have the Law, it shows they know what they should do.",
      "15": "They show that what the Law wants them to do is written in their hearts. Their own hearts tell them if they are guilty.",
      "16": "There will be a day when God will judge because He knows the secret thoughts of men. He will do this through Jesus Christ. This is part of the Good News I preach.",
      "17": "You are a Jew and think you are safe because of the Law. You tell others about how you know God.",
      "18": "You know what He wants you to do. You understand how the Law works. You know right from wrong.",
      "19": "You think you can lead a blind man. You think you can give light to those in darkness.",
      "20": "You think you can teach foolish people and children about God. You have in the Law the plan of truth and wisdom.",
      "21": "You teach others. Why do you not teach yourselves? You tell others not to steal. Do you steal?",
      "22": "You say that no one should do sex sins. Do you do sex sins? You hate false gods. Do you rob the houses where they are kept?",
      "23": "You are proud of the Law. Do you take honor away from God when you do not obey the Law?",
      "24": "The Holy Writings say, “God’s name is hated by the people who are not Jews because of you.”",
      "25": "Going through the religious act of becoming a Jew is worth something if you obey the Law. If you do not obey the Law, it is worth nothing to you.",
      "26": "If a person who is not a Jew and has not gone through the act of becoming a Jew, obeys the Law, God will think of him as a Jew.",
      "27": "You Jews have the Law but do not obey it. You have gone through the religious act also. At the same time those who are not Jews obey the Law even if they have not gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew. In this way, these people show you are guilty.",
      "28": "A man is not a Jew just because he goes through the religious act of becoming a Jew.",
      "29": "The true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. The religious act of becoming a Jew must be done in the heart. That is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Law does not do that kind of work. The true Jew gets his thanks from God, not from men."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Do the Jews have anything that those who are not Jews do not have? What good does it do to go through the religious act of becoming a Jew?",
      "2": "Yes, the Jews have much more in every way. First of all, God gave the Jews His Law.",
      "3": "If some of them were not faithful, does it mean that God will not be faithful?",
      "4": "No, not at all! God is always true even if every man lies. The Holy Writings say, “Speak the truth and you will not be proven guilty.”",
      "5": "If our sins show how right God is, what can we say? Is it wrong for God to punish us for it? (I am speaking as men do.)",
      "6": "No, not at all! If it were wrong for God to punish us, how could He judge the world?",
      "7": "If my lies honor God by showing how true He is, why am I still being judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "Why not say, “Let us sin that good will come from it.” (Some people have said I talk like this!) They will be punished as they should be.",
      "9": "What about it then? Are we Jews better than the people who are not Jews? Not at all! I have already said that Jews and the people who are not Jews are all sinners.",
      "10": "The Holy Writings say, “There is not one person who is right with God. No, not even one!",
      "11": "There is not one who understands. There is not one who tries to find God.”",
      "12": "Everyone has turned away from God. They have all done wrong. Not one of them does what is good. No, not even one!",
      "13": "Their mouth is like an open grave. They tell lies with their tongues. Whatever they say is like the poison of snakes.",
      "14": "Their mouths speak bad things against God. They say bad things about other people.",
      "15": "They are quick to hurt and kill people.",
      "16": "Wherever they go, they destroy and make people suffer.",
      "17": "They know nothing about peace.",
      "18": "They do not honor God with love and fear.”",
      "19": "Now we know that the Law speaks to those who live under the Law. No one can say that he does not know what sin is. Yes, every person in the world stands guilty before God.",
      "20": "No person will be made right with God by doing what the Law says. The Law shows us how sinful we are.",
      "21": "But now God has made another way to make men right with Himself. It is not by the Law. The Law and the early preachers tell about it.",
      "22": "Men become right with God by putting their trust in Jesus Christ. God will accept men if they come this way. All men are the same to God.",
      "23": "For all men have sinned and have missed the shining-greatness of God.",
      "24": "Anyone can be made right with God by the free gift of His loving-favor. It is Jesus Christ Who bought them with His blood and made them free from their sins.",
      "25": "God gave Jesus Christ to the world. Men’s sins can be forgiven through the blood of Christ when they put their trust in Him. God gave His Son Jesus Christ to show how right He is. Before this, God did not look on the sins that were done.",
      "26": "But now God proves that He is right in saving men from sin. He shows that He is the One Who has no sin. God makes anyone right with Himself who puts his trust in Jesus.",
      "27": "What then do we have to be proud of? Nothing at all! Why? Is it because men obey the Law? No! It is because men put their trust in Christ.",
      "28": "This is what we have come to know. A man is made right with God by putting his trust in Christ. It is not by his doing what the Law says.",
      "29": "Is God the God of the Jews only? Is He not the God of the people who are not Jews also? He is for sure.",
      "30": "He is one God. He will make Jews and the people who are not Jews right with Himself if they put their trust in Christ.",
      "31": "Does this mean that we do away with the Law when we put our trust in Christ? No, not at all. It means we know the Law is important."

    "4": {
      "1": "What about Abraham, our early father? What did he learn?",
      "2": "If Abraham was made right with God by what he did, he would have had something to be proud of. But he could not be proud before God.",
      "3": "The Holy Writings say, “Abraham put his trust in God and that made him right with God.”",
      "4": "If a man works, his pay is not a gift. It is something he has earned.",
      "5": "If a man has not worked to be saved, but has put his trust in God Who saves men from the punishment of their sins, that man is made right with God because of his trust in God.",
      "6": "David tells of this. He spoke of how happy the man is who puts his trust in God without working to be saved from the punishment of sin.",
      "7": "“Those people are happy whose sinful acts are forgiven and whose sins are covered.",
      "8": "Those people are happy whose sins the Lord will not remember.”",
      "9": "Is this happiness given to the Jews only? Or is it given also to the people who are not Jews? We say again, “Abraham put his trust in God and that made him right with God.”",
      "10": "When did this happen? Was it before or after Abraham went through the religious act of becoming a Jew? It was before.",
      "11": "He went through the religious act after he had put his trust in God. That religious act proved that his trust in God made him right with God even before he went through the religious act of becoming a Jew. In that way, it made him the early father of all those who believe. It showed that those who did not go through the religious act of becoming a Jew could be right with God.",
      "12": "He is also the early father of all those who have gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew. It is not because they went through the act. It is because they put their trust in God the same as Abraham did before he went through the religious act of becoming a Jew.",
      "13": "God promised to give the world to him and to all his family after him. He did not make this promise because Abraham obeyed the Law. He promised to give the world to Abraham because he put his trust in God. This made him right with God.",
      "14": "If those who obey the Law are to get the world, then a person putting his trust in God means nothing. God’s promise to Abraham would be worth nothing.",
      "15": "God’s anger comes on a man when he does not obey the Law. But if there were no Law, then no one could break it.",
      "16": "So God’s promise is given to us because we put our trust in Him. We can be sure of it. It is because of His loving-favor to us. It is for all the family of Abraham. It is for those who obey the Law. It is for those who put their trust in God as Abraham did. In this way, he is the father of all Christians.",
      "17": "The Holy Writings say, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This promise is good because of Who God is. He makes the dead live again. He speaks, and something is made out of nothing.",
      "18": "Abraham believed he would be the father of many nations. He had no reason to hope for this, but he had been told, “Your children will become many nations.”",
      "19": "Abraham was about one hundred years old. His body was about dead, but his faith in God was not weak when he thought of his body. His faith was not weak when he thought of his wife Sarah being past the age of having children.",
      "20": "Abraham did not doubt God’s promise. His faith in God was strong, and he gave thanks to God.",
      "21": "He was sure God was able to do what He had promised.",
      "22": "Abraham put his trust in God and was made right with Him.",
      "23": "The words, “He was made right with God,” were not for Abraham only.",
      "24": "They were for us also. God will make us right with Himself the same way He did Abraham, if we put our trust in God Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.",
      "25": "Jesus died for our sins. He was raised from the dead to make us right with God."

      "3": "We are glad for our troubles also. We know that troubles help us learn not to give up.",
      "4": "When we have learned not to give up, it shows we have stood the test. When we have stood the test, it gives us hope.",
      "5": "Hope never makes us ashamed because the love of God has come into our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who was given to us.",
      "6": "We were weak and could not help ourselves. Then Christ came at the right time and gave His life for all sinners.",
      "7": "No one is willing to die for another person, but for a good man someone might be willing to die.",
      "8": "But God showed His love to us. While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
      "9": "Now that we have been saved from the punishment of sin by the blood of Christ, He will save us from God’s anger also.",
      "10": "We hated God. But we were saved from the punishment of sin by the death of Christ. He has brought us back to God and we will be saved by His life.",
      "11": "Not only that, we give thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Him we have been brought back to God.",
      "12": "This is what happened: Sin came into the world by one man, Adam. Sin brought death with it. Death spread to all men because all have sinned.",
      "13": "Sin was in the world before the Law was given. But sin is not held against a person when there is no Law.",
      "14": "And yet death had power over men from the time of Adam until the time of Moses. Even the power of death was over those who had not sinned in the same way Adam sinned. Adam was like the One Who was to come.",
      "15": "God’s free gift is not like the sin of Adam. Many people died because of the sin of this one man, Adam. But the loving-favor of God came to many people also. This gift came also by one Man Jesus Christ, God’s Son.",
      "16": "The free gift of God is not like Adam’s sin. God told Adam he was guilty because of his sin and through this one came sin and guilt. But the free gift makes men right with God. Through One, Christ, men’s sins are forgiven.",
      "17": "The power of death was over all men because of the sin of one man, Adam. But many people will receive His loving-favor and the gift of being made right with God. They will have power in life by Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "Through Adam’s sin, death and hell came to all men. But another Man, Christ, by His right act makes men free and gives them life.",
      "19": "Adam did not obey God, and many people become sinners through him. Christ obeyed God and makes many people right with Himself.",
      "20": "Sin spread when the Law was given. But where sin spread, God’s loving-favor spread all the more.",
      "21": "Sin had power that ended in death. Now, God’s loving-favor has power to make men right with Himself. It gives life that lasts forever. Our Lord Jesus Christ did this for us."

      "2": "No, not at all! We are dead to sin. How then can we keep on living in sin?",
      "3": "All of us were baptized to show we belong to Christ. We were baptized first of all to show His death.",
      "4": "We were buried in baptism as Christ was buried in death. As Christ was raised from the dead by the great power of God, so we will have new life also.",
      "5": "If we have become one with Christ in His death, we will be one with Him in being raised from the dead to new life.",
      "6": "We know that our old life, our old sinful self, was nailed to the cross with Christ. And so the power of sin that held us was destroyed. Sin is no longer our boss.",
      "7": "When a man is dead, he is free from the power of sin.",
      "8": "And if we have died with Christ, we believe we will live with Him also.",
      "9": "We know that Christ was raised from the dead. He will never die again. Death has no more power over Him.",
      "10": "He died once but now lives. He died to break the power of sin, and the life He now lives is for God.",
      "11": "You must do the same thing! Think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin. But now you have new life because of Jesus Christ our Lord. You are living this new life for God.",
      "12": "So do not let sin have power over your body here on earth. You must not obey the body and let it do what it wants to do.",
      "13": "Do not give any part of your body for sinful use. Instead, give yourself to God as a living person who has been raised from the dead. Give every part of your body to God to do what is right.",
      "14": "Sin must not have power over you. You are not living by the Law. You have life because of God’s loving-favor.",
      "15": "What are we to do then? Are we to sin because we have God’s loving-favor and are not living by the Law? No, not at all!",
      "16": "Do you not know that when you give yourself as a servant to be owned by someone, that one becomes your owner? If you give yourself to sin, the end is death. If you give yourself to God, the end is being right with Him.",
      "17": "At one time you were held by the power of sin. But now you obey with all your heart the teaching that was given to you. Thank God for this!",
      "18": "You were made free from the power of sin. Being right with God has power over you now.",
      "19": "I speak with words easy to understand because your human thinking is weak. At one time you gave yourselves over to the power of sin. You kept on sinning all the more. Now give yourselves over to being right with God. Set yourself apart for God-like living and to do His work.",
      "20": "When sin had power over your life, you were not right with God.",
      "21": "What good did you get from the things you are ashamed of now? Those things bring death.",
      "22": "But now you are free from the power of sin. You have become a servant for God. Your life is set apart for God-like living. The end is life that lasts forever.",

      "3": "If she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is sinning by not being faithful in marriage. If her husband dies, she is free from the law that joined her to him. After that she can marry someone else. She does not sin if she marries another man.",
