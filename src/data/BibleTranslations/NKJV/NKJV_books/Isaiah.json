      "2": "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth!\nFor the Lord has spoken:\n“I have nourished and brought up children,\nAnd they have rebelled against Me;",
      "3": "The ox knows its owner\nAnd the donkey its master’s crib;\nBut Israel does not know,\nMy people do not consider.”",
      "4": "Alas, sinful nation,\nA people laden with iniquity,\nA brood of evildoers,\nChildren who are corrupters!\nThey have forsaken the Lord,\nThey have provoked to anger\nThe Holy One of Israel,\nThey have turned away backward.",
      "5": "Why should you be stricken again?\nYou will revolt more and more.\nThe whole head is sick,\nAnd the whole heart faints.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head,\nThere is no soundness in it,\nBut wounds and bruises and putrefying sores;\nThey have not been closed or bound up,\nOr soothed with ointment.",
      "7": "Your country is desolate,\nYour cities are burned with fire;\nStrangers devour your land in your presence;\nAnd it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.",

      "28": "The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together,\nAnd those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.",
