  "Obadiah": {
    "1": {
      "1": "The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom\n(We have heard a report from the Lord,\nAnd a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying,\n“Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle”):",
      "2": "“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;\nYou shall be greatly despised.",
      "3": "The pride of your heart has deceived you,\nYou who dwell in the clefts of the rock,\nWhose habitation is high;\nYou who say in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’",
      "4": "Though you ascend as high as the eagle,\nAnd though you set your nest among the stars,\nFrom there I will bring you down,” says the Lord.",
      "5": "“If thieves had come to you,\nIf robbers by night—\nOh, how you will be cut off!—\nWould they not have stolen till they had enough?\nIf grape-gatherers had come to you,\nWould they not have left some gleanings?",
      "6": "“Oh, how Esau shall be searched out!\nHow his hidden treasures shall be sought after!",
      "7": "All the men in your confederacy\nShall force you to the border;\nThe men at peace with you\nShall deceive you and prevail against you.\nThose who eat your bread shall lay a trap for you.\nNo one is aware of it.",
      "8": "“Will I not in that day,” says the Lord,\n“Even destroy the wise men from Edom,\nAnd understanding from the mountains of Esau?",
      "9": "Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,\nTo the end that everyone from the mountains of Esau\nMay be cut off by slaughter.",
      "10": "“For violence against your brother Jacob,\nShame shall cover you,\nAnd you shall be cut off forever.",
      "11": "In the day that you stood on the other side—\nIn the day that strangers carried captive his forces,\nWhen foreigners entered his gates\nAnd cast lots for Jerusalem—\nEven you were as one of them.",
      "12": "“But you should not have gazed on the day of your brother\nIn the day of his captivity;\nNor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah\nIn the day of their destruction;\nNor should you have spoken proudly\nIn the day of distress.",
      "13": "You should not have entered the gate of My people\nIn the day of their calamity.\nIndeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction\nIn the day of their calamity,\nNor laid hands on their substance\nIn the day of their calamity.",
      "14": "You should not have stood at the crossroads\nTo cut off those among them who escaped;\nNor should you have delivered up those among them who remained\nIn the day of distress.",
      "15": "“For the day of the Lord upon all the nations is near;\nAs you have done, it shall be done to you;\nYour reprisal shall return upon your own head.",
      "16": "For as you drank on My holy mountain,\nSo shall all the nations drink continually;\nYes, they shall drink, and swallow,\nAnd they shall be as though they had never been.",
      "17": "“But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance,\nAnd there shall be holiness;\nThe house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.",
      "18": "The house of Jacob shall be a fire,\nAnd the house of Joseph a flame;\nBut the house of Esau shall be stubble;\nThey shall kindle them and devour them,\nAnd no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau,”\nFor the Lord has spoken.",
      "19": "The South shall possess the mountains of Esau,\nAnd the Lowland shall possess Philistia.\nThey shall possess the fields of Ephraim\nAnd the fields of Samaria.\nBenjamin shall possess Gilead.",
      "20": "And the captives of this host of the children of Israel\nShall possess the land of the Canaanites\nAs far as Zarephath.\nThe captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\nShall possess the cities of the South.",
      "21": "Then saviors shall come to Mount Zion\nTo judge the mountains of Esau,\nAnd the kingdom shall be the Lord’s."
