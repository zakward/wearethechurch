      "4": "“I will stretch out My hand against Judah,\nAnd against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\nI will cut off every trace of Baal from this place,\nThe names of the idolatrous priests with the pagan priests—",
      "5": "Those who worship the host of heaven on the housetops;\nThose who worship and swear oaths by the Lord,\nBut who also swear by Milcom;",

      "10": "“And there shall be on that day,” says the Lord,\n“The sound of a mournful cry from the Fish Gate,\nA wailing from the Second Quarter,\nAnd a loud crashing from the hills.",
      "11": "Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh!\nFor all the merchant people are cut down;\nAll those who handle money are cut off.",
      "12": "“And it shall come to pass at that time\nThat I will search Jerusalem with lamps,\nAnd punish the men\nWho are settled in complacency,\nWho say in their heart,\n‘The Lord will not do good,\nNor will He do evil.’",
      "13": "Therefore their goods shall become booty,\nAnd their houses a desolation;\nThey shall build houses, but not inhabit them;\nThey shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.”",
      "14": "The great day of the Lord is near;\nIt is near and hastens quickly.\nThe noise of the day of the Lord is bitter;\nThere the mighty men shall cry out.",
      "15": "That day is a day of wrath,\nA day of trouble and distress,\nA day of devastation and desolation,\nA day of darkness and gloominess,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness,",
      "16": "A day of trumpet and alarm\nAgainst the fortified cities\nAnd against the high towers.",

      "12": "“You Ethiopians also,\nYou shall be slain by My sword.”",
      "13": "And He will stretch out His hand against the north,\nDestroy Assyria,\nAnd make Nineveh a desolation,\nAs dry as the wilderness.",
      "14": "The herds shall lie down in her midst,\nEvery beast of the nation.\nBoth the pelican and the bittern\nShall lodge on the capitals of her pillars;\nTheir voice shall sing in the windows;\nDesolation shall be at the threshold;\nFor He will lay bare the cedar work.",
      "15": "This is the rejoicing city\nThat dwelt securely,\nThat said in her heart,\n“I am it, and there is none besides me.”\nHow has she become a desolation,\nA place for beasts to lie down!\nEveryone who passes by her\nShall hiss and shake his fist."
