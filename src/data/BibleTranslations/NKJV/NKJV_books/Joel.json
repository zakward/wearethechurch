      "1": "The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.",
      "2": "Hear this, you elders,\nAnd give ear, all you inhabitants of the land!\nHas anything like this happened in your days,\nOr even in the days of your fathers?",
      "3": "Tell your children about it,\nLet your children tell their children,\nAnd their children another generation.",
      "4": "What the chewing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten;\nWhat the swarming locust left, the crawling locust has eaten;\nAnd what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten.",
      "5": "Awake, you drunkards, and weep;\nAnd wail, all you drinkers of wine,\nBecause of the new wine,\nFor it has been cut off from your mouth.",
      "6": "For a nation has come up against My land,\nStrong, and without number;\nHis teeth are the teeth of a lion,\nAnd he has the fangs of a fierce lion.",
      "7": "He has laid waste My vine,\nAnd ruined My fig tree;\nHe has stripped it bare and thrown it away;\nIts branches are made white.",
      "8": "Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth\nFor the husband of her youth.",
      "9": "The grain offering and the drink offering\nHave been cut off from the house of the Lord;\nThe priests mourn, who minister to the Lord.",
      "10": "The field is wasted,\nThe land mourns;\nFor the grain is ruined,\nThe new wine is dried up,\nThe oil fails.",
      "11": "Be ashamed, you farmers,\nWail, you vinedressers,\nFor the wheat and the barley;\nBecause the harvest of the field has perished.",
      "12": "The vine has dried up,\nAnd the fig tree has withered;\nThe pomegranate tree,\nThe palm tree also,\nAnd the apple tree—\nAll the trees of the field are withered;\nSurely joy has withered away from the sons of men.",
      "13": "Gird yourselves and lament, you priests;\nWail, you who minister before the altar;\nCome, lie all night in sackcloth,\nYou who minister to my God;\nFor the grain offering and the drink offering\nAre withheld from the house of your God.",
      "14": "Consecrate a fast,\nCall a sacred assembly;\nGather the elders\nAnd all the inhabitants of the land\nInto the house of the Lord your God,\nAnd cry out to the Lord.",
      "15": "Alas for the day!\nFor the day of the Lord is at hand;\nIt shall come as destruction from the Almighty.",
      "16": "Is not the food cut off before our eyes,\nJoy and gladness from the house of our God?",
      "17": "The seed shrivels under the clods,\nStorehouses are in shambles;\nBarns are broken down,\nFor the grain has withered.",
      "18": "How the animals groan!\nThe herds of cattle are restless,\nBecause they have no pasture;\nEven the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.",
      "19": "O Lord, to You I cry out;\nFor fire has devoured the open pastures,\nAnd a flame has burned all the trees of the field.",
      "20": "The beasts of the field also cry out to You,\nFor the water brooks are dried up,\nAnd fire has devoured the open pastures."

      "1": "Blow the trumpet in Zion,\nAnd sound an alarm in My holy mountain!\nLet all the inhabitants of the land tremble;\nFor the day of the Lord is coming,\nFor it is at hand:",
      "2": "A day of darkness and gloominess,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness,\nLike the morning clouds spread over the mountains.\nA people come, great and strong,\nThe like of whom has never been;\nNor will there ever be any such after them,\nEven for many successive generations.",
      "3": "A fire devours before them,\nAnd behind them a flame burns;\nThe land is like the Garden of Eden before them,\nAnd behind them a desolate wilderness;\nSurely nothing shall escape them.",
      "4": "Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;\nAnd like swift steeds, so they run.",
      "5": "With a noise like chariots\nOver mountaintops they leap,\nLike the noise of a flaming fire that devours the stubble,\nLike a strong people set in battle array.",
      "6": "Before them the people writhe in pain;\nAll faces are drained of color.",
      "7": "They run like mighty men,\nThey climb the wall like men of war;\nEvery one marches in formation,\nAnd they do not break ranks.",
      "8": "They do not push one another;\nEvery one marches in his own column.\nThough they lunge between the weapons,\nThey are not cut down.",
      "9": "They run to and fro in the city,\nThey run on the wall;\nThey climb into the houses,\nThey enter at the windows like a thief.",
      "10": "The earth quakes before them,\nThe heavens tremble;\nThe sun and moon grow dark,\nAnd the stars diminish their brightness.",
      "11": "The Lord gives voice before His army,\nFor His camp is very great;\nFor strong is the One who executes His word.\nFor the day of the Lord is great and very terrible;\nWho can endure it?",
      "12": "“Now, therefore,” says the Lord,\n“Turn to Me with all your heart,\nWith fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.”",
      "13": "So rend your heart, and not your garments;\nReturn to the Lord your God,\nFor He is gracious and merciful,\nSlow to anger, and of great kindness;\nAnd He relents from doing harm.",
      "14": "Who knows if He will turn and relent,\nAnd leave a blessing behind Him—\nA grain offering and a drink offering\nFor the Lord your God?",
      "15": "Blow the trumpet in Zion,\nConsecrate a fast,\nCall a sacred assembly;",
      "16": "Gather the people,\nSanctify the congregation,\nAssemble the elders,\nGather the children and nursing babes;\nLet the bridegroom go out from his chamber,\nAnd the bride from her dressing room.",
      "17": "Let the priests, who minister to the Lord,\nWeep between the porch and the altar;\nLet them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord,\nAnd do not give Your heritage to reproach,\nThat the nations should rule over them.\nWhy should they say among the peoples,\n‘Where is their God?’ ”",
      "18": "Then the Lord will be zealous for His land,\nAnd pity His people.",
      "19": "The Lord will answer and say to His people,\n“Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil,\nAnd you will be satisfied by them;\nI will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.",
      "20": "“But I will remove far from you the northern army,\nAnd will drive him away into a barren and desolate land,\nWith his face toward the eastern sea\nAnd his back toward the western sea;\nHis stench will come up,\nAnd his foul odor will rise,\nBecause he has done monstrous things.”",
      "21": "Fear not, O land;\nBe glad and rejoice,\nFor the Lord has done marvelous things!",
      "22": "Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field;\nFor the open pastures are springing up,\nAnd the tree bears its fruit;\nThe fig tree and the vine yield their strength.",
      "23": "Be glad then, you children of Zion,\nAnd rejoice in the Lord your God;\nFor He has given you the former rain faithfully,\nAnd He will cause the rain to come down for you—\nThe former rain,\nAnd the latter rain in the first month.",
      "24": "The threshing floors shall be full of wheat,\nAnd the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.",
      "25": "“So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,\nThe crawling locust,\nThe consuming locust,\nAnd the chewing locust,\nMy great army which I sent among you.",
      "26": "You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,\nAnd praise the name of the Lord your God,\nWho has dealt wondrously with you;\nAnd My people shall never be put to shame.",
      "27": "Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel:\nI am the Lord your God\nAnd there is no other.\nMy people shall never be put to shame.",
      "28": "“And it shall come to pass afterward\nThat I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh;\nYour sons and your daughters shall prophesy,\nYour old men shall dream dreams,\nYour young men shall see visions.",
      "29": "And also on My menservants and on My maidservants\nI will pour out My Spirit in those days.",
      "30": "“And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:\nBlood and fire and pillars of smoke.",
      "31": "The sun shall be turned into darkness,\nAnd the moon into blood,\nBefore the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.",
      "32": "And it shall come to pass\nThat whoever calls on the name of the Lord\nShall be saved.\nFor in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance,\nAs the Lord has said,\nAmong the remnant whom the Lord calls."

      "1": "“For behold, in those days and at that time,\nWhen I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,",
      "2": "I will also gather all nations,\nAnd bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat;\nAnd I will enter into judgment with them there\nOn account of My people, My heritage Israel,\nWhom they have scattered among the nations;\nThey have also divided up My land.",
      "3": "They have cast lots for My people,\nHave given a boy as payment for a harlot,\nAnd sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.",
      "4": "“Indeed, what have you to do with Me,\nO Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia?\nWill you retaliate against Me?\nBut if you retaliate against Me,\nSwiftly and speedily I will return your retaliation upon your own head;",
      "5": "Because you have taken My silver and My gold,\nAnd have carried into your temples My prized possessions.",
      "6": "Also the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem\nYou have sold to the Greeks,\nThat you may remove them far from their borders.",
      "7": "“Behold, I will raise them\nOut of the place to which you have sold them,\nAnd will return your retaliation upon your own head.",

      "11": "Assemble and come, all you nations,\nAnd gather together all around.\nCause Your mighty ones to go down there, O Lord.",
      "12": "“Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat;\nFor there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.",
      "13": "Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.\nCome, go down;\nFor the winepress is full,\nThe vats overflow—\nFor their wickedness is great.”",

      "15": "The sun and moon will grow dark,\nAnd the stars will diminish their brightness.",
      "16": "The Lord also will roar from Zion,\nAnd utter His voice from Jerusalem;\nThe heavens and earth will shake;\nBut the Lord will be a shelter for His people,\nAnd the strength of the children of Israel.",
      "17": "“So you shall know that I am the Lord your God,\nDwelling in Zion My holy mountain.\nThen Jerusalem shall be holy,\nAnd no aliens shall ever pass through her again.”",
      "18": "And it will come to pass in that day\nThat the mountains shall drip with new wine,\nThe hills shall flow with milk,\nAnd all the brooks of Judah shall be flooded with water;\nA fountain shall flow from the house of the Lord\nAnd water the Valley of Acacias.",
      "19": "“Egypt shall be a desolation,\nAnd Edom a desolate wilderness,\nBecause of violence against the people of Judah,\nFor they have shed innocent blood in their land.",
