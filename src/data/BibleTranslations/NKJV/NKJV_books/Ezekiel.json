      "5": "Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.",
      "6": "Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.",

      "11": "Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies.",
      "12": "And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went.",
      "13": "As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning.",

      "18": "As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.",
      "19": "When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.",
      "20": "Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",

      "23": "And under the firmament their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body.",
      "24": "When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.",
      "25": "A voice came from above the firmament that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.",
      "26": "And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.",
      "27": "Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.",
      "28": "Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.\nSo when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking."

      "9": "Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”",

      "13": "I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise.",
      "14": "So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.",
      "15": "Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.",
      "16": "Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
      "17": "“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:",
      "18": "When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.",
      "19": "Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.",
      "20": "“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.",
      "21": "Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.”",
      "22": "Then the hand of the Lord was upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.”",

      "26": "I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.",
      "27": "But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house."
