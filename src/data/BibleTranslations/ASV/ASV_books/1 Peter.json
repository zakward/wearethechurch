      "6": "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,",
      "7": "that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:",

      "12": "To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.",
      "13": "Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;",

      "22": "who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:",

      "4": "but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.",
      "5": "For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:",
