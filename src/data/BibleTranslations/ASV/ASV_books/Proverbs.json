      "22": "How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?\nAnd scoffers delight them in scoffing,\nAnd fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "Turn you at my reproof:\nBehold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;\nI will make known my words unto you.",
      "24": "Because I have called, and ye have refused;\nI have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;",
