      "6": "For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands,",
      "7": "for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;",
      "8": "therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do thou suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,",
      "9": "who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,",
      "10": "and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,",

      "24": "and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,",
      "25": "in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,",
