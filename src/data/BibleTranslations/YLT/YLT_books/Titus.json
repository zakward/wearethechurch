      "11": "whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.",
      "12": "A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'",
      "13": "this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,",
      "14": "not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;",

      "14": "who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;",
      "15": "these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!"

      "2": "of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,",
      "3": "for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;",

      "9": "and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.",
      "10": "A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,",
      "11": "having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.",
      "12": "When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.",
      "13": "Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,",
      "14": "and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.",
      "15": "Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace [is] with you all!"
