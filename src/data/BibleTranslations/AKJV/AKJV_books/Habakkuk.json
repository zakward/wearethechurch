      "2": "O Lord, how long shall I cry,\nand thou wilt not hear!\neven cry out unto thee of violence,\nand thou wilt not save!",
      "3": "Why dost thou shew me iniquity,\nand cause me to behold grievance?\nfor spoiling and violence are before me:\nand there are that raise up strife and contention.",
      "4": "Therefore the law is slacked,\nand judgment doth never go forth:\nfor the wicked doth compass about the righteous;\ntherefore wrong judgment proceedeth.",
      "5": "Behold ye among the heathen,\nand regard, and wonder marvellously:\nfor I will work a work in your days,\nwhich ye will not believe, though it be told you.",
      "6": "For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,\nwhich shall march through the breadth of the land,\nto possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.",
      "7": "They are terrible and dreadful:\ntheir judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.",

      "10": "And they shall scoff at the kings,\nand the princes shall be a scorn unto them:\nthey shall deride every strong hold;\nfor they shall heap dust, and take it.",
      "11": "Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over,\nand offend, imputing this his power unto his god.",
      "12": "Art thou not from everlasting,\nO Lord my God, mine Holy One?\nwe shall not die.\nO Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment;\nand, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.",
      "13": "Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil,\nand canst not look on iniquity:\nwherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,\nand holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?",
      "14": "And makest men as the fishes of the sea,\nas the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?",
      "15": "They take up all of them with the angle,\nthey catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag:\ntherefore they rejoice and are glad.",
      "16": "Therefore they sacrifice unto their net,\nand burn incense unto their drag;\nbecause by them their portion is fat,\nand their meat plenteous.",
      "17": "Shall they therefore empty their net,\nand not spare continually to slay the nations?"

      "5": "Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,\nneither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell,\nand is as death, and cannot be satisfied,\nbut gathereth unto him all nations,\nand heapeth unto him all people:",
      "6": "shall not all these take up a parable against him,\nand a taunting proverb against him,\nand say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long?\nand to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!",
      "7": "Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee,\nand awake that shall vex thee,\nand thou shalt be for booties unto them?",
      "8": "Because thou hast spoiled many nations,\nall the remnant of the people shall spoil thee;\nbecause of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land,\nof the city, and of all that dwell therein.",

      "11": "For the stone shall cry out of the wall,\nand the beam out of the timber shall answer it.",
      "12": "Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood,\nand stablisheth a city by iniquity!",
      "13": "Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire,\nand the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?",

      "18": "What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it;\nthe molten image, and a teacher of lies,\nthat the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?",
      "19": "Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake;\nto the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach!\nBehold, it is laid over with gold and silver,\nand there is no breath at all in the midst of it.",

      "5": "Before him went the pestilence,\nand burning coals went forth at his feet.",
      "6": "He stood, and measured the earth:\nhe beheld, and drove asunder the nations;\nand the everlasting mountains were scattered,\nthe perpetual hills did bow:\nhis ways are everlasting.",
      "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:\nand the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.",
      "8": "Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?\nwas thine anger against the rivers?\nwas thy wrath against the sea,\nthat thou didst ride upon thine horses\nand thy chariots of salvation?",
      "9": "Thy bow was made quite naked,\naccording to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah.\nThou didst cleave the earth with rivers.",
      "10": "The mountains saw thee, and they trembled:\nthe overflowing of the water passed by:\nthe deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.",
      "11": "The sun and moon stood still in their habitation:\nat the light of thine arrows they went,\nand at the shining of thy glittering spear.",
      "12": "Thou didst march through the land in indignation,\nthou didst thresh the heathen in anger.",
      "13": "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,\neven for salvation with thine anointed;\nthou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,\nby discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.",
      "14": "Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:\nthey came out as a whirlwind to scatter me:\ntheir rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.",
      "15": "Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,\nthrough the heap of great waters.",
      "16": "When I heard, my belly trembled;\nmy lips quivered at the voice:\nrottenness entered into my bones,\nand I trembled in myself,\nthat I might rest in the day of trouble:\nwhen he cometh up unto the people,\nhe will invade them with his troops.",
      "17": "Although the fig tree shall not blossom,\nneither shall fruit be in the vines;\nthe labour of the olive shall fail,\nand the fields shall yield no meat;\nthe flock shall be cut off from the fold,\nand there shall be no herd in the stalls:",
      "18": "yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.",
