      "6": "The wind blows toward the south and shifts toward the north.\n    Round and round it blows. It blows in a full circle.",
      "7": "All streams flow into the sea, but the sea is never full.\n    The water goes back to the place where the streams began\n        in order to start flowing again.",
      "8": "All of these sayings are worn-out phrases. They are more than anyone can express, comprehend, or understand.",
      "9": "Whatever has happened before will happen again. Whatever has been done before will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Can you say that anything is new? It has already been here long before us.",
      "11": "Nothing from the past is remembered. Even in the future, nothing will be remembered by those who come after us.",
      "12": "I, the spokesman, have been king of Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "With all my heart I used wisdom to study and explore everything done under heaven.\nMortals are weighed down with a terrible burden that Elohim has placed on them.",
      "14": "I have seen everything that is done under the sun. Look at it! It’s all pointless. It’s like trying to catch the wind.",
      "15": "No one can straighten what is bent.\n    No one can count what is not there.",
      "16": "I thought to myself, “I have grown wiser than anyone who has ruled Jerusalem before me. I’ve had a lot of experience with wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "I’ve used my mind to understand wisdom and knowledge as well as madness and stupidity. Now I know that this is like trying to catch the wind.",

      "1": "I thought to myself, “Now I want to experiment with pleasure and enjoy myself.” But even this was pointless.",
      "2": "I thought, “Laughter doesn’t make any sense. What does pleasure accomplish?”",
      "3": "I explored ways to make myself feel better by drinking wine. I also explored ways to do some foolish things. During all that time, wisdom continued to control my mind. I was able to determine whether this was good for mortals to do during their brief lives under heaven.",
      "4": "I accomplished some great things:\nI built houses for myself.\n    I planted vineyards for myself.",
      "5": "I made gardens and parks for myself.\n    I planted every kind of fruit tree in them.",

      "9": "So I grew richer than anyone in Jerusalem before me. Yet, my wisdom remained with me.",
      "10": "If something appealed to me, I did it. I allowed myself to have any pleasure I wanted, since I found pleasure in my work. This was my reward for all my hard work.",
      "11": "But when I turned to look at all that I had accomplished and all the hard work I had put into it, I saw that it was all pointless. It was like trying to catch the wind. I gained nothing from any of my accomplishments under the sun.",
      "12": "Then I turned my attention to experience wisdom, madness, and foolishness. For instance, what can the man who replaces the king do? Only what has already been done.",
      "13": "But I saw that wisdom has an advantage over foolishness as light has an advantage over darkness.",
      "14": "A wise person uses the eyes in his head, but a fool walks in the dark. But I have also come to realize that the same destiny waits for both of them.",
      "15": "I thought to myself, “If the destiny that waits for the fool waits for me as well, then what is the advantage in being wise?” So I thought that even this is pointless.",
      "16": "Neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered for long, since both will be forgotten in the days to come. Both the wise person and the fool will die.",
      "17": "So I came to hate life because everything done under the sun seemed wrong to me. Everything was pointless. It was like trying to catch the wind.",
      "18": "I came to hate everything for which I had worked so hard under the sun, because I will have to leave it to the person who replaces me.",
      "19": "Who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? He will still have control over everything under the sun for which I worked so hard and used my wisdom. Even this is pointless.",
      "20": "Then I fell into despair over everything for which I had worked so hard under the sun.",
      "21": "Here is someone who had worked hard with wisdom, knowledge, and skill. Yet, he must turn over his estate to someone else, who didn’t work for it. Even this is pointless and a terrible tragedy.",
      "22": "What do people get from all of their hard work and struggles under the sun?",
      "23": "Their entire life is filled with pain, and their work is unbearable. Even at night their minds don’t rest. Even this is pointless.",
      "24": "There is nothing better for people to do than to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their work. I saw that even this comes from the hand of Elohim.",
      "25": "Who can eat or enjoy themselves without Elohim?",
      "26": "Elohim gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to anyone who pleases him. But to the person who continues to sin, he gives the job of gathering and collecting wealth. The sinner must turn his wealth over to the person who pleases Elohim. Even this is pointless. It’s like trying to catch the wind."

      "18": "I thought to myself, “Elohim is going to test humans in order to show them that they are like animals.”",
      "19": "Humans and animals have the same destiny. One dies just like the other. All of them have the same breath of life. Humans have no advantage over animals. All of life is pointless.",
      "20": "All life goes to the same place. All life comes from the ground, and all of it goes back to the ground.",
      "21": "Who knows whether a human spirit goes upward or whether an animal spirit goes downward to the earth?",

      "3": "But the person who hasn’t been born yet is better off than both of them. He hasn’t seen the evil that is done under the sun.",
      "4": "Then I saw that all hard work and skillful effort come from rivalry. Even this is pointless. It’s like trying to catch the wind.",
      "5": "A fool folds his hands and wastes away.",
      "6": "One handful of peace and quiet is better than two handfuls of hard work and of trying to catch the wind.",
      "7": "Next, I turned to look at something pointless under the sun:",
      "8": "There are people who are all alone. They have no children or other family members. So there is no end to all the hard work they have to do. Their eyes are never satisfied with riches. But they never ask themselves why they are working so hard and depriving themselves of good things. Even this is pointless and a terrible tragedy.",
      "9": "Two people are better than one because together they have a good reward for their hard work.",
      "10": "If one falls, the other can help his friend get up. But how tragic it is for the one who is all alone when he falls. There is no one to help him get up.",
      "11": "Again, if two people lie down together, they can keep warm, but how can one person keep warm?",
      "12": "Though one person may be overpowered by another, two people can resist one opponent. A triple-braided rope is not easily broken.",

      "4": "When you make a promise to Elohim, don’t be slow to keep it because Elohim doesn’t like fools. Keep your promise.",
      "5": "It is better not to make a promise than to make one and not keep it.",
      "6": "Don’t let your mouth talk you into committing a sin. Don’t say in the presence of a temple messenger, “My promise was a mistake!” Why should Elohim become angry at your excuse and destroy what you’ve accomplished?",
      "7": "In spite of many daydreams, pointless actions, and empty words, you should still fear Elohim.",
      "8": "Don’t be surprised if you see poor people being oppressed, denied justice, or denied their rights in any district. One authority is watching over another, and they both have authorities watching over them.",
      "9": "Yet, a king is an advantage for a country with cultivated fields.",
      "10": "Whoever loves money will never be satisfied with money. Whoever loves wealth will never be satisfied with more income. Even this is pointless.",
      "11": "As the number of goods increase, so do the number of people who consume them. What do owners gain from all their goods except the opportunity to look at them?",
      "12": "The sleep of working people is sweet, whether they eat a little or a lot. But the full stomachs that rich people have will not allow them to sleep.",
      "13": "There is a painful tragedy that I have seen under the sun: Riches lead to the downfall of those who hoard them.",
      "14": "These hoarded riches were then lost in bad business deals. The owners had children, but now they have nothing to give them.",
      "15": "They came from their mother’s womb naked. They will leave as naked as they came. They won’t even be able to take a handful of their earnings with them from all their hard work.",
      "16": "This also is a painful tragedy: They leave exactly as they came. What advantage do they gain from working so hard for the wind?",
      "17": "They spend their entire lives in darkness, in constant frustration, sickness, and resentment.",
      "18": "At last I have seen what is good and beautiful: It is to eat and drink and to enjoy the good in all our hard work under the sun during the brief lives Elohim gives us. That is our lot in life.",
      "19": "It is a gift from Elohim when Elohim gives some people wealth and possessions, the power to enjoy them, the ability to accept their lot in life, and the ability to rejoice in their own hard work.",

      "3": "Suppose a rich person wasn’t satisfied with good things while he was alive and didn’t even get an honorable burial after he died. Suppose he had a hundred children and lived for many years. No matter how long he would have lived, it still would have been better for him to have been born dead.",

      "9": "Don’t be quick to get angry, because anger is typical of fools.",
      "10": "Don’t ask, “Why were things better in the old days than they are now?” It isn’t wisdom that leads you to ask this!",
      "11": "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. It is an advantage to everyone who sees the sun.",
      "12": "Wisdom protects us just as money protects us, but the advantage of wisdom is that it gives life to those who have it.",
      "13": "Consider what Elohim has done! Who can straighten what Elohim has bent?",
      "14": "When times are good, be happy. But when times are bad, consider this: Elohim has made the one time as well as the other so that mortals cannot predict their future.",
      "15": "I have seen it all in my pointless life:\nRighteous people die in spite of being righteous.\n    Wicked people go on living in spite of being wicked.",
      "16": "Don’t be too virtuous, and don’t be too wise. Why make yourself miserable?",
      "17": "Don’t be too wicked, and don’t be a fool. Why should you die before your time is up?",
      "18": "It’s good to hold on to the one and not let go of the other, because the one who fears Elohim will be able to avoid both extremes.",

      "20": "Certainly, there is no one so righteous on earth that he always does what is good and never sins.",

      "22": "Your conscience knows that you have cursed others many times.",
      "23": "I used wisdom to test all of this. I said, “I want to be wise, but it is out of my reach.”",
      "24": "Whatever wisdom may be, it is out of reach. It is deep, very deep. Who can find out what it is?",
      "25": "I turned my attention to study, to explore, and to seek out wisdom and the reason for things. I learned that wickedness is stupid and foolishness is madness.",

      "16": "When I carefully considered how to study wisdom and how to look at the work that is done on earth (even going without sleep day and night),",
      "17": "then I saw everything that Elohim has done. No one is able to grasp the work that is done under the sun. However hard a person may search for it, he will not find its meaning. Even though a wise person claims to know, he is not able to grasp it."

      "2": "Everything turns out the same way for everyone. All people will share the same destiny, whether they are righteous, wicked, or good, clean or unclean, whether they offer sacrifices or don’t offer sacrifices. Good people are treated like sinners. People who take oaths are treated like those who are afraid to take oaths.",
      "3": "This is the tragedy of everything that happens under the sun: Everyone shares the same destiny. Moreover, the hearts of mortals are full of evil. Madness is in their hearts while they are still alive. After that, they join the dead.",

      "10": "Whatever presents itself for you to do, do it with all your might, because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or skill in the grave where you’re going.",
      "11": "I saw something else under the sun. The race isn’t won by fast runners, or the battle by heroes. Wise people don’t necessarily have food. Intelligent people don’t necessarily have riches, and skilled people don’t necessarily receive special treatment. But time and unpredictable events overtake all of them.",
