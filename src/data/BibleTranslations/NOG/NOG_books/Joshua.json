      "1": "After the death of Yahweh’s servant Moses, Yahweh said to Moses’ assistant Joshua, son of Nun,",
      "2": "“My servant Moses is dead. Now you and all these people must cross the Jordan River into the land that I am going to give the people of Israel.",
      "3": "I will give you every place on which you set foot, as I promised Moses.",
      "4": "Your borders will be the desert on the south, nearby Lebanon to the Euphrates River (the country of the Hittites) on the north, and the Mediterranean Sea on the west.",
      "5": "No one will be able to oppose you successfully as long as you live. I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will never neglect you or abandon you.",
      "6": "Be strong and courageous, because you will help these people take possession of the land I swore to give their ancestors.",
      "7": "“Only be strong and very courageous, faithfully doing everything in the teachings that my servant Moses commanded you. Don’t turn away from them. Then you will succeed wherever you go.",
      "8": "Never stop reciting these teachings. You must think about them night and day so that you will faithfully do everything written in them. Only then will you prosper and succeed.",
      "9": "“I have commanded you, ‘Be strong and courageous! Don’t tremble or be terrified, because Yahweh your Elohim is with you wherever you go.’”",
      "10": "Then Joshua ordered the officers of the people,",
      "11": "“Go through the camp. Tell the people, ‘Get your supplies ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River to take possession of the land Yahweh your Elohim is going to give you.’”",
      "12": "Next, Joshua said to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh,",
      "13": "“Remember what Yahweh’s servant Moses commanded you. Moses said, ‘Yahweh your Elohim will give you this land—a place to rest.’",
      "14": "Your wives, children, and livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan River. However, all your best soldiers must march in battle formation ahead of your relatives. You must help your relatives",
      "15": "take possession of the land Yahweh your Elohim is going to give them. Then they will have a place to rest like you do. After that, you may go back and take possession of the land east of the Jordan River which Yahweh’s servant Moses gave you.”",
      "16": "The people responded to Joshua, “We’ll do everything you tell us and go wherever you send us.",
      "17": "We will obey you as we obeyed Moses. May Yahweh your Elohim be with you as he was with Moses.",
      "18": "Whoever rebels against your authority or does not obey your orders will be put to death. Just be strong and courageous!”"

      "1": "From Shittim Joshua, son of Nun, secretly sent out two men as spies. He told them, “Go, look at that country, especially the city of Jericho.” So they went to Jericho and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab to spend the night there.",
      "2": "The king of Jericho was told, “Some Israelites have entered the city tonight. They came to gather information about our land.”",
      "3": "So the king of Jericho sent messengers to Rahab, who told her, “Bring out the men who came to your house. They came here to gather information about the entire land.”",
      "4": "But the woman had already taken the two men inside and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come here. But I didn’t know where they had come from.",
      "5": "When it was dark and the gate was just about to close, they left. I don’t know where they went. If you hurry, you’ll catch up with them.”",
      "6": "(She had taken them up to the roof and covered them with the flax which she had laid up there.)",
      "7": "The king’s men pursued them on the road leading to a shallow place to cross the Jordan River. As soon as the king’s men had left, the gate was closed.",
      "8": "Before the spies fell asleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof.",
      "9": "She said to them, “I know Yahweh will give you this land. Your presence terrifies us. All the people in this country are deathly afraid of you.",
      "10": "We’ve heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea in front of you when you left Egypt. We’ve also heard what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites, who ruled east of the Jordan River. We’ve heard how you destroyed them for the Lord.",
      "11": "When we heard about it, we lost heart. There was no courage left in any of us because of you. Yahweh your Elohim is the Elohim of heaven and earth.",
      "12": "Please swear by Yahweh that you’ll be as kind to my father’s family as I’ve been to you. Also give me some proof",
      "13": "that you’ll protect my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and their households, and that you’ll save us from death.”",
      "14": "The men promised her, “We pledge our lives for your lives. If you don’t tell anyone what we’re doing here, we’ll treat you kindly and honestly when Yahweh gives us this land.”",
      "15": "So she let them down by a rope from her window since her house was built into the city wall. (She lived in the city wall.)",
      "16": "She told them, “Go to the mountains so that the men who are pursuing you will not find you. Hide there for three days until they return to Jericho. Then you can go on your way.”",
      "17": "The men told her, “We will be free from the oath which you made us swear, if you tell anyone what we’re doing here.",
      "18": "When we invade your land, tie this red cord in the window through which you let us down. Also, gather your father, mother, brothers, and all your father’s family into your house.",
      "19": "Whoever leaves your house will be responsible for his own life. We will be free from that responsibility. But we will take responsibility if anyone inside your house is harmed.",
      "20": "If you tell anyone what we’re doing here, we will be free from the oath which you made us swear.”",
      "21": "“I agree,” she said. So she let them go and tied the red cord in the window.",
      "22": "The men went to the mountains and stayed there for three days until the king’s men returned to Jericho. The king’s men had searched for them all along the road but had not found them.",
      "23": "Then the two spies came down out of the mountains, crossed the Jordan River, and returned to Joshua, son of Nun. They told him everything that had happened to them.",
      "24": "They told Joshua, “Yahweh has given us the whole country. The people who live there are deathly afraid of us.”"

    "3": {
      "1": "Joshua got up early the next morning. He and all the Israelites left Shittim. They came to the Jordan River, where they camped before crossing.",
      "2": "Three days later the officers went through the camp.",
      "3": "They told the people, “As soon as you see the ark of the promise of Yahweh your Elohim and the Levitical priests who carry it, break camp and follow them.",
      "4": "However, stay about half a mile behind them. Don’t come any closer to them so that you will know which way to go because you have not gone this way before.”",
      "5": "Joshua told the people, “Perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy because tomorrow Yahweh will do miracles among you.”",
      "6": "Joshua also told the priests, “Take the ark of the promise, and go ahead of the people.” They did as they were told.",
      "7": "Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to honor you in front of all the people of Israel. I will do this to let them know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.",
      "8": "Order the priests who carry the ark of the promise, ‘When you step into the water of the Jordan River, stand there.’”",
      "9": "So Joshua said to the people of Israel, “Come here, and listen to the words of Yahweh your Elohim.”",
      "10": "Joshua continued, “This is how you will know that El Chay is among you and that he will certainly force the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites out of your way.",
      "11": "Watch the ark of the promise of the Adonay of the whole earth as it goes ahead of you into the Jordan River.",
      "12": "Choose one man from each of the 12 tribes of Israel.",
      "13": "The priests who carry the ark of Yahweh, the Adonay of the whole earth, will stand in the water of the Jordan. Then the water flowing from upstream will stop and stand up like a dam.”",
      "14": "So they broke camp to cross the Jordan River. The priests who carried the ark of the promise went ahead of the people.",
      "15": "(The Jordan overflows all its banks during the harvest season.) When the priests who were carrying the ark came to the edge of the Jordan River and set foot in",
      "16": "the water, the water stopped flowing from upstream. The water rose up like a dam as far away as the city of Adam near Zarethan. The water flowing down toward the Sea of the Plains (the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. Then the people crossed from the east side of the Jordan River directly opposite Jericho.",
      "17": "The priests who carried the ark of Yahweh’s promise stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan until the whole nation of Israel had crossed the Jordan River on dry ground."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "The whole nation finished crossing the Jordan River. Yahweh had told Joshua,",
      "2": "“Choose one man from each of the 12 tribes.",
      "3": "Order them to pick up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, where the priests’ feet stood firmly. Take the stones along with you, and set them down where you will camp tonight.”",
      "4": "Joshua called the 12 men whom he had selected (one from each tribe).",
      "5": "He said to them, “Go to the middle of the Jordan River in front of the ark of Yahweh your Elohim. Each man must take a stone on his shoulder, one for each tribe of Israel.",
      "6": "This will be a sign for you. In the future your children will ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’",
      "7": "You should answer, ‘The water of the Jordan River was cut off in front of the ark of Yahweh’s promise. When the ark crossed the Jordan, the river stopped flowing. These stones are a permanent reminder for the people of Israel.’”",
      "8": "The people of Israel did as Joshua had ordered. They took 12 stones, one for each of the tribes of Israel. They took them from the middle of the Jordan as Yahweh had told Joshua. They carried them to the camp and set them down there.",
      "9": "Joshua also set 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan River, where the priests who carried the ark of the promise had stood. The stones are still there today.",
      "10": "The priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan. They stood there until everything Yahweh had ordered Joshua to tell the people had been carried out. This was as Moses had told Joshua. The people hurried to the other side.",
      "11": "As soon as everyone had crossed, the priests with Yahweh’s ark crossed and went ahead of them.",
      "12": "The men of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh did as Moses had told them. They marched across in battle formation ahead of the people of Israel.",
      "13": "About 40,000 armed men crossed the river in front of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.",
      "14": "On that day Yahweh honored Joshua in the presence of all the Israelites. As long as Joshua lived, the Israelites respected him in the same way they had respected Moses.",
      "15": "Yahweh said to Joshua,",
      "16": "“Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to come out of the Jordan River.”",
      "17": "So Joshua ordered the priests, “Come out of the Jordan.”",
      "18": "The priests who carried the ark of Yahweh’s promise came out of the middle of the Jordan. When their feet stepped onto dry land, the water of the Jordan returned to its seasonal flood level.",
      "19": "On the tenth day of the first month, the people came out of the Jordan River. They made their camp at Gilgal, just east of Jericho.",
      "20": "At Gilgal Joshua set up the 12 stones they had taken from the Jordan.",
      "21": "He said to the people of Israel, “In the future when children ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’",
      "22": "the children should be told that Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground.",
      "23": "Yahweh your Elohim dried up the Jordan ahead of you until you had crossed, as he did to the Red Sea until we had crossed.",
      "24": "Yahweh did this so that everyone in the world would know his mighty power and that you would fear Yahweh your Elohim every day of your life.”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan River and all the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea heard that Yahweh had dried up the Jordan River so that the Israelites could cross. So they lost heart and had no courage left to face the people of Israel.",
      "2": "At that time Yahweh spoke to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise the men of Israel.”",
      "3": "So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision.",
      "4": "This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: All the soldiers had died on the way through the desert after they left Egypt.",
      "5": "The men who left Egypt had been circumcised. However, the men born later, on the way through the desert, were not circumcised.",
      "6": "For 40 years the Israelites wandered through the desert until all their soldiers who left Egypt died. They died because they disobeyed Yahweh. Yahweh swore that he would not let them see this land flowing with milk and honey which Yahweh had sworn to give our ancestors.",
      "7": "The sons who took their place had not been circumcised on the way. So Joshua circumcised them.",
      "8": "When all the men had been circumcised, they remained in the camp until they recovered.",
      "9": "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you.” So Joshua named the place Gilgal, the name it still has today.",
      "10": "The people of Israel camped at Gilgal in the Jericho plain. There they celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month.",
      "11": "On the day after the Passover, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened bread and roasted grain.",
      "12": "The day after that, the manna stopped. The people of Israel never had manna again. That year they began to eat the crops that grew in Canaan.",
      "13": "When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you one of us or one of our enemies?”",
      "14": "He answered, “Neither one! I am here as the commander of Yahweh’s army.” Immediately, Joshua bowed with his face touching the ground and worshiped. He asked, “Sir, what do you want to tell me?”",
      "15": "The commander of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals because this place where you are standing is holy.” So Joshua did as he was told."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Jericho was bolted and barred shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one could enter or leave.",
      "2": "Yahweh said to Joshua, “I am about to hand Jericho, its king, and its warriors over to you.",
      "3": "All the soldiers will march around the city once a day for six days.",
      "4": "Seven priests will carry rams’ horns ahead of the ark. But on the seventh day you must march around the city seven times while the priests blow their horns.",
      "5": "When you hear a long blast on the horn, all the troops must shout very loudly. The wall around the city will collapse. Then the troops must charge straight ahead into the city.”",
      "6": "Joshua, son of Nun, summoned the priests. He said to them, “Pick up the ark of the promise, and have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns ahead of Yahweh’s ark.”",
      "7": "He told the troops, “March around the city. Let the armed men march ahead of Yahweh’s ark.”",
      "8": "After Joshua had given orders to the troops, the seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns ahead of Yahweh marched off as they blew their horns. The ark of Yahweh’s promise followed them.",
      "9": "The armed men went ahead of the priests, who blew their horns. The rear guard followed the ark while the priests continued to blow their horns.",
      "10": "Joshua ordered the troops, “Don’t shout, make any noise, or let one word come out of your mouth until I tell you to shout. Then shout!”",
      "11": "So Yahweh’s ark went around the city once. Then they went back to the camp and stayed there for the night.",
      "12": "Joshua got up early in the morning. The priests carried Yahweh’s ark.",
      "13": "The seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns were ahead of it. The priests blew their horns as they went. The armed men were ahead of them, and the rear guard followed Yahweh’s ark while the horns blew continually.",
      "14": "They went around the city once on the second day and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.",
      "15": "On the seventh day they got up at dawn. They marched around the city seven times the same way they had done it before. That was the only day they marched around it seven times.",
      "16": "When they went around the seventh time, the priests blew their rams’ horns.\nJoshua said to the troops, “Shout, because Yahweh has given you the city!",
      "17": "The city has been claimed by the Lord. Everything in it belongs to Yahweh. Only the prostitute Rahab and all who are in the house with her will live because she hid the messengers we sent.",
      "18": "But stay away from what has been claimed by the Lord for destruction, or you, too, will be destroyed by the Lord. If you take anything that is claimed by the Lord, you will bring destruction and disaster on the camp of Israel.",
      "19": "All the silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron are holy and belong to Yahweh. They must go into Yahweh’s treasury.”",
      "20": "So the troops shouted very loudly when they heard the blast of the rams’ horns, and the wall collapsed. The troops charged straight ahead and captured the city.",
      "21": "They claimed everything in it for the Lord. With their swords they killed men and women, young and old, as well as cattle, sheep, and donkeys.",
      "22": "But Joshua said to the two spies, “Go to the prostitute’s house. Bring the woman out, along with everything she has, as you swore you would do for her.”",
      "23": "The spies went and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, everything she had, and even all of her relatives. They gave them a place outside the camp of Israel.",
      "24": "Then Israel burned the city and everything in it. But they put the silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron into Yahweh’s treasury.",
      "25": "Joshua spared the prostitute Rahab, her father’s family, and everything she had. She still lives in Israel today because she hid the messengers Joshua had sent to look at Jericho.",
      "26": "At that time Joshua pronounced this curse:\n“Yahweh will curse\n    whoever comes to rebuild the city of Jericho.\n        It will cost him his firstborn son\n            to lay the foundation.\n        It will cost him his youngest son\n            to set up the city doors.”",
      "27": "So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "The people of Israel proved to be disloyal about the things claimed by the Lord. Achan, son of Carmi, grandson of Zabdi, great-grandson of Zerah, and a member of the tribe of Judah, took something that had been claimed by the Lord. So Yahweh became angry with the people of Israel.",
      "2": "Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai. Ai is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He said to them, “Go, look at that country.” So the men went and looked at Ai.",
      "3": "They came back to Joshua and told him, “You don’t need to send all the troops. Only about two or three thousand men are needed to destroy Ai. Don’t tire the troops out by sending all of them. There are only a few troops in Ai.”",
      "4": "So about three thousand men were sent. However, they fled from the men of Ai.",
      "5": "The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the city gate to the slope of the stone quarries. Israel’s troops lost heart and were scared stiff.",
      "6": "Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief. They put dust on their heads and bowed down to the ground in front of Yahweh’s ark. They stayed there until evening.",
      "7": "Joshua said, “Adonay Yahweh, why did you bring these people across the Jordan River? Was it to hand us over to the Amorites so that they could destroy us? I wish we had been content to live on the other side of the Jordan!",
      "8": "Adonay, what else can I say after Israel ran away from its enemy?",
      "9": "When the Canaanites and everyone who lives in the land hears about it, they will surround us and remove every memory of us from the earth. What will you do then so that your great name will be remembered?”",
      "10": "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! What are you doing bowing on the ground?",
      "11": "Israel has sinned. They have ignored the requirements that I have placed on them. They have taken what I claimed for myself and put it among their own goods. They have not only stolen, but they have also lied.",
      "12": "“The people of Israel will not be able to defend themselves against their enemies. They will run away from their enemies because the people of Israel are now claimed for destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy what I have claimed for myself.",
      "13": "“Get up! Tell the people, ‘Get ready for tomorrow by performing the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. This is what Yahweh Elohim of Israel says: You have what I claimed for myself, Israel. You will not be able to defend yourselves against your enemies until you get rid of what I have claimed.",
      "14": "In the morning come forward by tribes to the tent of meeting. The tribe Yahweh selects will come forward by families. Then the family Yahweh selects will come forward by households, and the household Yahweh selects will come forward man by man.",
      "15": "The man who is selected, along with everything he has, must be burned because he has stolen what the Lord has claimed. He has ignored Yahweh’s requirements and done a godless thing in Israel.’”",
      "16": "Joshua got up early in the morning. He had Israel come forward by tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.",
      "17": "Then he had the families of Judah come forward, and the family of Zerah was selected. Then he had the family of Zerah come forward man by man, and Zabdi was selected.",
      "18": "Then he had Zabdi’s household come forward man by man, and Achan was selected. Achan from the tribe of Judah was the son of Carmi, grandson of Zabdi, and great-grandson of Zerah.",
      "19": "Joshua said to Achan, “Son, give honor and praise to Yahweh Elohim of Israel! Tell me what you have done. Don’t hide anything from me.”",
      "20": "Then Achan answered Joshua, “It’s true. I have sinned against Yahweh Elohim of Israel. This is what I did:",
      "21": "I saw a fine robe from Babylonia, five pounds of silver, and a bar of gold weighing about one pound among the loot. I wanted them, so I took them. You will find them buried inside my tent with the silver beneath them.”",
      "22": "Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. The loot was buried inside with the silver beneath it.",
      "23": "They took the loot from the tent and brought it to Joshua and all the people of Israel. Then they laid it out in the presence of Yahweh.",
      "24": "Joshua and all Israel took Achan (son of Zerah), the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, and his tent—everything he had—and brought them to the valley of Achor [Disaster].",
      "25": "Then Joshua said, “Why did you bring this disaster on us? Yahweh will bring disaster on you today!” And all Israel stoned Achan and his family to death. Then they burned the bodies and piled stones over them.",
      "26": "They made such a large pile of stones over Achan that it is still there today. Then Yahweh withdrew his burning anger. For this reason that place is still called the valley of Achor today."

      "3": "So Joshua and all the soldiers started to march against Ai. Joshua picked 30,000 of his best soldiers and sent them out at night",

      "19": "The men who were hiding got up as soon as he stretched out his hand. They entered the city, captured it, and quickly set it on fire.",
      "20": "When the men of Ai looked back, they could see the city going up in smoke. They had no place to go, since the Israelites, who had been running toward the desert, had now turned back on them.",

      "22": "The men who had captured the city also came out and attacked them. The men of Ai were caught between the battle lines of Israel. So Israel attacked them on both sides. None of them survived or escaped.",
      "23": "But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.",
      "24": "Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had been pursued. They put them all to death; not one person survived. Then the Israelites went back to Ai and killed everyone left there.",

      "26": "Then we said, ‘Let’s build an altar for ourselves. It will not be for burnt offerings or sacrifices,",
      "27": "but it will stand as a witness between us for generations to come. It will stand as a witness that we may worship in the presence of Yahweh with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings.’ Then your descendants cannot say to our descendants, ‘You have no connection with Yahweh!’",
      "28": "So we thought, if this statement is made to us or to our descendants in the future, we will answer, ‘Look at the model of Yahweh’s altar our ancestors made. They didn’t make it for burnt offerings or sacrifices but to stand as a witness between us.’",
      "29": "It would be unthinkable for us to rebel against Yahweh or to turn back today from following Yahweh by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices in addition to the altar of Yahweh our Elohim that is in front of his tent.”",
      "30": "When the priest Phinehas, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the divisions of Israel heard what the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh said, they were satisfied.",

      "32": "Then Phinehas (son of the priest Eleazar) and the leaders returned from Reuben and Gad in Gilead to Israel in Canaan and gave them the report.",
      "33": "The people of Israel were satisfied with the report. So they praised Elohim and didn’t talk anymore about going to war against Reuben and Gad and destroying the land where they were living.",
