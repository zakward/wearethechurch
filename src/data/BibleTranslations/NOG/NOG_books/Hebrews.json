      "3": "His Son is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact likeness of God’s being. He holds everything together through his powerful words. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he received the highest position, the one next to the Father in heaven.",
      "4": "The Son has become greater than the angels since he has been given a name that is superior to theirs.",
      "5": "God never said to any of his angels,\n    “You are my Son.\n        Today I have become your Father.”\nAnd God never said to any of his angels,\n    “I will be his Father,\n        and he will be my Son.”",
      "6": "When God was about to send his firstborn Son into the world, he said,\n    “All of God’s angels must worship him.”",
      "7": "God said about the angels,\n    “He makes his messengers winds.\n    He makes his servants flames of fire.”",
      "8": "But God said about his Son,\n    “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.\n        The scepter in your kingdom is a scepter for justice.",
      "9": "You have loved what is right and hated what is wrong.\n        That is why God, your God,\n            anointed you, rather than your companions, with the oil of joy.”",
      "10": "God also said,\n“Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth.\n    With your own hands you made the heavens.",

      "3": "So how will we escape punishment if we reject the important message, the message that God saved us? First, the Lord told this saving message. Then those who heard him confirmed that message.",
      "4": "God verified what they said through miraculous signs, amazing things, other powerful acts, and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit as he wanted.",
      "5": "He didn’t put the world that will come (about which we are talking) under the angels’ control.",

      "7": "You made him a little lower than the angels.\n    You crowned him with glory and honor.",
      "8": "You put everything under his control.”\nWhen God put everything under his Son’s control, nothing was left out.\nHowever, at the present time we still don’t see everything under his Son’s control.",
      "9": "Yeshua was made a little lower than the angels, but we see him crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death. Through God’s kindness he died on behalf of everyone.",
      "10": "God is the one for whom and through whom everything exists. Therefore, while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was the right time to bring Yeshua, the source of their salvation, to the end of his work through suffering.",
      "11": "Yeshua, who makes people holy, and all those who are made holy have the same Father. That is why Yeshua isn’t ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.",
      "12": "He says,\n“I will tell my people about your name.\n    I will praise you within the congregation.”",
      "13": "In addition, Yeshua says,\n“I will trust him.”\nAnd Yeshua says,\n“I am here with the sons and daughters God has given me.”",
      "14": "Since all of these sons and daughters have flesh and blood, Yeshua took on flesh and blood to be like them. He did this so that by dying he would destroy the one who had power over death (that is, the devil).",
      "15": "In this way he would free those who were slaves all their lives because they were afraid of dying.",
      "16": "So Yeshua helps Abraham’s descendants rather than helping angels.",
      "17": "Therefore, he had to become like his brothers and sisters so that he could be merciful. He became like them so that he could serve as a faithful chief priest in God’s presence and make peace with God for their sins.",

      "3": "Yeshua deserves more praise than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house is praised more than the house.",
      "4": "After all, every house has a builder, but the builder of everything is God.",

      "13": "Encourage each other every day while you have the opportunity. If you do this, none of you will be deceived by sin and become stubborn.",

      "18": "Who did God swear would never enter his place of rest? He was talking about those who didn’t obey him.",

      "3": "We who believe are entering that place of rest. As God said, “So I angrily took a solemn oath that they would never enter my place of rest.” God said this even though he had finished his work when he created the world.",
      "4": "Somewhere in Scripture God has said this about the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.”",
      "5": "God also said in the same passage, “They will never enter my place of rest.”",
      "6": "However, some people enter that place of rest. Those who heard the Good News in the past did not enter God’s place of rest because they did not obey God.",
      "7": "So God set another day. That day is today. Many years after your ancestors failed to enter that place of rest God spoke about it through David in the passage already quoted: “If you hear God speak today, don’t be stubborn.”",
      "8": "If Joshua had given the people rest, God would not have spoken about another day.",
      "9": "Therefore, a time of rest and worship exists for God’s people.",
      "10": "Those who entered his place of rest also rested from their work as God did from his.",
      "11": "So we must make every effort to enter that place of rest. Then no one will be lost by following the example of those who refused to obey.",
      "12": "God’s word is living and active. It is sharper than any two-edged sword and cuts as deep as the place where soul and spirit meet, the place where joints and marrow meet. God’s word judges a person’s thoughts and intentions.",
      "13": "No creature can hide from God. Everything is uncovered and exposed for him to see. We must answer to him.",
      "14": "We need to hold on to our declaration of faith: We have a superior chief priest who has gone through the heavens. That person is Yeshua, the Son of God.",
      "15": "We have a chief priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. He was tempted in every way that we are, but he didn’t sin.",

      "4": "No one takes this honor for himself. Instead, God calls him as he called Aaron.",
      "5": "So Christ did not take the glory of being a chief priest for himself. Instead, the glory was given to him by God, who said,\n“You are my Son.\n    Today I have become your Father.”",
      "6": "In another place in Scripture, God said,\n“You are a priest forever,\n    in the way Melchizedek was a priest.”",

      "12": "By now you should be teachers. Instead, you still need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food.",
      "13": "All those who live on milk lack the experience to talk about what is right. They are still babies.",

      "14": "He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.”",
      "15": "So Abraham received what God promised because he waited patiently for it.",
      "16": "When people take oaths, they base their oaths on someone greater than themselves. Their oaths guarantee what they say and end all arguments.",
      "17": "God wouldn’t change his plan. He wanted to make this perfectly clear to those who would receive his promise, so he took an oath.",

If the work of the Levitical priests had been perfect, we wouldn’t need to speak about another kind of priest. However, we speak about another kind of priest, a priest like Melchizedek, not a Levitical priest like Aaron.",

      "18": "The former requirements are rejected because they are weak and useless.",

      "27": "We need a priest who doesn’t have to bring daily sacrifices as those chief priests did. First they brought sacrifices for their own sins, and then they brought sacrifices for the sins of the people. Yeshua brought the sacrifice for the sins of the people once and for all when he sacrificed himself.",
      "28": "Moses’ Teachings designated mortals as chief priests even though they had weaknesses. But God’s promise, which came after Moses’ Teachings, designated the Son who forever accomplished everything that God required."

      "3": "Every chief priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this chief priest had to offer something.",

      "9": "The first part of the tent is an example for the present time. The gifts and sacrifices that were brought there could not give the worshiper a clear conscience.",

      "14": "The blood of Christ, who had no defect, does even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself to God and cleansed our consciences from the useless things we had done. Now we can serve the living God.",
      "15": "Because Christ offered himself to God, he is able to bring a new promise from God. Through his death he paid the price to set people free from the sins they committed under the first promise. He did this so that those who are called can be guaranteed an inheritance that will last forever.",
