      "3": "Oxen know their owners,\n    and donkeys know where their masters feed them.\n    But Israel doesn’t know its owner.\n    My people don’t understand who feeds them.",
      "4": "“How horrible it will be for a nation that sins.\n    Its people are loaded down with guilt.\n        They are descendants of evildoers\n            and destructive children.\n    They have abandoned Yahweh.\n    They have despised Qedosh Yisrael.\n    They have turned their backs on him.",
      "5": "“Why do you still want to be beaten?\n    Why do you continue to rebel?\n    Your whole head is infected.\n    Your whole heart is failing.",

      "21": "How the faithful town has become a prostitute!\n    She was full of justice,\n        and righteousness lived in her.\n            But now murderers live there!",
      "22": "Your silver is not pure.\n    Your wine is watered down.",
      "23": "Your rulers are rebels, friends with thieves.\n    They all love bribes and run after gifts.\n    They never defend orphans.\n    They don’t notice the widows’ pleas.",
      "24": "That’s why Adonay, Yahweh Tsebaoth, the Mighty One of Israel, says,\n“How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents!\n    I will avenge myself against my enemies.",

      "26": "I will give you judges like you had long ago,\n    advisers like you had in the beginning.\n    After that you will be called the Righteous City,\n    the Faithful Town.”",
      "27": "Zion will be pardoned by the Lord’s justice,\n    and those who return will be pardoned\n        by the Lord’s righteousness.",
      "28": "Rebels and sinners will be crushed at the same time,\n    and those who abandon Yahweh will come to an end.",
      "29": "You will be ashamed of the oaks that you wanted to worship\n    and embarrassed by the garden that you have chosen for your gods.",
      "30": "You will be like an oak whose leaves wither\n    and like a garden without water.",
      "31": "Strong people will become tinder for a fire,\n    and their work will be the spark.\n    Both of them will burn together,\n    and there will be no one to put out the fire."
