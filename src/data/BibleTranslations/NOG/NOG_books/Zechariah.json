      "5": "Your ancestors—where are they now? And the prophets—are they still alive?",
      "6": "Didn’t my warnings and my laws, which I’ve commanded my servants the prophets to preach, finally catch up with your ancestors? Then your ancestors turned away from their sins and said, ‘Yahweh Tsebaoth has done to us what he had planned to do. He has dealt with us as our ways and deeds deserve.’”",

      "20": "Then Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.",
      "21": "I asked, “What are they going to do?”\nHe answered, “Those horns scattered Judah so widely that no one could lift up his head. But the craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations. The nations raised their horns to scatter the land of Judah.”"

      "3": "Joshua was wearing filthy clothes and was standing in front of the Messenger.",
      "4": "The Messenger said to those who were standing in front of him, “Remove Joshua’s filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken your sin away from you, and I will dress you in fine clothing.”",
      "5": "So I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” They put a clean turban on his head and dressed him while the Messenger of Yahweh was standing there.",
      "6": "The Messenger of Yahweh advised Joshua,",
      "7": "“This is what Yahweh Tsebaoth says: If you live according to my ways and follow my requirements, you will govern my temple and watch over my courtyards. Then I will give you free access to walk among those standing here.",
      "8": "“Listen, Chief Priest Joshua and your friends sitting with you. These men are a sign of things to come: I’m going to bring my servant, the Branch.",
      "9": "“Look at the stone I have set in front of Joshua. That one stone has seven eyes. I am engraving an inscription on it,” declares Yahweh Tsebaoth. “I will remove this land’s sin in a single day.",
      "10": "On that day,” declares Yahweh Tsebaoth, “each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree.”"

      "5": "Then the angel asked me, “Don’t you know what they mean?”\n“No, sir,” I answered.",
      "6": "Then he replied, “This is the word Yahweh spoke to Zerubbabel: You won’t succeed by might or by power, but by my Ruach, says Yahweh Tsebaoth.",
      "7": "What a high mountain you are! In front of Zerubbabel you will become a plain. He will bring out the topmost stone with shouts of ‘Blessings, blessings on it!’”",
      "8": "Then Yahweh spoke his word to me. He said,",
      "9": "“Zerubbabel’s hands have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that Yahweh Tsebaoth has sent me to you.",
      "10": "Who despised the day when little things began to happen? They will be delighted when they see the plumb line in Zerubbabel’s hand. (These seven eyes of Yahweh roam over all the earth.)”",
      "11": "I asked the angel, “What do these two olive trees at the right and the left of the lamp stand mean?”",
      "12": "Again I asked him, “What is the meaning of the two branches from the olive trees next to the two golden pipes that are pouring out gold?”",
      "13": "He asked me, “Don’t you know what these things mean?”\n“No, sir,” I answered.",

      "3": "Then he said to me, “This is a curse that will go out all over the earth. The one side of the scroll says that every thief will be forced away. The other side of the scroll says that everyone who takes an oath will be forced away.",
      "4": "I will send out a curse, declares Yahweh Tsebaoth, and it will enter the houses of thieves and the houses of those who take oaths in my name. It will stay in their houses and destroy the timber and stone.”",
