      "20": "Reuel asked his daughters, “Where is he? Why did you leave the man there? Go, invite him to supper.”",
      "21": "Moses decided to stay with the man. So Reuel gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as his wife.",
      "22": "She gave birth to a son. Moses named him Gershom [Foreigner], because he said, “I was a foreigner living in another country.”",

      "3": "Yahweh said, “Throw it on the ground.”\nWhen Moses threw it on the ground, it became a snake, and he ran away from it.",
      "4": "Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out and grab the snake by its tail.” He reached out and grabbed it, and it turned back into a staff as he held it.",
      "5": "The Lord explained, “This is to convince the people that Yahweh Elohim of their ancestors, the Elohim of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appeared to you.”",
      "6": "Yahweh said to him, “Put your hand inside your shirt.” So Moses did this, and when he took his hand out, it had a skin disease. It looked as flaky as snow.",
      "7": "“Now put your hand back inside your shirt,” Yahweh said. Moses put it back, and when he took it out this time, it was healthy again like the rest of his body.",
      "8": "Then the Lord said, “If they won’t believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.",

      "10": "Moses said to Yahweh, “Please, Adonay, I’m not a good speaker. I’ve never been a good speaker, and I’m not now, even though you’ve spoken to me. I speak slowly, and I become tongue-tied easily.”",
      "11": "Yahweh asked him, “Who gave humans their mouths? Who makes humans unable to talk or hear? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? It is I, Yahweh!",
      "12": "Now go, and I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”",

      "19": "Now, Yahweh had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, because all the men who wanted to kill you are dead.”",
      "20": "So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and started out for Egypt. He also brought with him the staff Elohim had told him to take.",

      "23": "I told you to let my son go so that he may worship me. But you refused to let him go. So now I’m going to kill your firstborn son.’”",
      "24": "Along the way they stopped for the night. Yahweh met Moses and tried to kill him.",
      "25": "Then Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet with it. She said, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me!”",
      "26": "So Yahweh let him alone. It was because of the circumcision that she said at that time, “You are a bridegroom of blood!”",
      "27": "Meanwhile, Yahweh had told Aaron to meet Moses in the desert.\nWhen Aaron met Moses at the mountain of Elohim, he kissed him.",
      "28": "Moses told Aaron everything Yahweh had sent him to say and all the miraculous signs Yahweh had commanded him to do.",
