      "3": "So they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful, young woman. They found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "The woman was very beautiful. She became the king’s servant and took care of him, but the king did not make love to her.",
      "5": "Adonijah, son of Haggith, was very handsome. His mother gave birth to him after she had Absalom. Adonijah was boasting that he was king. So he got a chariot and horses and 50 men to run ahead of him.",
      "6": "His father had never confronted him by asking why he was doing this.",
      "7": "But Adonijah had discussed his actions with Joab (son of Zeruiah) and with the priest Abiathar, so they supported him.",
      "8": "But the priest Zadok, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the prophet Nathan, Shimei, Rei, and David’s thirty fighting men did not join Adonijah.",
      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel. He had invited all his brothers, the king’s other sons, all the men of Judah, and the king’s officials.",
      "10": "But he didn’t invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the fighting men, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "Then Nathan asked Solomon’s mother Bathsheba, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah, Haggith’s son, has become king, and our master David doesn’t even know about it?",
      "12": "Bathsheba, let me give you some advice about how to save your life and your son’s life.",
      "13": "Go to King David and ask him, ‘Your Majesty, didn’t you swear to me that my son Solomon will be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? Why is Adonijah acting as king?’",
      "14": "And while you’re still there talking to the king, I’ll come in and confirm what you have said.”",
      "15": "Bathsheba went to the king in his private room. The king was very old, and Abishag from Shunem was taking care of him.",
      "16": "Bathsheba knelt and bowed down in front of the king. “What do you want?” the king asked.",
      "17": "“Sir,” she answered, “You took an oath to Yahweh your Elohim. You said that my son Solomon will be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne.",
      "18": "But now, you see, Adonijah has become king, and you don’t even know anything about it, Your Majesty.",
      "19": "He has sacrificed many fattened calves, bulls, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army to his feast. But he hasn’t invited your servant Solomon.",
      "20": "All Israel is looking to you, Your Majesty, to tell them who should succeed you on your throne.",
      "21": "Otherwise, my son Solomon and I will be treated like criminals when you lie down in death with your ancestors.”",
      "22": "While she was still talking to the king, the prophet Nathan arrived.",
      "23": "The servants told the king, “The prophet Nathan is here.” When he came to the king, he bowed down in front of him.",
      "24": "Nathan said, “Your Majesty, you must have said that Adonijah will be king after you and that he will sit on your throne,",
      "25": "because today he went and sacrificed many bulls, fattened calves, and sheep. He invited all the king’s sons, the army’s commanders, and the priest Abiathar to his feast. They are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "But he didn’t invite me or the priest Zadok or Benaiah, who is Jehoiada’s son, or your servant Solomon.",
      "27": "Did you allow this to happen without telling me who would sit on your throne next?”",
      "28": "Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba in here.” So she stood in front of him,",
      "29": "and he swore an oath. He said, “I solemnly swear, as Yahweh who has saved my life from all trouble lives,",
      "30": "I will do today exactly what I swore to you by Yahweh Elohim of Israel. Your son Solomon will be king after me. He will sit on my throne.”",
      "31": "Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face touching the ground in front of the king. “May Your Majesty, King David, live forever!” she said.",
      "32": "King David said, “Summon the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, son of Jehoiada.” So they came to the king,",
      "33": "and he said, “Take my officials with you. Put my son Solomon on my mule, and take him to Gihon.",
      "34": "Have the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king of Israel there. Then blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "35": "Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will be king in place of me. I have appointed him to be the leader of Israel and Judah.”",
      "36": "“So be it!” Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, answered the king. “Yahweh your Elohim says so too.",
      "37": "As Yahweh has been with you, so may he be with Solomon. May Solomon be an even greater king than you, King David.”",
      "38": "Then the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites put Solomon on King David’s mule and brought him to Gihon.",
      "39": "The priest Zadok took the container of olive oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "40": "All the people followed him, blew flutes, and celebrated so loudly that their voices shook the ground.",
      "41": "Adonijah and all his guests heard this as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the horn, he asked, “What’s the reason for the noise in the city?”",
      "42": "He was still speaking when Jonathan, son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. “Come in,” Adonijah said. “You’re an honorable man, so you must be bringing good news.”",
      "43": "“Not at all,” Jonathan answered Adonijah. “His Majesty King David has made Solomon king.",
      "44": "The king has sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites with him. They have put him on the king’s mule.",
      "45": "The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon. They have come from there celebrating, so the city is excited. That is the sound you heard.",
      "46": "Solomon is now seated on the royal throne.",
      "47": "Furthermore, the royal officials have come to congratulate His Majesty King David, saying, ‘May your Elohim make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his reign greater than your reign.’ The king himself bowed down on his bed",
      "48": "and said, ‘Praise Yahweh Elohim of Israel who has let me see the heir to my throne.’”",
      "49": "Adonijah’s guests were frightened, so they got up and scattered in all directions.",
      "50": "Adonijah was afraid of Solomon. He got up, went to the tent of meeting, and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "Someone told Solomon, “Adonijah is afraid of you, King Solomon. He is holding on to the horns of the altar and saying, ‘Make King Solomon swear to me today that he will not have me killed.’”",
      "52": "Solomon said, “If he will behave like an honorable man, not one hair on his head will fall to the ground. But if he does anything wrong, he will die.”",
      "53": "King Solomon sent men to take him from the altar. Adonijah bowed down in front of King Solomon. “Go home,” Solomon told him."

      "5": "“You know what Joab (Zeruiah’s son) did to me and to the two commanders of Israel’s army—Abner, son of Ner, and Amasa, son of Jether. Joab killed them. When there was peace, he shed blood as if it were wartime. With their blood he stained the belt around his waist and the shoes on his feet.",
      "6": "Use your wisdom. Don’t let that gray-haired, old man go to his grave peacefully.",
      "7": "“Be kind to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead. Let them eat at your table. They helped me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom.",
      "8": "“Shimei, son of Gera from Bahurim in Benjamin, is still with you. He cursed me repeatedly when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came to meet me at the Jordan River, I took an oath by Yahweh and said, ‘As long as I’m king, I won’t have you killed.’",
      "9": "Now, don’t let him go unpunished. You are wise and know what to do to him: Put that gray-haired, old man into his grave by slaughtering him.”",
      "10": "David lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David.",
      "11": "He ruled as king of Israel for 40 years. He ruled for 7 years in Hebron and for 33 years in Jerusalem.",
      "12": "Solomon sat on his father David’s throne, and his power was firmly established.",
      "13": "Then Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Is this a friendly visit?” she asked.\n“Yes,” he answered.",
      "14": "Then he added, “I have a matter to discuss with you.”\n“What is it?” she asked.",
      "15": "He said, “You know the kingship was mine. All Israel expected me to be their king. But the kingship has been turned over to my brother because Yahweh gave it to him.",
      "16": "Now I want to ask you for one thing. Don’t refuse me.”\n“What is it?” she asked.",
      "17": "He said, “Please ask King Solomon to give me Abishag from Shunem as my wife. He will not refuse you.”",
      "18": "“Very well,” Bathsheba answered. “I will talk to the king for you.”",
      "19": "Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him on Adonijah’s behalf. The king got up to meet her and bowed down in front of her. Then he sat on his throne. He had a throne brought for his mother, and she sat at his right side.",
      "20": "“I’m asking you for one little thing,” she said. “Don’t refuse me.”\n“Ask, Mother,” the king told her. “I won’t refuse you.”",
      "21": "She replied, “Let Abishag from Shunem be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”",
      "22": "King Solomon then said, “Why do you ask that Abishag from Shunem be given to Adonijah? That would be the same as giving him the kingship. After all, he is my older brother. The priest Abiathar and Joab (Zeruiah’s son) are supporting him.”",
      "23": "King Solomon took an oath by Yahweh and said, “May Elohim strike me dead if Adonijah doesn’t pay with his life for this request!",
      "24": "Yahweh set me on my father David’s throne and gave me a dynasty as he promised. So I solemnly swear, as Yahweh who has established me lives, that Adonijah will be put to death today.”",
      "25": "King Solomon gave this task to Benaiah, son of Jehoiada. Benaiah attacked and killed Adonijah.",
      "26": "The king told the priest Abiathar, “Go to your land in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I won’t kill you at this time because you carried the ark of Adonay Yahweh ahead of my father David and because you shared all my father’s sufferings.”",
      "27": "So Solomon removed Abiathar as Yahweh’s priest and fulfilled Yahweh’s word spoken at Shiloh about Eli’s family.",
      "28": "The news reached Joab. (He had supported Adonijah, although he hadn’t supported Absalom.) So Joab fled to Yahweh’s tent and clung to the horns of the altar.",
      "29": "After King Solomon heard that Joab had fled to the altar in the tent of Yahweh, Solomon sent Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, to kill Joab.",
      "30": "When Benaiah came to the tent of Yahweh, he told Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out.’”\n“No,” Joab answered, “I’ll die here.”\nSo Benaiah reported to the king what Joab had said and how he had answered.",
      "31": "The king answered, “Do as he said. Kill him, and bury him. You can remove the innocent blood—the blood which Joab shed—from me and my father’s family.",
      "32": "Yahweh will repay him for the slaughter he caused. Joab killed two honorable men who were better than he was. He used his sword to kill Abner (who was the son of Ner and the commander of Israel’s army) and Amasa (who was the son of Jether and the commander of Judah’s army). Joab did this without my father’s knowledge.",
      "33": "The responsibility for their blood will fall on Joab and his descendants forever. But may David, his descendants, family, and throne always receive peace from Yahweh.”",
      "34": "Then Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, went and attacked Joab, killed him, and buried him at his home in the desert.",
      "35": "The king then appointed Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, to replace Joab as commander of the army. King Solomon also replaced Abiathar with the priest Zadok.",
      "36": "The king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem, and stay there. Don’t leave the city to go anywhere else.",
      "37": "But the day you leave and cross the brook in the Kidron Valley, you can be certain that you will die. You will be responsible for your own death.”",
      "38": "“Very well,” Shimei answered. “I’ll do just what Your Majesty said.”\nSo Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.",
      "39": "But after three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Gath’s King Achish, son of Maacah. Shimei was told that his slaves were in Gath,",
      "40": "so he saddled his donkey and went to Achish in Gath to search for his slaves. Shimei went to Gath and got his slaves.",
      "41": "After Solomon heard that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and back,",
      "42": "he summoned Shimei. Solomon asked him, “Didn’t I make you take an oath by Yahweh? Didn’t I warn you that if you left the city to go anywhere, you could be certain that you would die? Didn’t you say to me, ‘Very well. I’ll do just what you said’?",
      "43": "Why didn’t you keep your oath to Yahweh and obey the command I gave you?",
      "44": "Shimei, you know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Yahweh is going to pay you back for the evil you have done.",
      "45": "But King Solomon is blessed, and David’s dynasty will always be firmly established by Yahweh.”",
