      "5": "When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division of priests named after Abijah. Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron.",
      "6": "Zechariah and Elizabeth had God’s approval. They followed all the Lord’s commands and regulations perfectly.",
      "7": "Yet, they never had any children because Elizabeth couldn’t become pregnant. Both of them were too old to have children.",

      "57": "When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.",
      "58": "Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very kind to her, and they shared her joy.",
      "59": "When the child was eight days old, they went to the temple to circumcise him. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father.",
      "60": "But his mother spoke up, “Absolutely not! His name will be John.”",
      "61": "Their friends said to her, “But you don’t have any relatives with that name.”",
      "62": "So they motioned to the baby’s father to see what he wanted to name the child.",
      "63": "Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was amazed.",
      "64": "Suddenly, Zechariah was able to speak, and he began to praise God.",

      "67": "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,",
      "68": "“Praise the Lord God of Israel!\n    He has come to take care of his people\n        and to set them free.",

      "41": "Yeshua answered, “You unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”",
      "42": "While he was coming to Yeshua, the demon knocked the boy to the ground and threw him into convulsions.\nYeshua ordered the evil spirit to leave. He cured the boy and gave him back to his father.",
      "43": "Everyone was amazed to see God’s wonderful power.\nEveryone was amazed at all the things that Yeshua was doing. So he said to his disciples,",
      "44": "“Listen carefully to what I say. The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people.”",
      "45": "They didn’t know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them so that they didn’t understand it. Besides, they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.",
      "46": "A discussion started among them about who would be the greatest.",
      "47": "Yeshua knew what they were thinking. So he took a little child and had him stand beside him.",
      "48": "Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. The one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.”",
      "49": "John replied, “Master, we saw someone forcing demons out of a person by using the power and authority of your name. We tried to stop him because he was not one of us.”",
      "50": "Yeshua said to him, “Don’t stop him! Whoever isn’t against you is for you.”",
      "51": "The time was coming closer for Yeshua to be taken to heaven. So he was determined to go to Jerusalem.",
      "52": "He sent messengers ahead of him. They went into a Samaritan village to arrange a place for him to stay.",
      "53": "But the people didn’t welcome him, because he was on his way to Jerusalem.",
      "54": "James and John, his disciples, saw this. They asked, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to burn them up?”",
      "55": "But he turned and corrected them.",
      "56": "So they went to another village.",
      "57": "As they were walking along the road, a man said to Yeshua, “I’ll follow you wherever you go.”",
      "58": "Yeshua told him, “Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.”",
      "59": "He told another man, “Follow me!”\nBut the man said, “Sir, first let me go to bury my father.”",
      "60": "But Yeshua told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You must go everywhere and tell about the kingdom of God.”",
      "61": "Another said, “I’ll follow you, sir, but first let me tell my family goodbye.”",

      "59": "About an hour later another person insisted, “It’s obvious that this man was with him. He’s a Galilean!”",
      "60": "But Peter said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”\nJust then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.",

      "67": "“Tell us, are you the Messiah?”\nYeshua said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe me.",
      "68": "And if I ask you, you won’t answer.",
      "69": "But from now on, the Son of Man will be in the highest position in heaven.”",
      "70": "Then all of them said, “So you’re the Son of God?”\nYeshua answered them, “You’re right to say that I am.”",

      "3": "Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\n“Yes, I am,” Yeshua answered.",
      "4": "Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I can’t find this man guilty of any crime.”",
      "5": "The priests and the crowd became more forceful. They said, “He stirs up the people throughout Judea with his teachings. He started in Galilee and has come here.”",
      "6": "When Pilate heard that, he asked if the man was from Galilee.",
      "7": "When Pilate found out that he was, he sent Yeshua to Herod. Herod ruled Galilee and was in Jerusalem at that time.",

      "9": "Herod asked Yeshua many questions, but Yeshua wouldn’t answer him.",
      "10": "Meanwhile, the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings stood there and shouted their accusations against Yeshua.",

      "12": "So Herod and Pilate became friends that day. They had been enemies before this.",
      "13": "Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people.",
      "14": "He told them, “You brought me this man as someone who turns the people against the government. I’ve questioned him in front of you and haven’t found this man guilty of the crimes of which you accuse him.",
      "15": "Neither could Herod. So he sent this man back to us. This man hasn’t done anything to deserve the death penalty.",

      "35": "The people stood there watching. But the rulers were making sarcastic remarks. They said, “He saved others. If he’s the Messiah that God has chosen, let him save himself!”",

      "38": "He asked them, “Why are you afraid? Why do you have doubts?",
      "39": "Look at my hands and feet, and see that it’s really me. Touch me, and see for yourselves. Ghosts don’t have flesh and bones, but you can see that I do.”",
