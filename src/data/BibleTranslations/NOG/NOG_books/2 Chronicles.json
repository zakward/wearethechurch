      "1": "Solomon, son of David, strengthened his position over the kingdom. Yahweh his Elohim was with him and made him very powerful.",
      "2": "Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of regiments and battalions, judges, every prince, and the heads of Israel’s families.",
      "3": "Then Solomon and the entire assembly went to the place of worship in Gibeon because Elohim’s tent of meeting was there. Moses, Yahweh’s servant, had made the tent in the desert.",
      "4": "(However, David had already brought Elohim’s ark from Kiriath Jearim to a place he had prepared for it. He had put up a tent for it in Jerusalem.)",
      "5": "The bronze altar that Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was in front of Yahweh’s tent. There Solomon and the assembly worshiped Yahweh.",
      "6": "In Yahweh’s presence Solomon went to the bronze altar in front of the tent of meeting and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it.",
      "7": "That night Elohim appeared to Solomon. He said, “What can I give you?”",
      "8": "Solomon responded to Elohim, “You’ve shown great love to my father David, and you’ve made me king in his place.",
      "9": "Now, Yahweh Elohim, you’ve kept the promise you made to my father David. You’ve made me king of people who are as numerous as specks of dust on the ground.",
      "10": "Give me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people. After all, who can judge this great people of yours?”",
      "11": "Elohim replied to Solomon, “I know this request is from your heart. You didn’t ask for riches, fortunes, honor, or the death of those who hate you. You didn’t even ask for a long life. Instead, you’ve asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge my people, over whom I made you king.",
      "12": "So wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. I will also give you riches, fortunes, and honor like no other king before or after you.”",
      "13": "Solomon went from the tent of meeting at the place of worship in Gibeon to Jerusalem. And he ruled Israel.",
      "14": "Solomon built up his army with chariots and war horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 war horses. He stationed some in chariot cities and others with himself in Jerusalem.",

      "17": "They imported each chariot from Egypt for 15 pounds of silver and each horse for 6 ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Aramean kings."

I want to sacrifice burnt offerings every morning and evening, on weekly worship days, New Moon Festivals, and during the annual festivals appointed by Yahweh our Elohim. (These festivals are always to be celebrated by Israel.)",
      "5": "The temple I am building will be great because our Elohim is greater than all other gods.",

      "10": "I will give your lumberjacks 120,000 bushels of ground wheat, 120,000 bushels of barley, 200,000 gallons of wine, and 200,000 gallons of olive oil.”",
      "11": "Then King Huram of Tyre responded to Solomon by sending a letter that said, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he made you their king.”",
      "12": "Huram added, “May Yahweh Elohim of Israel be praised. He made the heavens and the earth and has given King David a wise son who has insight and intelligence and can build Yahweh’s temple and a royal palace.",
      "13": "And now, I’m sending a man with skill and intelligence—Huram Abi.",
      "14": "He was the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan, and his father is a native of Tyre. Huram knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, wood, purple, violet, and dark red cloth, and linen. He also knows how to make all kinds of engravings and follow any set of plans that will be given to him. He can work with your skilled workmen and the skilled workmen of His Majesty David, your father.",
      "15": "Your Majesty may now send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised the workers.",
      "16": "We will cut all the lumber you need in Lebanon. Then we will make rafts out of it and send them to you in Joppa by sea. You can take it from there to Jerusalem.”",
      "17": "Solomon counted all the men who were foreigners in the land of Israel, as his father David had counted them. Solomon counted 153,600 foreigners.",

      "7": "He also overlaid the building, the rafters, the threshold, the walls, and the doors with gold, and he carved angels into the walls.",

      "9": "The gold nails weighed 20 ounces. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.",
      "10": "In the most holy place he made two sculptured angels and covered them with gold.",
