  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and departed from evil.",
      "2": "And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.",
      "3": "His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses, and a very great store of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.",
      "4": "And his sons went and had banquets in their houses, each one on his day, and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
      "5": "And it was so, when the days of their banquets were over, that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.",
      "6": "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.",
      "7": "And the LORD said unto Satan, Where dost thou come from? Then Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.",
      "8": "And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my slave Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil?",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?",
      "10": "Hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands; therefore, his substance has increased in the land.",
      "11": "But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has, and thou shalt see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.",
      "12": "And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy power; only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.",
      "13": "And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;",
      "14": "and a messenger came unto Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;",
      "15": "and the Sabeans {Heb. those of Sheba} fell upon them and took them away; they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.",
      "16": "While he was yet speaking, another came who said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.",
      "17": "While he was yet speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans made three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.",
      "18": "While he was yet speaking, there another came and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;",
      "19": "and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.",
      "20": "Then Job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped",
      "21": "and said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.",
      "22": "In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.",
      "2": "And the LORD said unto Satan, Where dost thou come from? And Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it.",
      "3": "And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my slave Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and has departed from evil and that he still retains his perfection, although thou didst incite me against him to destroy him without cause.",
      "4": "And Satan answered the LORD and said, Skin for skin, all that a man has he will give for his life.",
      "5": "But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and thou shalt see if he does not blaspheme thee to thy face.",
      "6": "And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand, but preserve his life.",
      "7": "So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head.",
      "8": "And he took a potsherd to scratch himself with, and he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Blaspheme God and die.",
      "10": "But he said unto her, Thou hast spoken as any of the foolish women speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.",
      "11": "Now three friends of Job, Eliphaz, the Temanite, Bildad, the Shuhite, and Zophar, the Naamathite, when they heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.",
      "12": "And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept; and each one rent his mantle and sprinkled dust upon his head toward heaven.",
      "13": "So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.",
      "2": "And Job spoke and said,",
      "3": "Let the day perish in which I was born and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.",
      "4": "Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it.",
      "5": "Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.",
      "6": "As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.",
      "7": "O, let that night be solitary; let no song come therein!",
      "8": "Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.",
      "9": "Let the stars of its dawn be darkened; they waited for light, but have none; neither let them see the dawning of the day;",
      "10": "because it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb nor hide the misery from my eyes.",
      "11": "Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?",
      "12": "Why did the knees receive me? Of what use the breasts that I should suck?",
      "13": "For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,",
      "14": "with the kings and the counsellors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;",
      "15": "or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Or, why was I not hidden as an untimely birth, as infants who never saw light?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "There the prisoners rest together, they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.",
      "19": "The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;",
      "21": "who long for death, but it comes not; and search for it more than for hid treasures;",
      "22": "who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave;",
      "23": "to the man who does not know which way he goes and whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.",
      "25": "For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.",
      "26": "I never had prosperity, nor did I secure myself, neither was I at rest; yet trouble came."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz, the Temanite, answered and said,",
      "2": "If we attempt to commune with thee, thou wilt be grieved. But who can withhold himself from speaking?",
      "3": "Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.",
      "4": "Thy words have upheld the one that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.",
      "5": "But now that it is come upon thee, thou art grieved; it touches thee, and thou art troubled.",
      "6": "Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?",
      "7": "Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?",
      "8": "Even as I have seen, those that plow iniquity and sow wickedness, reap the same.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish, and by the spirit of his anger they are consumed.",
      "10": "The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.",
      "11": "The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.",
      "12": "Now the matter was also hidden from me, but my ear has perceived a little of it.",
      "13": "In imaginations of visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,",
      "14": "fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.",
      "15": "Then a spirit passed before me which caused the hair of my flesh to stand up.",
      "16": "A ghost stood in front of me, whose face I did not recognize, and I heard it say,",
      "17": "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?",
      "18": "Behold, he put no trust in his slaves, and his angels he charged with folly.",
      "19": "How much more with those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who shall be crushed by the moth!",
      "20": "They are destroyed from morning to evening; they perish for ever without anyone regarding it.",
      "21": "Does their beauty perish with them? They die and do not know."

    "5": {
      "1": "Call now, if there shall be anyone to answer thee; and if there shall be any of the saints for thee to look unto?",
      "2": "It is certain that wrath kills the foolish man, and envy consumes the covetous one.",
      "3": "I have seen the foolish taking root, but at the same time I cursed his habitation.",
      "4": "His sons are far from saving health, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and there shall be no one to deliver them.",
      "5": "The hungry shall eat up his harvest, and even take it out from among the thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up their substance.",
      "6": "For the iniquity does not come forth out of the dust; neither does chastisement spring up out of the ground;",
      "7": "yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "I would certainly seek God, and unto God would I commit my affairs;",
      "9": "who does great things that no one can understand, and marvels that have no explanation;",
      "10": "who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters abroad;",
      "11": "who sets up the humble on high, that those who mourn may be lifted up with saving health.",

      "13": "He takes the wise in their own prudence, and the counsel of his adversaries is turned to folly.",
      "14": "They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the night.",
      "15": "But he saves the poor from the sword, from the mouth of the wicked, and from the hand of the violent.",
      "16": "Who is the hope of the poor, and iniquity closes her mouth.",
      "17": "Behold, blessed is the man whom God chastens; therefore, do not despise not the correction of the Almighty.",
      "18": "For he makes sore, and binds up; he wounds, and his hands make whole.",
      "19": "He shall deliver thee in six tribulations, and in the seventh no evil shall touch thee.",
      "20": "In famine he shall ransom thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.",
      "22": "At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth;",
      "23": "for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.",
      "24": "And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent, and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin.",
      "25": "Thou shalt know that thy seed is great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.",
      "26": "Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like a shock of wheat that is gathered in its season.",
