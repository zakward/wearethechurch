      "2": "Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "3": "We must thank God always for you, brethren, as is due because your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of each and every one of you toward each other abounds,",
      "4": "so that we ourselves glory in you in the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure and",
      "5": "in testimony of the just judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer,",
      "6": "seeing it is a just thing with God to recompense tribulation to those that trouble you",
      "7": "and to give you, who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power,",
      "8": "with flaming fire, to take vengeance on those that do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
      "9": "who shall be punished with eternal destruction by the presence of the Lord and by the glory of his power,",
      "10": "when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all those that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.",
      "11": "Therefore in this manner we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of his calling and fill each will with goodness and the work of faith with power",
      "12": "that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be clarified in you, and ye in him, by the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."

      "1": "Now we beseech you, brethren, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together unto him,",
      "2": "that ye not be easily shaken in understanding or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as if the day of Christ is at hand.",
      "3": "Let no one deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,",
      "4": "opposing and exalting himself against all that is called God, or divinity, so that he as God sits in the temple of God, making himself appear to be God.",
      "5": "Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",
      "6": "And ye know what impedes this now, that he might be revealed in his time.",
      "7": "For the mystery of iniquity is already working, except that he who dominates now will dominate until he is taken out of the way.",
      "8": "And then shall that Wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth and remove with the clarity of his coming:",
      "9": "that wicked one, who shall come by the working of Satan with great power and signs and lying miracles,",
      "10": "and with all deception of iniquity working in those that perish because they did not receive the charity of the truth, to be saved.",
      "11": "Therefore, for this cause, God shall send the operation of error in them, that they should believe the lie;",
      "12": "that they all might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but consented to the iniquity.",
      "13": "But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to saving health through the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth,",
      "14": "unto which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "15": "Therefore, brethren, stand fast and retain the doctrine which ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.",
      "16": "Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given us eternal consolation and good hope through grace,",

      "3": "But the Lord is faithful, who shall confirm you and keep you from evil.",
      "4": "And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.",
      "5": "And the Lord make your hearts upright in the charity of God and in the hope of the Christ.",
      "6": "Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks out of order, and not after the doctrine which ye received of us.",
      "7": "For you know in what manner you ought to imitate us, for we did not walk disorderly among you,",
      "8": "neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought, but working with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,",
      "9": "Not because we did not have authority, but to give you an example that you might imitate us.",
      "10": "For even when we were with you, this we declared unto you, that if anyone desires not to work neither should he eat.",
      "11": "For we hear that there are some who walk among you out of order, not working at all, but are busybodies.",
      "12": "Now those that are such, we charge and exhort in our Lord Jesus Christ, that working with quietness, they eat their bread.",
      "13": "But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.",
      "14": "And if anyone does not hearken unto our word by this epistle, note that one and do not join with him, that he may be ashamed.",
      "15": "Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.",
      "16": "Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by every means. The Lord be with you all.",
