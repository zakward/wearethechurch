      "1": "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
      "2": "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD speaks, I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.",
      "3": "The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel does not know, my people do not have understanding.",
      "4": "O sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, generation of evildoers, corrupt sons! They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger; they have turned back.",
      "5": "Why should I chastise you any more? Ye will revolt more and more; every head is sick, and every heart faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in him; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.",
      "7": "Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.",
      "8": "And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.",
      "9": "Except the LORD of the hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Hear the word of the LORD, ye princes of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.",
      "11": "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? shall the LORD say. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats.",
      "12": "When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?",
      "13": "Bring no more vain oblations; the incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot stand them; iniquity and the solemn meeting.",
      "14": "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.",
      "15": "And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; likewise, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.",
      "16": "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;",
      "17": "learn to do good; seek judgment; restore unto the oppressed; hear the fatherless in right judgment; protect the widow.",
      "18": "Then come, shall the LORD say, and we shall be even; if your sins were as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow; if they were red like crimson, they shall become as wool.",
      "19": "If ye are willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;",
      "20": "But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.",
      "21": "How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.",
      "22": "Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:",
      "23": "Thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves; every one loves bribes and follows after rewards; they do not hear the fatherless in judgment, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.",
      "24": "Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of the hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries and avenge myself of my enemies;",
      "25": "and I will turn my hand upon thee and according to pureness purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin;",
      "26": "and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.",
      "27": "Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her converts with righteousness.",
      "28": "And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and those that forsook the LORD shall be consumed.",
      "29": "For ye shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the groves that ye have chosen.",
      "30": "For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf falls and as a garden that has no water.",
      "31": "And the strong idol shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and no one shall be able to quench them."

      "3": "And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.",
      "4": "And he shall judge among the Gentiles and shall rebuke many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.",
      "5": "O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.",
      "6": "Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.",
      "7": "Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:",
      "8": "Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:",
      "9": "And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself; therefore thou shalt not forgive them.",
      "10": "Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust from the terrible presence of the LORD and from the glory of his majesty.",
      "11": "The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.",
      "12": "For the day of the LORD of the hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:",
      "13": "And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of Bashan,",
      "14": "and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up,",
      "15": "and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,",
      "16": "and upon all the ships of Tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures.",
      "17": "And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.",
      "18": "And he shall utterly abolish the idols.",
      "19": "And they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth, because of the terrible presence of the LORD and because of the glory of his majesty when he shall arise to smite the earth.",
      "20": "In that day man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold (which they made each one for himself to worship) into the caves of the moles and of the bats,",
      "21": "to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the caverns of the cliffs from before the fearful presence of the LORD and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to smite the earth.",

      "7": "in that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be a healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: do not make me a ruler of the people.",
      "8": "For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings have been against the LORD, to irritate the eyes of his majesty.",
      "9": "The appearance of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves.",
      "10": "Say unto the righteous that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.",
