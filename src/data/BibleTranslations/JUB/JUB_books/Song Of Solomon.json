      "13": "the fig tree has put forth her green figs, and the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.",
      "14": "O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is beautiful.",
      "15": "Hunt the foxes for us, the little foxes, that spoil the vines; for our vines are in blossom.",
      "16": "My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feeds among the lilies.",
      "17": "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."
