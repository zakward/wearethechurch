  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "Now after the death of Joshua, it came to pass that the sons of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?",
      "2": "And the LORD said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hands.",
      "3": "And Judah said unto Simeon, his brother, Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanite; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hands, and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.",
      "5": "And they found Adonibezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanite and the Perizzite.",
      "6": "But Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.",
      "7": "And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered crumbs under my table; as I have done, so God has recompensed me. And they put him into Jerusalem, and there he died.",
      "8": "Now the sons of Judah had fought against Jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.",
      "9": "And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanite that dwelt in the mountains and in the Negev and in the plains.",
      "10": "And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba), and they slew Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher).",
      "12": "And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.",
      "13": "And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.",
      "14": "And it came to pass when he took her that he persuaded her to ask her father for land to cultivate. And she lighted from off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?",
      "15": "And she said unto him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.",
      "16": "And the sons of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah which is towards the Negev of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.",
      "17": "And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanite that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.",
      "18": "Also Judah took Gaza with its border and Askelon with its border and Ekron with its border.",
      "19": "And the LORD was with Judah, who drove out the inhabitants of the mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains, because they had chariots of iron.",
      "20": "And they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses had said, and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; thus the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.",
      "22": "And also those of the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.",
      "23": "And those of the house of Joseph put spies in Bethel (Now the name of the city before was Luz).",
      "24": "And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.",
      "25": "And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.",
      "26": "And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name of it Luz, which is its name unto this day.",
      "27": "Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns nor Taanach and its towns nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanite desired to dwell in that land.",
      "28": "And it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites under tribute but did not utterly drive them out.",
      "29": "Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite dwelt in Gezer among them.",
      "30": "Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanite dwelt among them and became tributaries.",
      "31": "Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho nor the inhabitants of Zidon nor of Ahlab nor of Achzib nor of Helbah nor of Aphik nor of Rehob;",
      "32": "to the contrary Asher dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land, for they did not drive them out.",
      "33": "Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of Bethanath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.",
      "34": "And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the mountain, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley.",
      "35": "And the Amorites desired to dwell in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they made them tributaries.",
      "36": "And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim from the rock and upward."

    "2": {
      "1": "And the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, I brought you up out of Egypt and caused you to enter into the land which I swore unto your fathers, and I said, I will never break my covenant with you",
      "2": "as long as ye make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; to the contrary, ye shall throw down their altars, but ye have not heard my voice; why have ye done this?",
      "3": "Therefore, I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.",
      "4": "And when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voice, and wept.",
      "5": "And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.",
      "6": "For Joshua had let the people go, and the sons of Israel had each gone unto his inheritance to possess the land.",
      "7": "And the people had served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the LORD that he had done with Israel.",
      "8": "And Joshua, the son of Nun, the slave of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old.",
      "9": "And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres in the mount of Ephraim on the north side of the mount of Gaash.",
      "10": "And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers, and there arose another generation after them which did not know the LORD nor the work which he had done to Israel.",
      "11": "And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baalim.",
      "12": "And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD to anger.",
      "13": "And they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth.",
      "14": "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.",
      "15": "Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said and as the LORD had sworn unto them; and thus they were greatly distressed.",
      "16": "Nevertheless, the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.",
      "17": "And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they fornicated after other gods and bowed themselves unto them; they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers had walked hearing the commandments of the LORD; but they did not do so.",
      "18": "And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of that judge; for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of those that oppressed them and afflicted them.",
      "19": "But when the judge was dead, then they would return, and corrupt themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them; they did not diminish from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.",
      "20": "And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he said, Because these people transgress my covenant which I commanded their fathers and do not hearken unto my voice;",
      "21": "neither will I drive out any longer from before them any of these Gentiles which Joshua left when he died,",
      "22": "that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD by walking therein as their fathers kept it, or not.",
      "23": "Therefore, the LORD left those Gentiles, without driving them out hastily; neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now these are the Gentiles which the LORD left, to prove Israel with them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;",
      "2": "he left them only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, and to teach them war, only for those that had known nothing before:",
      "3": "namely, five cardinals of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites that dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.",
      "4": "These, therefore, were left to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.",
      "5": "And as the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,",
      "6": "they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods.",
      "7": "And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and forgot the LORD their God and served the Baalim and the groves.",
      "8": "Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia, and the sons of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.",
      "9": "And when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour to the sons of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.",
      "10": "And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel and went out to war; and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.",
      "11": "And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.",
      "12": "And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.",
      "13": "And he gathered unto him the sons of Ammon and of Amalek and went and smote Israel and took the city of palm trees.",
      "14": "So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a saviour, Ehud, the son of Gera, a son of Jemini, {Benjamin} a man, who had his right hand impeded, and by him the sons of Israel sent a present unto Eglon, the king of Moab.",
      "16": "But Ehud had made himself a two-edged sword of a cubit length, and he girded it under his clothing upon his right thigh.",
      "17": "And he brought the present unto Eglon, king of Moab, and Eglon was a very fat man.",
      "18": "And when he had offered the present, he sent away the people that had brought the present.",
      "19": "But he, himself turned again from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word for thee, O king, who then said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.",
      "20": "And Ehud came unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. Then he arose out of his seat.",
      "21": "But Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon’s belly;",
      "22": "in such a manner that the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, and the excrement came out.",
      "23": "Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them.",
      "24": "When he was gone out, his slaves came; and when they saw that the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Peradventure he covers his feet in his summer chamber.",
      "25": "And having waited until they were confounded and he had not opened the doors of the parlour; therefore, they took a key and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.",
      "26": "But while they had waited, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the graven images and escaped unto Seirath.",
      "27": "And as he entered in, he blew the shofar in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.",
      "28": "Then he said unto them, Follow after me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands. And they went down after him and took the fords of the Jordan towards Moab and did not let anyone pass.",
      "29": "And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of war, and there escaped not a man.",
      "30": "So Moab was subjected that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.",
      "31": "And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad, and he also saved Israel."

      "1": "But the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD when Ehud was dead.",
      "2": "And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host was Sisera, and he dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.",
      "3": "And the sons of Israel cried unto the LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had mightily oppressed the sons of Israel for twenty years.",
      "4": "And a woman judged Israel at that time, Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth.",
      "5": "This Deborah dwelt under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.",
      "6": "And she sent and called Barak, the son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh of Naphtali and said unto him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded thee, saying, Go and draw toward Mount Tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?",
      "7": "And I will draw Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, unto thee to the river Kishon, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will deliver him into thy hands.",
      "8": "And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.",
      "9": "And she said, I will surely go with thee, but thy honour shall not be in the way that thou goest; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men on foot, and Deborah went up with him.",
      "11": "Now Heber, the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.",
      "12": "And the news came unto Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was gone up to Mount Tabor.",
      "13": "And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.",
      "14": "Then Deborah said unto Barak, Rise up, for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into thy hands. Is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him.",
      "15": "And the LORD broke Sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before Barak so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on foot.",
      "16": "But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, and there was not a man left.",
      "17": "And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a thick coverlet.",
      "19": "And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him to drink and covered him again.",
      "20": "Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and if anyone should come and enquire of thee and say, Is there anyone here? Thou shalt say, No.",
      "21": "Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took the tent stake, and putting a hammer in her hand, went softly unto him and smote the stake into his temples and fastened it into the ground, for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.",
      "22": "And as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he entered into where she was, behold, Sisera lay dead with the stake through his temples.",
      "23": "So God subjected on that day Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.",
      "24": "And the hand of the sons of Israel began to prosper and to prevail against Jabin, the king of Canaan until they had destroyed him."

      "3": "Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will praise the LORD God of Israel.",
      "4": "LORD, when thou didst go out of Seir, when thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped; the clouds also dropped water.",
      "5": "The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.",
      "6": "In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways ceased, and those that walked went astray through crooked paths.",
      "7": "The inhabitants of the villages ceased; they had ceased in Israel until I Deborah arose, I arose a mother in Israel.",
      "8": "When they chose new gods, the war was at the gates. Was there a shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?",
      "9": "My heart is toward the princes of Israel, those that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.",
      "10": "Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that preside in judgment, and walk by the way.",
      "11": "Because of the noise of archers, taken from among those that draw water, there they shall retell the righteousnesses of the LORD, even the righteousnesses of his villages in Israel. Now shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.",
      "12": "Rise up, rise up, Deborah; rise up, rise up, sing a song. Stand up, Barak and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.",
      "13": "Now he has made the remnant of the people to have dominion over the magnificent; the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.",
      "14": "Out of Ephraim came his root against Amalek; after thee, came Benjamin, against thy peoples; out of Machir came down princes; and from Zebulun, those that handle the pen of the writer.",
      "15": "Also princes of Issachar were with Deborah; and Issachar, like Barak, went on foot into the valley. From the divisions of Reuben, great are the thoughts of the heart.",
      "16": "Why didst thou abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? From the divisions of Reuben great are the searchings of the heart.",
      "17": "Gilead remained on the other side of the Jordan, and why did Dan remain next to the ships? Asher continued on the sea shore and remained in his breaches.",
      "18": "Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.",
      "19": "The kings came and fought; then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.",
      "20": "They fought from the heavens; the stars from their ways fought against Sisera.",
      "21": "The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. Tread down, O my soul, with strength.",

      "26": "She put her hand to the stake, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.",
      "27": "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead.",
      "28": "The mother of Sisera looked out the window and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?",
      "29": "Her wise princesses answered her; and she even answered to herself,",
      "30": "Have they not found spoil and are dividing it? To each man a damsel or two; to Sisera a spoil of different colours, a spoil of different colours of needlework, of different colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of those that take the spoil?",
      "31": "So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD, but let those that love thee be as the sun when he rises in all his might. And the land had rest forty years."
