      "13": "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you.",
      "14": "We know that we are passed from death unto life, in that we love the brethren. He that does not love his brother abides in death.",
      "15": "Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.",
      "16": "In this we have known the charity of God because he laid down his life for us; we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.",

      "3": "And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, of which ye have heard that it should come, and that now it is already in the world.",
      "4": "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.",
      "5": "They are of the world; therefore, they speak of the world, and the world hears them.",

      "8": "He that does not love does not know God, for God is charity.",
      "9": "In this was the charity of God demonstrated in us, in that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.",
      "10": "In this does the charity consist, not because we had loved God, but because he loved us and has sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins.",
      "11": "Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.",
      "12": "No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his charity is completed in us.",
      "13": "In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, in that he has given us of his Spirit.",

      "18": "In charity there is no fear; but charity that is perfect casts out fear; because fear has torment; from which he that fears is not complete in charity.",
      "19": "We love him, because he first loved us.",
      "20": "If anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?",
      "21": "And we have this commandment from him, That he who loves God loves his brother also."

      "3": "For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.",
      "4": "For whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.",
      "5": "Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?",
      "6": "This is Jesus, the Christ, who came by water and blood; not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is he that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.",
      "7": "For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.",
      "8": "And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one.",
      "9": "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.",
      "10": "He that believes in the Son of God has the witness of God in himself; he that does not believe God has made God a liar; because he does not believe the witness that God has testified of his Son.",
      "11": "And this is the witness, that God has given eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.",
      "12": "He that has the Son has life; and he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.",
      "13": "These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.",

      "16": "If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask God, and he shall give him life that is, unto those that do not sin unto death. There is sin unto death, for which I do not say that you should pray.",

      "19": "And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.",
      "20": "But we know that the Son of God is come and has given us understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.",
