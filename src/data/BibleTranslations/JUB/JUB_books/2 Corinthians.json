      "3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;",
      "4": "who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.",
      "5": "For in the same manner that the sufferings of the Christ abound in us, so also our consolation abounds by Christ.",
      "6": "And if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and saving health, which is effected in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and saving health.",
      "7": "And our hope of you is steadfast, being certain, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.",
      "8": "Because, brothers, we would not have you ignore our tribulation which was done unto us in Asia, that we were burdened beyond our strength, in such a manner that we despaired even of life:",
      "9": "But we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;",
      "10": "who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;",
      "11": "ye also helping us with prayer, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.",
      "12": "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly towards you.",
      "13": "For we write no other things unto you than what ye read or also know, and I trust ye shall know them even to the end",
      "14": "as also ye have known in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
      "15": "And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second grace",
      "16": "and to pass by you into Macedonia and to come again out of Macedonia unto you and of you to be sent forward to Judaea.",
      "17": "When I, therefore, was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that of me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?",
      "18": "But God is faithful that our word toward you has not been yes and no.",
      "19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, has not been yes and no, but in him was yes.",
      "20": "For all the promises of God are yes in him, and in him Amen, by us for the glory of God.",

      "3": "And I wrote this same unto you, lest when I came, I should have grief from those of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.",
      "4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know how much more charity I have towards you.",
      "5": "But if any have caused me grief, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not put a burden on you all.",
      "6": "Sufficient to such a one is this reprehension, which was inflicted of many.",
      "7": "So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with too much grief.",
      "8": "Therefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your charity toward him.",
      "9": "For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.",
      "10": "To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also; for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ,",
      "11": "lest Satan should deceive us, for we do not ignore his devices.",
      "12": "Having come to Troas for the gospel of the Christ, even though a door was opened unto me in the Lord,",
      "13": "I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.",
      "14": "Now thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.",
      "15": "For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in those that are saved and in those that perish;",
      "16": "to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?",
      "17": "For we are not as many, false merchandisers of the word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ."

      "3": "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.",
      "4": "And such trust we have through the Christ towards God:",
      "5": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,",
      "6": "who also has made us able ministers of the new testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.",
      "7": "But if the ministry of death in the letter engraved in stones was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to fade away,",
      "8": "How shall not the ministry of the Spirit be for greater glory?",
      "9": "For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, much more shall the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.",
      "10": "For even that which was so glorious had no glory in this respect, in comparison with the glory that excels.",
      "11": "For if that which fades away was glorious, much more shall that which remains be glorious.",
      "12": "Seeing then that we have such hope, we speak with great confidence,",
      "13": "And not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that glory which was to fade away:",
      "14": "(And thus their senses became hardened, for until this day remains the same veil not uncovered in the reading of the old testament, which veil is taken away in Christ.",
      "15": "But even unto this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.",
      "16": "Nevertheless when they convert to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.)",
      "17": "For the Lord is the Spirit, and where that Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",

      "3": "But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to those that are lost,",
      "4": "In whom the god of this age has blinded the understanding of those who do not believe, that the light of the gospel of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine in them.",
      "5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your slaves for Jesus’ sake.",
      "6": "For the God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts to bring forth the light of the knowledge of the clarity of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "But we have this treasure in clay vessels that the excellency of the virtue may be of God, and not of us.",

      "9": "persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;",
      "10": "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.",
      "11": "For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.",
      "12": "So then death works in us, but life in you.",
      "13": "We having the same Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed and, therefore, I have spoken; we also believe and, therefore, speak;",
      "14": "knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you.",
      "15": "For we suffer all these things for your sakes that the grace abounding through many may in the thanksgiving redound to the glory of God.",
      "16": "Therefore we fault not; but though our outward man is wearing out, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.",
      "17": "For our tribulation, which is momentary and light, prepares an exceeding and eternal weight of glory unto us;",
      "18": "while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."

      "3": "if so be that we shall be found clothed and not naked.",
      "4": "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, for we do not desire to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon with life swallowing up that which is mortal.",
      "5": "Now he that has made us for this same thing is God, who has likewise given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.",
      "6": "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord",
      "7": "(for we walk by faith, not by sight).",
      "8": "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.",
      "9": "Therefore we also procure, whether present or absent, that we may please him.",
      "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that each one may receive according to that which they have done in the body, good or evil.",
      "11": "Therefore being certain of that terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.",
      "12": "For we do not commend ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have something to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.",
      "13": "For whether we are fools, it is unto God; or whether we are sane, it is for your cause.",
      "14": "For the charity of the Christ constrains us because we judge thus: that if one died for all, then all are dead:",
      "15": "And that he died for all that those who live should not live from now on unto themselves, but unto him who died and rose again for them.",
      "16": "Therefore from now on we know no one according to the flesh: and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no longer.",
      "17": "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation: old things are passed away; behold, all things are made new.",
      "18": "And all this by God, who reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;",
      "19": "for certainly God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them and having placed in us the word of reconciliation.",
      "20": "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did exhort you by us; we beseech you in Christ’s name, be ye reconciled to God.",

      "6": "in chastity, in knowledge, in meekness, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned charity,",

      "15": "And what concord does Christ have with Belial? or what part do the faithful have with the unfaithful?",
      "16": "And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",

      "7": "and not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me so that I rejoiced the more.",
      "8": "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.",
      "9": "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry by God that ye might suffer no loss by us.",
      "10": "For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, of which there is no need to repented; but the sorrow of the world works death.",
      "11": "For behold this same thing, that when ye were made sorry by God, what carefulness it wrought in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things ye have shown yourselves to be clean in this matter.",
      "12": "So that, though I wrote unto you, I did it not only for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.",

      "8": "I speak not as commanding, but by occasion of the diligence of others and to prove the sincerity of your charity.",
      "9": "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be enriched.",
      "10": "And in this I give my advice, for this is expedient for you, who began not only to do, but also to be diligent a year ago.",
      "11": "Now therefore finish the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will, so there may also be a performance out of that which ye have.",
      "12": "For if there is first a willing desire, it is accepted according to what a person has and not according to what they do not have.",
      "13": "For I mean not that others be eased and ye burdened,",
      "14": "but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality:",
      "15": "As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered little had no lack.",
