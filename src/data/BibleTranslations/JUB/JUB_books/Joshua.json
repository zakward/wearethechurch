      "1": "Now after the death of Moses, the slave of the LORD, it came to pass that the LORD spoke unto Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,",
      "2": "Moses, my slave, is dead; now, therefore, arise, pass this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I give to the sons of Israel.",
      "3": "Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.",
      "4": "From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your borders.",
      "5": "No one shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.",
      "6": "Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land as an inheritance, which I swore unto their fathers to give them.",
      "7": "Only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest keep and do according to all the law, which Moses my slave commanded thee; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may be prospered in all the things that thou doest.",
      "8": "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may keep and do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way to prosper, and then thou shalt understand everything.",
      "9": "See that I command thee to be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for I, the LORD thy God, am with thee wherever thou goest.",
      "10": "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,",
      "11": "Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare food; for within three days ye shall pass this Jordan, to enter in to inherit the land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit.",
      "12": "Also to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,",
      "13": "Remember the word which Moses, the slave of the LORD, commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest and has given you this land.",
      "14": "Your wives, your little ones, and your beasts shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan; but ye, all the mighty men of valour, shall pass before your brethren armed and help them",
      "15": "until the LORD has given your brethren rest, as he has given you and they also inherit the land which the LORD your God gives them; then ye shall return unto the land of your inheritance and inherit it, which Moses the LORD’s slave has given you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising.",
      "16": "Then they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and wherever thou dost send us, we will go.",
      "17": "According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only let the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.",
      "18": "Whoever rebels against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou doest command him, let him die; only be strong and of a good courage."

      "2": "And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men of the sons of Israel have come here this night to spy out the land.",
      "3": "Then the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come unto thee, who have entered into thy house; for they are come to spy out all the land.",
      "4": "And the woman had taken the two men and hidden them and said thus, It is true that some men came unto me, but I did not know where they came from.",
      "5": "And at the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, these men went out, and I do not know where the men went; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.",
      "6": "But she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them among the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.",
      "7": "And the men pursued after them along the way to Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.",
      "8": "And before they went to sleep, she came up unto them upon the roof;",
      "9": "and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD has given you this land because the fear of you has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.",
      "10": "For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.",
      "11": "Hearing this has melted our heart, neither has there remained any more spirit in any man because of you, for the LORD your God is God above in the heavens and in the earth beneath.",
      "12": "Now, therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD since I have showed you mercy that ye will also do the same unto my father’s house, of which thou shalt give me a true sign,",
      "13": "and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death.",
      "14": "And the men answered her, Our life for yours if ye do not declare this our business. And it shall be when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal with thee according to mercy and truth.",
      "15": "Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.",
      "16": "And she said unto them, Go to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards ye may go your way.",
      "17": "And the men said unto her, We will be exempted of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear in the following manner.",
      "18": "Behold, when we come into the land, thou shall have bound this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by, and thou shall have brought thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father’s household home unto thee.",
      "19": "And it shall be that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless; and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any hand touches him.",
      "20": "And if thou should declare this our business, then we will be exempted of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.",
      "21": "And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.",
      "22": "And they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until their pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but did not find them.",
      "23": "So the two men returned and descended from the mountain and crossed over and came to Joshua, the son of Nun, and told him all the things that had befallen them.",
      "24": "And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands; and also all the inhabitants of the land are faint before us."

      "3": "and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place and go after it.",
      "4": "Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; do not come near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way before now.",
      "5": "And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.",
      "6": "And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.",
      "7": "And the LORD said unto Joshua, From this day I will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.",
      "8": "Therefore, thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are entered into the brink of the water of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.",
      "9": "And Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, Draw near and hear the words of the LORD your God.",
      "10": "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.",
      "11": "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes the Jordan before you.",
      "12": "Now, therefore, take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of each tribe a man.",
      "13": "And when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off; for the waters that come down from above shall stand in a heap.",
      "14": "And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass the Jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,",
      "15": "when those that bore the ark entered into the Jordan, as soon as the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water (for Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),",
      "16": "that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city of Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed and were cut off; and the people passed over right against Jericho.",
      "17": "But the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan until all the people finished passing the Jordan; and all Israel passed on dry ground."

      "4": "Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, out of each tribe a man;",
      "5": "and Joshua said unto them, Pass before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan and take ye up each one of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,",
      "6": "that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean unto you?",
      "7": "Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the sons of Israel for ever.",
      "8": "And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the LORD spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there.",
      "9": "Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there unto this day.",
      "10": "For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people made haste and passed.",
      "11": "And when all the people were finished passing, the ark of the LORD passed, and the priests, in the presence of the people.",
      "12": "And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh passed armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses had said unto them.",

      "19": "And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.",
      "20": "And Joshua raised up in Gilgal the twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan.",
      "21": "And he spoke unto the sons of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean unto you?",
      "22": "Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.",
      "23": "For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you until ye had passed, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us until we had passed,",

      "2": "At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.",
      "3": "And Joshua made himself sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.",
      "4": "And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people that had come out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, had died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.",
      "5": "Now all the people that had come out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt, were not circumcised.",
      "6": "For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the people that were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD; therefore, the LORD swore unto them that he would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.",
      "7": "But their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised by the way.",
      "8": "And when they had finished circumcising all the people, they abode in the same place in the camp until they were whole.",
      "9": "And the LORD said unto Joshua, Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore, the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.",
      "10": "And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal and celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plains of Jericho.",
      "11": "And they ate of the fruit of the land, unleavened cakes, on the next day after the passover and parched new ears of grain in the same day.",
      "12": "And the manna ceased on the next day after they had begun to eat of the fruit of the land; and the sons of Israel never had manna again; but they ate of the fruits of the land of Canaan that year.",
      "13": "And Joshua, being near Jericho, lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, Art thou one of us or one of our adversaries?",
      "14": "And he said, No, but I am the Prince of the host of the LORD; now I am come. Then Joshua falling upon his face in the earth worshipped him and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his slave?",
      "15": "And the Prince of the LORD’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou dost stand is holy. And Joshua did so."

      "1": "Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the sons of Israel; no one went out, and no one came in.",
      "2": "But the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given Jericho and its king into thy hand, with its mighty men of valour.",
      "3": "Therefore, ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, going round about the city once; and thou shalt do this six days.",
      "4": "And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven shofarot {or rams horns} of jubilee; and the seventh day ye shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the shofarot.",
      "5": "And when they make a long sound of jubilee with the horn so that ye hear the voice of the shofar, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat; then the people shall ascend up each man straight before him.",
      "6": "And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven shofarot of jubilee before the ark of the LORD.",
      "7": "And he said unto the people, Pass on and compass the city and let those that are armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.",
      "8": "And when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven shofarot of jubilee passed on before the LORD and blew with the shofarot; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.",
      "9": "And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the shofarot, and the congregation came after the ark, the priests going on and blowing with the shofarot.",
      "10": "And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, Shout; then ye shall shout.",
      "11": "So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.",
      "12": "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.",
      "13": "And the seven priests bearing the seven shofarot of jubilee before the ark of the LORD walked continually, and blew with the shofarot; and the armed men went before them; but the congregation came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on and blowing with the shofarot.",
      "14": "Likewise the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp; so they did for six days.",
      "15": "And on the seventh day they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.",
      "16": "And when the priests had blown the shofarot the seventh time, Joshua said unto the people, Shout, for the LORD has given you the city.",
      "17": "And the city shall be anathema unto the LORD, even it, and all the things that are in it; only Rahab, the harlot, shall live, she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent.",
      "18": "But keep yourselves from the anathema, that ye not touch nor take any thing of the anathema so that ye not make the camp of Israel anathema and trouble it.",
      "19": "For all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the LORD; they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.",
      "20": "Then the people shouted when the priests blew with the shofarot, and it came to pass when the people heard the voice of the shofar, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, each man straight before him and they took the city.",
      "21": "And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.",
      "22": "But Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman out of there with all that she has, as ye swore unto her.",
      "23": "And the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred and put them outside in the camp of Israel.",
      "24": "And they burnt the city with fire and all that was in it; only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.",
      "25": "And Joshua gave Rahab, the harlot, her life and also to her father’s household and to all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.",
      "26": "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD that rises up and builds this city Jericho. He shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.",
      "27": "So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame went throughout all the land."

      "1": "But the sons of Israel committed a trespass in the anathema; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the anathema; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the sons of Israel.",
      "2": "And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which was beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.",
      "3": "And they returned to Joshua and said unto him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people to labour there; for they are but few.",
      "4": "So about three thousand men of the people went up there; and they fled before the men of Ai.",
      "5": "And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down; therefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.",
      "6": "Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, putting dust upon their heads.",
      "7": "And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou caused this people to pass the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? We should have been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!",
      "8": "O Lord, what shall I say now that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!",
      "9": "For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall compass us around and cut off our name from upon the earth; then what wilt thou do unto thy great name?",
      "10": "And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get up; why dost thou lie thus upon thy face?",
      "11": "Israel has sinned and has even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the anathema and have also stolen and lied also, and they have even put it in their own vessels.",
      "12": "Therefore, the sons of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but shall turn their backs before their enemies because they have been in the anathema; neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the anathema from among you.",
      "13": "Get up, sanctify the people and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is anathema in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thy enemies until ye take away the anathema from among you.",
      "14": "In the morning, therefore, ye shall come near according to your tribes, and it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof, and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households, and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.",
      "15": "And it shall be that he that is taken in the anathema shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has because he has broken the covenant of the LORD and because he has wrought folly in Israel.",
      "16": "So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken;",
      "17": "and bringing near the tribe of Judah, the family of the Zarhites was taken; and bringing near the family of the Zarhites man by man, Zabdi was taken;",
      "18": "and he caused his household to come near, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",
      "19": "Then Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory now to the LORD God of Israel and give him praise; and tell me now what thou hast done; do not hide it from me.",
      "20": "And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.",
      "21": "When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.",
      "22": "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent and the silver under it.",
      "23": "And they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the sons of Israel and laid them out before the LORD.",
      "24": "Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had, and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.",
      "25": "And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? The LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.",
      "26": "And they raised over them a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day."

      "2": "And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king; only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof, ye shall take for yourselves. Lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.",
      "3": "So Joshua arose and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night.",
      "4": "And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city; do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.",
      "5": "And I and all the people that are with me, will approach the city; and when they come out against us, as at the first, we will flee before them",
      "6": "(for they will come out after us) until we have raptured them out of the city; for they will say, They flee before us as at the first. Therefore, we will flee before them.",
