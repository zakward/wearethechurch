      "1": "The elder unto the chosen lady and her sons, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those that have known the truth,",
      "2": "for the truthâ€™s sake, which abides in us and shall be with us for ever.",
      "3": "Grace be with you, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and charity.",
      "4": "I have rejoiced greatly, for I have found of thy sons that they walk in the truth, as we have received the commandment from the Father.",
      "5": "And now I beseech thee, lady, (not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning) that we love one another.",
      "6": "And this is charity, that we walk after his commandment. And this is the commandment, That ye walk in him, as ye have heard from the beginning.",
      "7": "For many deceivers are entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh. This same is a deceiver and antichrist.",
      "8": "Look to yourselves, that we not lose those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a fulfilled reward.",
      "9": "Whosoever rebels and does not abide in the doctrine of the Christ, does not have God. He that abides in the doctrine of the Christ, the same has the Father and the Son.",
      "10": "If anyone comes unto you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house neither say unto him, Welcome:",
      "11": "For he that says unto him, Welcome, is partaker of his evil deeds.",
      "12": "Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink, but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.",
      "13": "The sons of thy chosen sister greet thee. Amen."
