      "15": "My son, do not walk in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:",
      "16": "For their feet shall run to evil and make haste to shed blood.",
      "17": "Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.",
      "18": "And they lay in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own souls.",
