      "2": "and all the brethren who are with me, unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Galatia:",
      "3": "Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,",
      "4": "who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,",
      "5": "unto whom be the glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.",
      "6": "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel,",
      "7": "for there is not another; but there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of the Christ.",
      "8": "But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be anathema.",
      "9": "As we said before, so do I say now again, If anyone preaches any other gospel unto you than what ye have received, let him be anathema.",
      "10": "For do I now persuade men or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the slave of Christ.",
      "11": "But I make known unto you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not according to man.",
      "12": "For I did not receive it nor learn it from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
      "13": "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in Judaism, how that beyond measure I was persecuting and destroying the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God",
      "14": "And profited in Judaism above many of my equals in my own nation, being exceedingly more zealous of the traditions of my fathers.",
      "15": "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace,",
      "16": "to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,",
      "17": "neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus.",
      "18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen days.",
      "19": "But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord’s brother.",
      "20": "Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I do not lie.",
      "21": "Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia",
      "22": "and was unknown by face unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Judaea which were in Christ,",
      "23": "but they had only heard, That he who persecuted us in time past now preaches the faith which he once destroyed.",
      "24": "And they glorified God in me."

      "1": "Then fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me also.",
      "2": "But I went up by revelation and communicated unto them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who seemed to be of repute, to not run, or have run, in vain.",
      "3": "But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,",
      "4": "And that in spite of the false brethren, who entered secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage;",
      "5": "Unto whom we did not submit even for one hour that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.",
      "6": "But of these who seemed to be of repute, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God does not accept the appearance of men), for those who seemed to be of repute in conference added nothing to me;",
      "7": "But to the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter",
      "8": "(for he that showed himself forth in Peter for apostleship of the circumcision, the same also showed himself forth in me toward the Gentiles);",
      "9": "and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision.",
      "10": "Only they asked that we should remember the poor; the same which I was also diligent to do.",
      "11": "But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed.",
      "12": "For before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles, but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.",
      "13": "And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy.",
      "14": "But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, dost live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",
      "15": "We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",
      "16": "knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
      "17": "But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of our sin? No, in no wise.",
      "18": "For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a rebel.",
      "19": "For through the law I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.",
      "20": "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.",
      "21": "I do not reject the grace of God, for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."

      "1": "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that ye should not trust in the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?",
      "2": "This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the obedient ear of faith?",
      "3": "Are ye so foolish? having begun by the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?",
      "4": "Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.",
      "5": "He therefore that gives unto you the Spirit and does works of power among you, does he do it by the works of the law or by the obedient ear of faith?",
      "6": "Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.",
      "7": "Know ye therefore that those who are of faith, the same are the sons of Abraham.",
      "8": "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized Abraham in advance, saying, In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.",
      "9": "So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.",
      "10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.",
      "11": "But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident, for The just shall live by faith.",
      "12": "And the law is not of faith, but The man that does the commandments shall live by them.",
      "13": "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree),",
      "14": "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
      "15": "Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men) Even when a covenant is of man, once it is confirmed, no one cancels it or adds to it.",
      "16": "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He did not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.",
      "17": "And this I say that regarding the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel it, that it should make the promise of no effect.",
      "18": "For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.",
      "19": "For what then serves the law? It was added because of rebellions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made, and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.",
      "20": "Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.",
      "21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? No, in no wise, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.",
      "22": "But the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believers.",
      "23": "But before faith came, we were under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",
      "24": "Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
      "25": "But when faith is come, we are no longer under the hand of the schoolmaster.",
      "26": "For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.",
      "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.",
      "28": "Here there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.",
      "29": "And if ye are Christ’s, then ye are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Now I say That the heir, as long as he is a child differs in nothing from a slave, though he be lord of all,",
      "2": "but is under the hand of tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.",
      "3": "Even so we, when we were children, were in slavery under the elements of the world,",
      "4": "but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,",
      "5": "to redeem those that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",
      "6": "And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;",
      "7": "therefore, thou art no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.",
      "8": "However then, when ye did not know God, ye did service unto those who by nature are not gods.",
      "9": "But now, having known God, or rather being known of God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, in which ye desire again to be in slavery?",
      "10": "Ye observe days and months and times and years.",
      "11": "I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.",
      "12": "Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are; ye have not injured me at all.",
      "13": "Ye know how through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.",
      "14": "And my affliction which was in my flesh ye did not despise, nor reject but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "Where is then the blessedness ye spoke of? for I bear you record that if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me.",
      "16": "Am I, therefore, become your enemy because I tell you the truth?",
      "17": "They are zealous after you, but not for good; they would exclude you from us, that ye might be zealous after them.",
      "18": "It is good to be always zealous to do good, and not only when I am present with you.",
      "19": "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ is formed in you,",
      "20": "I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.",
      "21": "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, have ye not heard the law?",
      "22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.",
      "23": "But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, but he of the freewoman was born through the promise.",
      "24": "Which things are an allegory; for these women are the two covenants: the one from the Mount Sinai, which begat unto slavery, which is Hagar.",
      "25": "For this Hagar or Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which corresponds to the one that is now Jerusalem, which together with her children is in slavery.",
      "26": "But the Jerusalem of above is free, which is the mother of us all.",
      "27": "For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth into praise and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.",
      "28": "So that we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.",
      "29": "But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.",
      "30": "Nevertheless what does the scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.",
      "31": "So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."

      "2": "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye become circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",
      "3": "For I testify again to every man that becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.",
      "4": "Ye are empty of the Christ, whosoever of you that justify yourselves by the law; ye are fallen from grace.",
      "5": "For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.",
      "6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by charity.",
      "7": "Ye did run well; who hindered you that ye should not trust in the truth?",
      "8": "This persuasion does not come of him that called you.",
      "9": "A little leaven leavens the whole lump.",
      "10": "I have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will not be otherwise minded, but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.",
      "11": "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offence of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} ceased.",
      "12": "I even desire that those who trouble you would cut themselves off.",
      "13": "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only do not use liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by charity serve one another.",
      "14": "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
      "15": "But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye are not consumed one of another.",
      "16": "This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.",
      "17": "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.",
      "18": "But if ye are led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.",
      "19": "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",
      "20": "idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,",
      "21": "envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; which I denounce, as I have also told you in time past that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",
      "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is this: Charity, joy, peace, tolerance, gentleness, goodness, faith,",
      "23": "meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.",
      "24": "For those that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.",
      "25": "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.",

      "2": "Bear ye one another’s burdens and so fulfil the law of the Christ.",
      "3": "For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.",
      "4": "But let everyone prove his own work, and then he shall have glory regarding only himself, and not in another.",
      "5": "For everyone shall bear his own burden.",
      "6": "Let the one that is taught in the word communicate unto the one that teaches in all good things.",
      "7": "Do not deceive yourselves; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows that shall he also reap.",
      "8": "For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sows in the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.",
      "9": "And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.",
      "10": "Therefore as long as we have the opportunity, let us do good unto everyone, especially unto those who are of the household of faith.",
      "11": "Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.",
      "12": "As many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of the Christ.",
      "13": "For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh.",
      "14": "But in no wise should I glory, except in the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.",
      "15": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",
      "16": "And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",
      "17": "From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.",
