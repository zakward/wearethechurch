      "20": "Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the philosopher of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
      "21": "For in the wisdom of God, since the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.",

      "26": "For look upon your vocation, brothers, that ye are not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,",
      "27": "but rather God has chosen that which is the foolishness of the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen that which is the weakness of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;",

      "10": "But God has revealed this unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.",
      "11": "For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Even so no one has known the things of God, but the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that God has given us.",
      "13": "Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teaches, but with doctrine of the Holy Spirit, jointly fitting spiritual things by spiritual means.",
      "14": "But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand them because they are spiritually discerned.",
      "15": "But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he is discerned by no one.",

      "5": "Who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? but servants by whom ye believed, each one according to that which the Lord gave.",

      "10": "According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each one see how the building is built.",

      "14": "If the work of anyone abides which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.",
      "15": "If anyone’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.",
      "16": "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
      "17": "If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy that one; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you seems to be wise in this age, let them become a fool that they may be wise.",

      "4": "For although I have nothing on my conscience, yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judges me is the Lord.",
      "5": "Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each one have praise of God.",

      "7": "For who makes thee to judge? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, what dost thou glory of, as if thou hadst not received it?",
      "8": "Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye reign as kings without us, and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.",
      "9": "For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men.",
      "10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.",
      "11": "Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are ill clad and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place",
      "12": "and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;",
