      "2": "The same was in the beginning with the God.",
      "3": "All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.",
      "4": "In him was life, and the life was the light of men.",
      "5": "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",
      "7": "The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.",
      "8": "He was not the Light, but was sent to bear witness of the Light.",
      "9": "That Word was the true Light, which lightens every man that comes into this world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.",
      "11": "He came unto his own, and his own received him not.",
      "12": "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name,",
      "13": "who are not born of blood, nor of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John bore witness of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.",
      "16": "And of his fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.",
      "17": "For the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth of God came through Jesus, the Christ.",
      "18": "No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.",
      "19": "And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?",
      "20": "And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.",
      "21": "And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.",
      "22": "Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?",
      "23": "He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.",
      "24": "And those who were sent were of the Pharisees.",
      "25": "And they asked him and said unto him, Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?",
      "26": "John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there stands one among you, whom ye know not;",
      "27": "he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.",
      "28": "These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.",
      "30": "This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.",
      "31": "And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.",
      "32": "And John gave testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.",
      "33": "And I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.",
      "34": "And I have seen and have given testimony that this is the Son of God.",
      "35": "And again the next day John stood, and two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!",
      "37": "And the two disciples heard him speak and followed Jesus.",
      "38": "Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?",
      "39": "He said unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, brother of Simon Peter.",
      "41": "He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.",
      "42": "And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.",
      "43": "The day following Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee and found Philip and said unto him, Follow me.",
      "44": "Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.",
      "46": "And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see.",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, Behold a true Israelite, in whom is no guile!",
      "48": "Nathanael said unto him, From where dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.",
      "49": "Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.",
      "50": "Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.",
      "51": "And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."

      "1": "And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,",
      "2": "and Jesus and his disciples were also called to the marriage.",
      "3": "And being short of wine, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine.",
      "4": "Jesus said unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come.",
      "5": "His mother said unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.",
      "6": "And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.",
      "7": "Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "And he said unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the butler. And they bore it.",
      "9": "When the butler had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not where it was from (but the servants who drew the water knew), the butler called the bridegroom",
      "10": "and said unto him, Every man at the beginning sets forth the good wine, and when they are well satisfied, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.",
      "11": "This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.",
      "12": "After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples, and they continued there not many days.",
      "13": "And passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem",
      "14": "and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated;",
      "15": "and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overthrew the tables",
      "16": "and said unto those that sold the doves, Take these things away from here; do not make my Father’s house a house of merchandise.",
      "17": "Then his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house has consumed me.",
      "18": "Then the Jews answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?",
      "19": "Jesus answered and said unto them, Dissolve this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.",
      "20": "Then said the Jews, This temple was forty-six years in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?",
      "21": "But he spoke of the temple of his body.",
      "22": "Therefore when he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.",
      "23": "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, seeing the signs which he did.",
      "24": "But Jesus did not trust himself unto them because he knew all men",
      "25": "and needed not that any man should give testimony, for he knew what was in man."

      "1": "There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a prince of the Jews;",
      "2": "the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that thou doest unless God is with him.",
      "3": "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a person be born again from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.",
      "4": "Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb and be born?",
      "5": "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again from above.",
      "8": "The wind blows where it desires, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell from where it comes or where it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.",
      "9": "Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can this be done?",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not this?",
      "11": "Verily, verily, I say unto thee that we speak what we know and testify that which we have seen, and ye do not receive our witness.",
      "12": "If I have told you earthly things and ye do not believe, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?",
      "13": "And no one has ascended up to the heaven but he that came down from the heaven, even the Son of man, who is in the heaven.",
      "14": "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,",
      "15": "that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.",
      "16": "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.",
      "18": "He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
      "19": "And this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.",
      "21": "But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea, and he tarried there with them and baptized.",
      "23": "And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.",
      "24": "For John was not yet cast into prison.",
      "25": "Then there arose a question between the disciples of John and the Jews about purifying.",
      "26": "And they came unto John and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan of whom thou gave witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.",
      "27": "John answered and said, A man can receive nothing except it is given him from the heaven.",
      "28": "Ye yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.",
      "29": "He that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice; this my joy therefore is fulfilled.",
      "30": "It is expedient unto him to increase, but unto me, to decrease.",
      "31": "He that comes from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks earthly things: he that comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.",
      "33": "He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.",
      "34": "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit by measure unto him.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.",
      "36": "He that believes in the Son has eternal life, and he that does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."

      "4": "And it was necessary that he go through Samaria.",
      "5": "Then he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well; and it was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "There came a woman of Samaria to draw water; Jesus said unto her, Give me to drink.",
      "8": "(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)",
      "9": "Then said the Samaritan woman unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",
      "11": "The woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from where then hast thou that living water?",
      "12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof himself, and his sons and his cattle?",
      "13": "Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,",
      "14": "but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.",

      "17": "The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband;",

      "21": "Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father.",
      "22": "Ye worship what ye know not; we worship what we know, for saving health is of the Jews.",
      "23": "But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship him.",
      "24": "God is a Spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.",
      "25": "The woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah is to come, who is called the Christ; when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.",

      "27": "And upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with that woman; yet no one said, What askest thou? or, What talkest thou with her?",
      "28": "The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to those men,",
      "29": "Come, see a man who told me all that I have done; is perchance this the Christ?",
      "30": "Then they went out of the city and came unto him.",

      "32": "But he said unto them, I have a food to eat that ye know not of.",
      "33": "Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has anyone brought him anything to eat?",
      "34": "Jesus said unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.",
      "35": "Do ye not say, There are yet four months and then comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest.",
      "36": "And he that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.",
      "37": "And herein is that saying true, One sows and another reaps.",
      "38": "I have sent you to reap that upon which ye bestowed no labour; others laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.",
      "39": "And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him by the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I have done.",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they asked him to abide with them; and he abode there two days.",
      "41": "And many more believed by his own word",
      "42": "and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speech; for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.",
      "43": "Now after two days he departed from that place and went into Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country.",
      "45": "Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had also gone to the feast.",
      "46": "So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Then Jesus said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.",
      "49": "The nobleman said unto him, Sir, come down before my child dies.",
      "50": "Jesus said unto him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke unto him, and he went.",
      "51": "And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and told him, saying, Thy son lives.",
      "52": "Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.",
      "53": "So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son lives; and he believed, and his whole house.",

      "3": "In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.",
      "4": "For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water; whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.",
      "5": "And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said unto him, Dost thou desire to be made whole?",
      "7": "The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.",
      "8": "Jesus said unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.",
      "9": "And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked, and on that day was the sabbath.",
      "10": "The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.",
      "11": "He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.",
      "12": "Then they asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed and walk?",
      "13": "And he that was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.",
      "14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.",
      "15": "The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.",
      "16": "And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him: because he had done these things on a sabbath.",
      "17": "But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.",
      "18": "Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father do; for all that he does, this also the Son does together with him.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him all the things that he does, and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel.",
      "21": "For as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life; even so the Son gives life unto whom he will.",
      "22": "For the Father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the Son",
      "23": "that everyone should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.",
      "24": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death unto life.",
      "25": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.",
      "26": "For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself",
      "27": "and has also given him power and authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.",
      "28": "Marvel not at this, for an hour shall come when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,",
      "29": "and those that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but those that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.",
      "30": "I can of my own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.",

      "32": "There is another that bears witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.",

      "34": "But I receive not testimony from man, but I say these things that ye might be saved.",
      "35": "He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing to rejoice for one hour in his light.",
      "36": "But I have greater testimony than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me that the Father has sent me.",
      "37": "And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his appearance.",

      "45": "Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.",

      "3": "Simon Peter said unto them, I am going fishing. They said unto him, Let us also go with thee. They went forth and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing.",
      "4": "But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that it was Jesus.",
      "5": "Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have ye any food? They answered him, No.",
      "6": "And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right hand side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.",
      "7": "Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.",
      "8": "And the other disciples came in the little ship (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits), dragging the net with the fishes.",
      "9": "As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.",
      "10": "Jesus said unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.",
      "11": "Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three; and being so many, yet the net was not broken.",
      "12": "Jesus said unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.",
      "13": "Jesus then came and took the bread and gave them, and the fish likewise.",
      "14": "This was now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.",
      "15": "So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my lambs.",
      "16": "He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yes, Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my sheep.",
      "17": "He said unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.",
      "18": "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and carry thee where thou wouldest not.",
      "19": "This he spoke, signifying by what death he should clarify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, Follow me.",
      "20": "Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays thee?",
      "21": "Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?",
      "22": "Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry until I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.",
      "23": "Then this saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus did not say unto him, He shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry until I come, what is that to thee?",
      "24": "This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.",
      "25": "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I think that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
