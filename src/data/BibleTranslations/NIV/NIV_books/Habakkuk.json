      "1": "The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received.",
      "2": "How long, Lord, must I call for help,\n    but you do not listen?\nOr cry out to you, “Violence!”\n    but you do not save?",
      "3": "Why do you make me look at injustice?\n    Why do you tolerate wrongdoing?\nDestruction and violence are before me;\n    there is strife, and conflict abounds.",
      "4": "Therefore the law is paralyzed,\n    and justice never prevails.\nThe wicked hem in the righteous,\n    so that justice is perverted.",
      "5": "“Look at the nations and watch—\n    and be utterly amazed.\nFor I am going to do something in your days\n    that you would not believe,\n    even if you were told.",
      "6": "I am raising up the Babylonians,\n    that ruthless and impetuous people,\nwho sweep across the whole earth\n    to seize dwellings not their own.",
      "7": "They are a feared and dreaded people;\n    they are a law to themselves\n    and promote their own honor.",
      "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    fiercer than wolves at dusk.\nTheir cavalry gallops headlong;\n    their horsemen come from afar.\nThey fly like an eagle swooping to devour;",
      "9": "they all come intent on violence.\nTheir hordes advance like a desert wind\n    and gather prisoners like sand.",
      "10": "They mock kings\n    and scoff at rulers.\nThey laugh at all fortified cities;\n    by building earthen ramps they capture them.",
      "11": "Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—\n    guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”",
      "12": "Lord, are you not from everlasting?\n    My God, my Holy One, you will never die.\nYou, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment;\n    you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish.",
      "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil;\n    you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.\nWhy then do you tolerate the treacherous?\n    Why are you silent while the wicked\n    swallow up those more righteous than themselves?",
      "14": "You have made people like the fish in the sea,\n    like the sea creatures that have no ruler.",
      "15": "The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks,\n    he catches them in his net,\nhe gathers them up in his dragnet;\n    and so he rejoices and is glad.",
      "16": "Therefore he sacrifices to his net\n    and burns incense to his dragnet,\nfor by his net he lives in luxury\n    and enjoys the choicest food.",
      "17": "Is he to keep on emptying his net,\n    destroying nations without mercy?"

    "2": {
      "1": "I will stand at my watch\n    and station myself on the ramparts;\nI will look to see what he will say to me,\n    and what answer I am to give to this complaint.",
      "2": "Then the Lord replied:\n“Write down the revelation\n    and make it plain on tablets\n    so that a herald may run with it.",
      "3": "For the revelation awaits an appointed time;\n    it speaks of the end\n    and will not prove false.\nThough it linger, wait for it;\n    it will certainly come\n    and will not delay.",
      "4": "“See, the enemy is puffed up;\n    his desires are not upright—\n    but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness—",
      "5": "indeed, wine betrays him;\n    he is arrogant and never at rest.\nBecause he is as greedy as the grave\n    and like death is never satisfied,\nhe gathers to himself all the nations\n    and takes captive all the peoples.",
      "6": "“Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying,\n“‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods\n    and makes himself wealthy by extortion!\n    How long must this go on?’",
      "7": "Will not your creditors suddenly arise?\n    Will they not wake up and make you tremble?\n    Then you will become their prey.",
      "8": "Because you have plundered many nations,\n    the peoples who are left will plunder you.\nFor you have shed human blood;\n    you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.",
      "9": "“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,\n    setting his nest on high\n    to escape the clutches of ruin!",
      "10": "You have plotted the ruin of many peoples,\n    shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.",
      "11": "The stones of the wall will cry out,\n    and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.",
      "12": "“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed\n    and establishes a town by injustice!",
      "13": "Has not the Lord Almighty determined\n    that the people’s labor is only fuel for the fire,\n    that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?",
      "14": "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord\n    as the waters cover the sea.",
      "15": "“Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors,\n    pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk,\n    so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!",
      "16": "You will be filled with shame instead of glory.\n    Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed!\nThe cup from the Lord’s right hand is coming around to you,\n    and disgrace will cover your glory.",
      "17": "The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,\n    and your destruction of animals will terrify you.\nFor you have shed human blood;\n    you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.",
      "18": "“Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman?\n    Or an image that teaches lies?\nFor the one who makes it trusts in his own creation;\n    he makes idols that cannot speak.",
      "19": "Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’\n    Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’\nCan it give guidance?\n    It is covered with gold and silver;\n    there is no breath in it.”",
      "20": "The Lord is in his holy temple;\n    let all the earth be silent before him."

      "1": "A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth.",
      "2": "Lord, I have heard of your fame;\n    I stand in awe of your deeds, Lord.\nRepeat them in our day,\n    in our time make them known;\n    in wrath remember mercy.",
      "3": "God came from Teman,\n    the Holy One from Mount Paran.\nHis glory covered the heavens\n    and his praise filled the earth.",
      "4": "His splendor was like the sunrise;\n    rays flashed from his hand,\n    where his power was hidden.",
      "5": "Plague went before him;\n    pestilence followed his steps.",
      "6": "He stood, and shook the earth;\n    he looked, and made the nations tremble.\nThe ancient mountains crumbled\n    and the age-old hills collapsed—\n    but he marches on forever.",
      "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan in distress,\n    the dwellings of Midian in anguish.",
      "8": "Were you angry with the rivers, Lord?\n    Was your wrath against the streams?\nDid you rage against the sea\n    when you rode your horses\n    and your chariots to victory?",
      "9": "You uncovered your bow,\n    you called for many arrows.\nYou split the earth with rivers;",
      "10": "the mountains saw you and writhed.\nTorrents of water swept by;\n    the deep roared\n    and lifted its waves on high.",
      "11": "Sun and moon stood still in the heavens\n    at the glint of your flying arrows,\n    at the lightning of your flashing spear.",
      "12": "In wrath you strode through the earth\n    and in anger you threshed the nations.",
      "13": "You came out to deliver your people,\n    to save your anointed one.\nYou crushed the leader of the land of wickedness,\n    you stripped him from head to foot.",
      "14": "With his own spear you pierced his head\n    when his warriors stormed out to scatter us,\ngloating as though about to devour\n    the wretched who were in hiding.",
      "15": "You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    churning the great waters.",
      "16": "I heard and my heart pounded,\n    my lips quivered at the sound;\ndecay crept into my bones,\n    and my legs trembled.\nYet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity\n    to come on the nation invading us.",
      "17": "Though the fig tree does not bud\n    and there are no grapes on the vines,\nthough the olive crop fails\n    and the fields produce no food,\nthough there are no sheep in the pen\n    and no cattle in the stalls,",
      "18": "yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\n    I will be joyful in God my Savior.",
      "19": "The Sovereign Lord is my strength;\n    he makes my feet like the feet of a deer,\n    he enables me to tread on the heights.\nFor the director of music. On my stringed instruments."
