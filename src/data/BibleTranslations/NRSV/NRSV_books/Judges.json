    "1": {
      "1": "After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the Lord, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”",
      "2": "The Lord said, “Judah shall go up. I hereby give the land into his hand.”",
      "3": "Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; then I, too, will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "Then Judah went up, and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.",
      "5": "They came upon Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.",
      "6": "Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has paid me back.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "Then the people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.",
      "9": "Afterward the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.",
      "10": "Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.",
      "11": "From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher).",
      "12": "Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as wife.”",
      "13": "And Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, and he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.",
      "14": "When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”",
      "15": "She said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also Gulloth-mayim.” So Caleb gave her Upper Gulloth and Lower Gulloth.",
      "16": "The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses’s father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad. Then they went and settled with the Amalekites.",
      "17": "Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the city was called Hormah.",
      "18": "Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.",
      "19": "The Lord was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country but could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.",
      "20": "Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "But the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived in Jerusalem among the Benjaminites to this day.",
      "22": "The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "The house of Joseph sent out spies to Bethel (the name of the city was formerly Luz).",
      "24": "When the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”",
      "25": "So he showed them the way into the city, and they put the city to the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.",
      "26": "So the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz; that is its name to this day.",
      "27": "Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, but the Canaanites continued to live in that land.",
      "28": "When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not in fact drive them out.",
      "29": "And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.",
      "30": "Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor.",
      "31": "Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Mahalab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob,",
      "32": "but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.",
      "33": "Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth-anath but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.",
      "34": "The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country; they did not allow them to come down to the plain.",
      "35": "The Amorites continued to live in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.",
      "36": "The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward."

    "2": {
      "1": "Now the angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I had promised to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.",
      "2": "For your part, do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my command. See what you have done!",
      "3": "So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you.”",
      "4": "When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept.",
      "5": "So they named that place Bochim, and there they sacrificed to the Lord.",
      "6": "When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites all went to their own inheritances to take possession of the land.",
      "7": "The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel.",
      "8": "Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred ten years.",
      "9": "So they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "Moreover, that whole generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation grew up after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "Then the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals,",
      "12": "and they abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were all around them and bowed down to them, and they provoked the Lord to anger.",
      "13": "They abandoned the Lord and served Baal and the Astartes.",
      "14": "So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers who plundered them, and he sold them into the power of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.",
      "15": "Whenever they marched out, the hand of the Lord was against them to bring misfortune, as the Lord had warned them and sworn to them, and they were in great distress.",
      "16": "Then the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the power of those who plundered them.",
      "17": "Yet they did not listen even to their judges, for they lusted after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their ancestors had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord; they did not follow their example.",
      "18": "Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, for the Lord would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those who persecuted and oppressed them.",
      "19": "But whenever the judge died, they would relapse and behave worse than their ancestors, following other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They would not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.",
      "20": "So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said, “Because this nation has transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors and have not obeyed my voice,",
      "21": "I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.”",
      "22": "In order to test Israel, whether or not they would take care to walk in the way of the Lord as their ancestors did,",
      "23": "the Lord had left those nations, not driving them out at once, and had not handed them over to Joshua."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now these are the nations that the Lord left to test all those in Israel who had no experience of war in Canaan",
      "2": "(it was only for successive generations of Israelites, to teach war to those who had no experience of it):",
      "3": "the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.",
      "4": "They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the Lord that he commanded their ancestors by Moses.",
      "5": "So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,",
      "6": "and they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.",
      "7": "The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, forgetting the Lord their God and serving the Baals and the Asherahs.",
      "8": "Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim, and the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.",
      "9": "But when the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the Israelites who delivered them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.",
      "10": "The spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and the Lord gave King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram into his hand, and his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.",
      "11": "So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord.",
      "13": "In alliance with the Ammonites and the Amalekites, he went and defeated Israel, and they took possession of the city of palms.",
      "14": "So the Israelites served King Eglon of Moab eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The Israelites sent tribute by him to King Eglon of Moab.",
      "16": "Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he fastened it on his right thigh under his clothes.",
      "17": "Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.",
      "18": "When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent the people who carried the tribute on their way.",
      "19": "But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” So the king said, “Silence!” and all his attendants went out from his presence.",
      "20": "Ehud came to him, while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber, and said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he rose from his seat.",
      "21": "Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly;",
      "22": "the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and the dirt came out.",
      "23": "Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and closed the doors of the roof chamber on him and locked them.",
      "24": "After he had gone, the servants came. When they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “He must be relieving himself in the cool chamber.”",
      "25": "So they waited until they were embarrassed. When he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them. There was their lord lying dead on the floor.",
      "26": "Ehud escaped while they delayed and passed beyond the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah.",
      "27": "When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.",
      "28": "He said to them, “Follow after me, for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and allowed no one to cross over.",
      "29": "At that time they killed about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; no one escaped.",
      "30": "So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.",
      "31": "After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad. He, too, delivered Israel."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, after Ehud died.",
      "2": "So the Lord sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim.",
      "3": "Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord for help, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.",
      "4": "At that time Deborah, a prophet, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel.",
      "5": "She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came up to her for judgment.",
      "6": "She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The Lord, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Position yourself at Mount Tabor, taking ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun.",
      "7": "I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand.’ ”",
      "8": "Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”",
      "9": "And she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand warriors went up behind him, and Deborah went up with him.",
      "11": "Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, that is, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had encamped as far away as Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.",
      "12": "When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
      "13": "Sisera called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the troops who were with him, from Harosheth-ha-goiim to the Wadi Kishon.",
      "14": "Then Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day on which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Has not the Lord gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand warriors following him.",
      "15": "And the Lord threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into a panic before Barak; Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot,",
      "16": "while Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-ha-goiim. All the army of Sisera fell by the sword; not one was left.",
      "17": "Now Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the clan of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.",
      "19": "Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.",
      "20": "He said to her, “Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anybody comes and asks you, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’ ”",
      "21": "But Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, until it went down into the ground—he was lying fast asleep from weariness—and he died.",
      "22": "Then, as Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he went into her tent, and there was Sisera lying dead, with the tent peg in his temple.",
      "23": "So on that day God subdued King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites.",
      "24": "Then the hand of the Israelites bore harder and harder on King Jabin of Canaan, until they destroyed King Jabin of Canaan."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day,",
      "2": "“When locks are long in Israel,\n    when the people offer themselves willingly—\n    bless the Lord!",
      "3": "Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes;\n    to the Lord I will sing;\n    I will make melody to the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "4": "Lord, when you went out from Seir,\n    when you marched from the region of Edom,\nthe earth trembled,\n    and the heavens poured;\n    the clouds indeed poured water.",
      "5": "The mountains quaked before the Lord, the One of Sinai,\n    before the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "6": "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,\n    in the days of Jael, caravans ceased,\n    and travelers kept to the byways.",
      "7": "The peasantry prospered in Israel;\n    they grew fat on plunder,\nbecause you arose, Deborah,\n    arose as a mother in Israel.",
      "8": "When new gods were chosen,\n    then war was in the gates.\nWas shield or spear to be seen\n    among forty thousand in Israel?",
      "9": "My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel\n    who offered themselves willingly among the people.\n    Bless the Lord.",
      "10": "Sing of it, you who ride on white donkeys,\n    you who sit on rich carpets,\n    and you who walk by the way.",
      "11": "To the sound of musicians at the watering places,\n    there they repeat the triumphs of the Lord,\n    the triumphs of his peasantry in Israel.\nThen down to the gates marched the people of the Lord.",
      "12": "Awake, awake, Deborah!\n    Awake, awake, utter a song!\nArise, Barak, lead away your captives,\n    O son of Abinoam.",
      "13": "Then down marched the remnant of the nobles;\n    the people of the Lord marched down for him against the mighty.",
      "14": "From Ephraim they set out into the valley,\n    following you, Benjamin, with your kin;\nfrom Machir marched down the commanders,\n    and from Zebulun those who bear the marshal’s staff;",
      "15": "the chiefs of Issachar came with Deborah,\n    and Issachar faithful to Barak;\n    into the valley they rushed out at his heels.\nAmong the clans of Reuben\n    there were great searchings of heart.",
      "16": "Why did you tarry among the sheepfolds,\n    to hear the piping for the flocks?\nAmong the clans of Reuben\n    there were great searchings of heart.",
      "17": "Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan,\n    and Dan, why did he abide with the ships?\nAsher sat still at the coast of the sea,\n    settling down by his landings.",
      "18": "Zebulun is a people that scorned death;\n    Naphtali, too, on the heights of the field.",
      "19": "The kings came; they fought;\n    then fought the kings of Canaan,\nat Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo;\n    they got no spoils of silver.",
      "20": "The stars fought from heaven;\n    from their courses they fought against Sisera.",
      "21": "The torrent Kishon swept them away,\n    the onrushing torrent, the torrent Kishon.\n    March on, my soul, with might!",
      "22": "Then loud beat the horses’ hoofs\n    with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.",
      "23": "Curse Meroz, says the angel of the Lord;\n    curse bitterly its inhabitants,\nbecause they did not come to the help of the Lord,\n    to the help of the Lord against the mighty.",
      "24": "Most blessed of women be Jael,\n    the wife of Heber the Kenite,\n    of tent-dwelling women most blessed.",
      "25": "Water he asked, milk she gave;\n    she brought him curds in a lordly bowl.",
      "26": "She put her hand to the tent peg\n    and her right hand to the workers’ mallet;\nshe struck Sisera a blow;\n    she crushed his head;\n    she shattered and pierced his temple.",
      "27": "Between her feet he sank, he fell,\n    he lay still;\nbetween her feet he sank, he fell;\n    where he sank, there he fell dead.",
      "28": "Out of the window she peered;\n    the mother of Sisera gazed through the lattice:\n‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?\n    Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?’",
      "29": "Her wisest ladies make answer;\n    indeed, she answers the question herself:",
      "30": "‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?\n    A woman or two for every man;\nspoil of dyed stuffs for Sisera,\n    spoil of dyed stuffs embroidered,\n    two pieces of dyed work embroidered for my neck as spoil?’",
      "31": "So perish all your enemies, O Lord!\n    But may your friends be like the sun as it rises in its might.”\nAnd the land had rest forty years."

      "2": "The hand of Midian prevailed over Israel, and because of Midian the Israelites provided for themselves hiding places in the mountains, caves and strongholds.",
      "3": "For whenever the Israelites put in seed, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east would come up against them.",
      "4": "They would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, nor any sheep or ox or donkey.",

      "22": "Then Gideon perceived that it was the angel of the Lord, and Gideon said, “Help me, Lord God! For I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.”",
      "23": "But the Lord said to him, “Peace be to you; do not fear; you shall not die.”",
      "24": "Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, “The Lord is peace.” To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.",
      "25": "That night the Lord said to him, “Take your father’s bull, the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father and cut down the sacred pole that is beside it",

      "16": "While the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate,",
      "17": "the five men who had gone to spy out the land proceeded to enter and take the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim. The priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.",
      "18": "When the men went into Micah’s house and took the idol of cast metal, the ephod, and the teraphim, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”",
      "19": "They said to him, “Keep quiet! Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one person or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”",
      "20": "Then the priest accepted the offer. He took the ephod, the teraphim, and the idol and went along with the people.",

      "22": "When they were some distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the Danites.",
      "23": "They shouted to the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter that you come with such a company?”",
      "24": "He replied, “You take my gods that I made and the priest and go away, and what have I left? How then can you ask me, ‘What is the matter?’ ”",
      "25": "And the Danites said to him, “You had better not let your voice be heard among us, or else hot-tempered fellows will attack you, and you will lose your life and the lives of your household.”",
      "26": "Then the Danites went their way. When Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.",
      "27": "The Danites, having taken what Micah had made and the priest who belonged to him, came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, put them to the sword, and burned down the city.",
      "28": "There was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with Aram. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it.",
      "29": "They named the city Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel, but the name of the city was formerly Laish.",
      "30": "Then the Danites set up the idol for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom son of Moses and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the time the land went into captivity.",
      "31": "So they maintained as their own Micah’s idol that he had made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh."
