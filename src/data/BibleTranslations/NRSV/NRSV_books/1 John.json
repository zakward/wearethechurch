      "8": "the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree.",
      "9": "If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son.",
      "10": "Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.",
