      "3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,",
      "4": "to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn’t fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,",
      "5": "who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.",
      "6": "In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved in various trials,",
      "7": "that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ—",
      "8": "whom, not having known, you love. In him, though now you don’t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory,",
      "9": "receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.",
      "10": "Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently. They prophesied of the grace that would come to you,",
      "11": "searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow them.",
      "12": "To them it was revealed that they served not themselves, but you, in these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.",
      "13": "Therefore prepare your minds for action. Be sober, and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ—",
      "14": "as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,",
      "15": "but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior,",
      "16": "because it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”",
      "17": "If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man’s work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear,",
      "18": "knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things like silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,",
      "19": "but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish or spot, the blood of Christ,",
      "20": "who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in this last age for your sake,",
      "21": "who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.",

      "5": "You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.",

      "7": "For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient,\n“The stone which the builders rejected\n    has become the chief cornerstone,”",
      "8": "and,\n“a stumbling stone and a rock of offense.”\nFor they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.",
      "9": "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.",
      "10": "In the past, you were not a people, but now are God’s people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.",

      "12": "having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.",
      "13": "Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme,",
      "14": "or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.",
      "15": "For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.",
      "16": "Live as free people, yet not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.",
      "17": "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.",
      "18": "Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.",
      "19": "For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.",
      "20": "For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.",
      "21": "For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,",
      "22": "who didn’t sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth.”",
      "23": "When he was cursed, he didn’t curse back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.",
      "24": "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed by his wounds.",

      "3": "Let your beauty come not from the outward adorning of braiding your hair, and of wearing gold ornaments or of putting on fine clothing,",
      "4": "but from the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God’s sight.",
      "5": "For this is how in the past the holy women who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands.",
      "6": "So Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are if you do well and are not put in fear by any terror.",
      "7": "You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman as to the weaker vessel, as also being joint heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.",

      "10": "For,\n“He who would love life\n    and see good days,\nlet him keep his tongue from evil\n    and his lips from speaking deceit.",
      "11": "Let him turn away from evil and do good.\n    Let him seek peace and pursue it.",
      "12": "For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,\n    and his ears open to their prayer;\n    but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”",
      "13": "Now who will harm you if you become imitators of that which is good?",
      "14": "But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Don’t fear what they fear, neither be troubled.”",
      "15": "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear,",
      "16": "having a good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ.",
      "17": "For it is better, if it is God’s will, that you suffer for doing what is right than for doing evil.",
      "18": "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit,",
      "19": "in whom he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,",
      "20": "who before were disobedient when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.",
      "21": "This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,",

      "3": "For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.",
      "4": "They think it is strange that you don’t run with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.",
      "5": "They will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.",
      "6": "For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.",
      "7": "But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.",
      "8": "And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.",

      "18": "“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?”",
      "19": "Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator."
