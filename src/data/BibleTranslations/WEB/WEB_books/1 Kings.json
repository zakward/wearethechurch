      "48": "Also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne today, my eyes even seeing it.’”",
      "49": "All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way.",
      "50": "Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and hung onto the horns of the altar.",

But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the Lord Yahweh’s ark before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.”",
