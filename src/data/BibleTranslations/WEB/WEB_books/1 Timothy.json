      "3": "As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,",
      "4": "and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith.",
      "5": "But the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith,",
      "6": "from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking,",
      "7": "desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly affirm.",
      "8": "But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully,",
      "9": "as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,",
      "10": "for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,",

      "12": "I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service,",
      "13": "although I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.",
      "14": "The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.",
      "16": "However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.",
      "17": "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.",
      "18": "I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,",
      "19": "holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,",

      "7": "to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.",
      "8": "I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.",
      "9": "In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,",
      "10": "but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.",
      "11": "Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.",
      "12": "But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.",

      "4": "one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;",

      "7": "Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.",
      "8": "Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money,",
      "9": "holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.",
      "10": "Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless.",
      "11": "Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, and faithful in all things.",
      "12": "Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.",
      "13": "For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly,",
      "15": "but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.",
      "16": "Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:\nGod was revealed in the flesh,\njustified in the spirit,\nseen by angels,\npreached among the nations,\nbelieved on in the world,\nand received up in glory."

      "3": "forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.",
      "4": "For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.",
      "5": "For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.",
      "6": "If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.",
      "7": "But refuse profane and old wives’ fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness.",
      "8": "For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now and of that which is to come.",
      "9": "This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.",
      "10": "For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.",

      "4": "But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own family and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.",
      "5": "Now she who is a widow indeed and desolate, has her hope set on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.",
      "6": "But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.",

      "15": "For already some have turned away after Satan.",
      "16": "If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.",
      "17": "Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.",
      "18": "For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.” And, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”",

      "22": "Lay hands hastily on no one. Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself pure.",
      "23": "Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.",
      "24": "Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.",

      "3": "If anyone teaches a different doctrine and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,",
      "4": "he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions,",
      "5": "constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.",
      "6": "But godliness with contentment is great gain.",
      "7": "For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out.",
      "8": "But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.",
      "9": "But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.",
      "10": "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.",
