      "3": "I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day",
      "4": "longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;",
      "5": "having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.",
      "6": "For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.",
      "7": "For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.",
      "8": "Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,",
      "9": "who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,",
      "10": "but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.",
      "11": "For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.",
      "12": "For this cause I also suffer these things.\nYet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.",
      "13": "Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.",
      "15": "This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.",
      "16": "May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,",
      "17": "but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me",

      "10": "Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.",
      "11": "This saying is trustworthy:\n“For if we died with him,\n    we will also live with him.",
      "12": "If we endure,\n    we will also reign with him.\nIf we deny him,\n    he also will deny us.",
      "13": "If we are faithless,\n    he remains faithful;\n    for he can’t deny himself.”",
      "14": "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.",
      "15": "Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.",
      "16": "But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,",
      "17": "and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:",
      "18": "men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.",
      "19": "However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”",
      "20": "Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor.",

      "22": "Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.",
      "23": "But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.",
      "24": "The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,",
      "25": "in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,",

      "3": "without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,",
      "4": "traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,",
      "5": "holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.",
      "6": "For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,",
      "7": "always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
      "8": "Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.",
      "9": "But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.",
      "10": "But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,",
      "11": "persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.",
      "12": "Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.",
      "13": "But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.",
      "14": "But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.",
      "15": "From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "16": "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,",

      "16": "At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.",
      "17": "But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.",
