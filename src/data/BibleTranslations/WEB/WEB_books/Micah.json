      "1": "Yahweh’s word that came to Micah of Morasheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, you peoples, all of you!\n    Listen, O earth, and all that is therein.\nLet the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,\n    the Lord from his holy temple.",
      "3": "For behold, Yahweh comes out of his place,\n    and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains melt under him,\n    and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire,\n    like waters that are poured down a steep place.",
      "5": "“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,\n    and for the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the disobedience of Jacob?\n    Isn’t it Samaria?\nAnd what are the high places of Judah?\n    Aren’t they Jerusalem?",
      "6": "Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,\n    like places for planting vineyards;\nand I will pour down its stones into the valley,\n    and I will uncover its foundations.",
      "7": "All her idols will be beaten to pieces,\n    all her temple gifts will be burned with fire,\n    and I will destroy all her images;\nfor of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,\n    and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”",
      "8": "For this I will lament and wail.\n    I will go stripped and naked.\n    I will howl like the jackals\n    and mourn like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wounds are incurable;\n    for it has come even to Judah.\nIt reaches to the gate of my people,\n    even to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Don’t tell it in Gath.\n    Don’t weep at all.\n    At Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust.",
      "11": "Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.\n    The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out.\n    The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.",
      "12": "For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,\n    because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.\n    She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;\n    for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.\n    The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will yet bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah.\n    The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave your heads,\n    and cut off your hair for the children of your delight.\nEnlarge your baldness like the vulture,\n    for they have gone into captivity from you!"

      "3": "Therefore Yahweh says:\n“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,\n    from which you will not remove your necks,\n    neither will you walk haughtily,\n    for it is an evil time.",
      "4": "In that day they will take up a parable against you,\n    and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,\n    ‘We are utterly ruined!\n    My people’s possession is divided up.\n    Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”",
      "5": "Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly.",
      "6": "“Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—\n    “Don’t prophesy about these things.\n    Disgrace won’t overtake us.”",
      "7": "Shall it be said, O house of Jacob,\n    “Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry?\n    Are these his doings?\n    Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”",
      "8": "But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.\n    You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.",
      "9": "You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;\n    from their young children you take away my blessing forever.",
      "10": "Arise, and depart!\n    For this is not your resting place,\n    because of uncleanness that destroys,\n    even with a grievous destruction.",
      "11": "If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying,\n    “I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,”\n    he would be the prophet of this people.",
      "12": "I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.\n    I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.\nI will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,\n    as a flock in the middle of their pasture.\n    They will swarm with people.",
      "13": "He who breaks open the way goes up before them.\n    They break through the gate, and go out.\n    Their king passes on before them,\n    with Yahweh at their head."

      "4": "Then they will cry to Yahweh,\n    but he will not answer them.\nYes, he will hide his face from them at that time,\n    because they made their deeds evil.”",
      "5": "Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:",
      "6": "“Therefore night is over you, with no vision,\n    and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;\n    and the sun will go down on the prophets,\n    and the day will be black over them.",
      "7": "The seers shall be disappointed,\n    and the diviners confounded.\nYes, they shall all cover their lips,\n    for there is no answer from God.”",
      "8": "But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit,\n    and of judgment, and of might,\n    to declare to Jacob his disobedience,\n    and to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,\n    and rulers of the house of Israel,\n    who abhor justice,\n    and pervert all equity,",
      "10": "who build up Zion with blood,\n    and Jerusalem with iniquity.",
      "11": "Her leaders judge for bribes,\n    and her priests teach for a price,\n    and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money;\nyet they lean on Yahweh, and say,\n    “Isn’t Yahweh among us?\n    No disaster will come on us.”",
      "12": "Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,\n    and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,\n    and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest."

      "1": "But in the latter days,\n    it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,\n    and it will be exalted above the hills;\n    and peoples will stream to it.",
      "2": "Many nations will go and say,\n    “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,\n    and to the house of the God of Jacob;\n    and he will teach us of his ways,\n    and we will walk in his paths.”\nFor the law will go out of Zion,\n    and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;",

      "4": "But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\n    No one will make them afraid,\nfor the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.",
      "5": "Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods,\n    but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.",
      "6": "“In that day,” says Yahweh,\n    “I will assemble that which is lame,\n    and I will gather that which is driven away,\n    and that which I have afflicted;",
      "7": "and I will make that which was lame a remnant,\n    and that which was cast far off a strong nation:\n    and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”",

      "9": "Now why do you cry out aloud?\n    Is there no king in you?\n    Has your counselor perished,\n    that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?",
      "10": "Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,\n    like a woman in travail;\n    for now you will go out of the city,\n    and will dwell in the field,\n    and will come even to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued.\n    There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.",

      "12": "But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,\n    neither do they understand his counsel;\n    for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.",
      "13": "Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,\n    for I will make your horn iron,\n    and I will make your hoofs bronze.\nYou will beat in pieces many peoples.\nI will devote their gain to Yahweh,\n    and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth."
