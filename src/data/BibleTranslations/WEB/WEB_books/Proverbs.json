      "11": "If they say, “Come with us.\n    Let’s lie in wait for blood.\n    Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.",
      "12": "Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,\n    and whole, like those who go down into the pit.",
      "13": "We’ll find all valuable wealth.\n    We’ll fill our houses with plunder.",

      "22": "“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?\n    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,\n    and fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "Turn at my reproof.\n    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.\n    I will make known my words to you.",

      "19": "None who go to her return again,\n    neither do they attain to the paths of life.",
      "20": "Therefore walk in the way of good men,\n    and keep the paths of the righteous.",
