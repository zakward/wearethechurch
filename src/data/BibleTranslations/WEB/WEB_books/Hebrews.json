      "6": "When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”",

      "11": "Let’s therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.",
      "12": "For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.",
      "13": "There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.",
      "14": "Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let’s hold tightly to our confession.",

      "13": "For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.",

      "11": "We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,",
      "12": "that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises.",

      "14": "saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”",
