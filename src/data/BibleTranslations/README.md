<p>Here you can find all of The Holy Bible translations that are availabe at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com">Bible Gateway</a>, in JSON and SQL format.
Text is downloaded with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/daniel-tran/meaningless">meaningless</a> package. All files were generated with the <code>bible_gateway.py</code> script and feel free to create any issues or pull requests as needed.
I will add more versions as they are supported by the <a href="https://github.com/daniel-tran/meaningless">meaningless</a> package.</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \* Both the **NMB** and **RVA** translations are not generated by the script since complete versions of them are not available on [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com) yet. The [meaningless](https://github.com/daniel-tran/meaningless) package still works for those translations, just not the entire Bible.

If you would like more resources, I have found that the 
[Holy-Bible-XML-Format](https://github.com/Beblia/Holy-Bible-XML-Format) is a great repo if you are willing to use XML.
