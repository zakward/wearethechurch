      "48": "And also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.’”",
      "49": "And all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up and went every man his way.",
      "50": "And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "And it was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah feareth King Solomon; for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.’”",
