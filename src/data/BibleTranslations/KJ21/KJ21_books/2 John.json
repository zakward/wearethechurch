      "1": "The Elder, Unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those who have known the truth,",
      "2": "for the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever:",
      "3": "Grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.",
      "4": "I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.",
      "5": "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning: that we love one another.",
      "6": "And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.",
      "7": "For many deceivers have entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.",
      "8": "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we may receive a full reward.",
      "9": "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ hath both the Father and the Son.",
      "10": "If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him Godspeed;",
      "11": "for he that biddeth him Godspeed is a partaker of his evil deeds.",
      "12": "Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.",
      "13": "The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen."
