      "4": "John baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.",
      "5": "And there went out unto him all the land of Judea and those of Jerusalem; and they were all baptized by him in the River Jordan, confessing their sins.",
      "6": "And John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "And he preached, saying, “There cometh after me One mightier than I, the strap of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.",
      "8": "I indeed have baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”",
      "9": "And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "And straightway coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.",
      "11": "And there came a voice from Heaven, saying, “Thou Art My Beloved Son, In Whom I Am Well Pleased.”",
      "12": "And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.",
      "13": "And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him.",
      "14": "Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God",
      "15": "and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand. Repent ye and believe the Gospel.”",
      "16": "Now as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.",
      "17": "And Jesus said unto them, “Come ye after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.”",
      "18": "And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed Him.",
      "19": "And when He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.",
      "20": "And straightway He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him.",
      "21": "And they went into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.",
      "22": "And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.",
      "23": "And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,",
      "24": "saying, “Let us alone. What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth? Hast Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee and who Thou art — the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Hold thy peace, and come out of him!”",
      "26": "And when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him.",
      "27": "And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”",
      "28": "And immediately His fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.",
      "29": "And forthwith when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.",
      "30": "But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and at once they told Him of her.",
      "31": "And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.",
      "32": "And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought unto Him all who were diseased and those who were possessed with devils.",
      "33": "And all the city was gathered together at the door.",
      "34": "And He healed many who were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and He suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew Him.",
      "35": "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.",
      "36": "And Simon and those who were with Him followed after Him.",
      "37": "And when they had found Him, they said unto Him, “All men seek for Thee.”",
      "38": "And He said unto them, “Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for therefore came I forth.”",
      "39": "And He preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.",
      "40": "And there came a leper to Him, beseeching Him and kneeling down to Him and saying unto Him, “If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.”",
      "41": "And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth His hand and touched him, and said unto him, “I will; be thou clean.”",
      "42": "And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.",
      "43": "And He strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away,",
      "44": "saying unto him, “See that thou say nothing to any man; but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony unto them.”",
      "45": "But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, and was outside in desert places. And they came to Him from every quarter."

      "3": "And they came unto Him, bringing one sick with the palsy, who was borne by four.",
      "4": "And when they could not come nigh unto Him because of the throng, they uncovered the roof where He was. And when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the one sick with the palsy lay.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the one sick with the palsy, “Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.”",
      "6": "But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,",
      "7": "“Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?”",
      "8": "And immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, He said unto them, “Why reason ye these things in your hearts:",
      "9": "whether it is easier to say to the sick with the palsy, ‘Thy sins are forgiven thee,’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up thy bed and walk’?",
      "10": "But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins—” He said to the one sick with the palsy,",
      "11": "“I say unto thee, arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.”",
      "12": "And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all, insomuch that they all were amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw it in this fashion!”",
      "13": "And He went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted unto Him, and He taught them.",
      "14": "And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the custom booth, and said unto him, “Follow Me.” And he arose and followed Him.",
      "15": "And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat at Levi’s house, that many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.",
      "16": "And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with publicans and sinners, they said unto His disciples, “How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard it, He said unto them, “They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”",
      "18": "And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast; and they came and said unto Him, “Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?”",
      "19": "And Jesus said unto them, “Can the attendants of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.",
      "21": "“No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment, else the new piece that filled it up teareth away from the old, and the rent is made worse.",
      "22": "And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins, else the new wine doth burst the skins, and the wine is spilled and the skins will be marred. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.”",
      "23": "And it came to pass that He went through the cornfields on the Sabbath day; and His disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.",
      "24": "And the Pharisees said unto Him, “Behold, why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?”",
      "25": "And He said unto them, “Have ye never read what David did when he was in need and hungered, he and they that were with him?",
      "26": "How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave it also to those who were with him?”",
      "27": "And He said unto them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "Therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”"

      "3": "And He said unto the man who had the withered hand, “Stand forth.”",
      "4": "And He said unto them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill?” But they held their peace.",
      "5": "And when He had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said unto the man, “Stretch forth thine hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored whole as the other.",
      "6": "And the Pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.",
      "7": "But Jesus withdrew Himself with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea,",

      "9": "And He spoke to His disciples that a small boat should await Him because of the multitude, lest they should throng Him.",
      "10": "For He had healed many, insomuch that they pressed upon Him to touch Him, as many as had plagues.",
      "11": "And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried, saying, “Thou art the Son of God!”",
      "12": "And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known.",
      "13": "And He went up onto a mountain, and called unto Him whom He would have, and they came unto Him.",
