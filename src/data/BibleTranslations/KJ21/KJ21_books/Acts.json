      "7": "And He said unto them, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.",
      "8": "But ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.”",

      "33": "Therefore, being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.",
