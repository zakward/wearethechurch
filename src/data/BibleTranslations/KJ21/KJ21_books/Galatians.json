      "1": "Paul, an apostle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),",
      "2": "and all the brethren who are with me, Unto the churches of Galatia:",
      "3": "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,",
      "4": "who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father,",
      "5": "to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.",
      "6": "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him, that called you into the grace of Christ, for another gospel.",
      "7": "For this is not another; but there are some who trouble you and would pervert the Gospel of Christ.",
      "8": "But should we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.",
      "9": "As we said before, so say I now again: If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed!",
      "10": "For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I yet sought to please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.",
      "11": "But I certify to you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached by me is not according to man;",
      "12": "for I neither received it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
      "13": "For ye have heard of my participation in times past in the Jews’ religion, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and wasted it.",
      "14": "I profited in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.",
      "15": "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace,",
      "16": "to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen, I conferred not immediately with flesh and blood,",
      "17": "nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus.",
      "18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.",
      "19": "But I saw none of the other apostles save James, the Lord’s brother.",
      "20": "(Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.)",
      "21": "Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,",
      "22": "and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ;",
      "23": "but they had heard only that, “He who persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.”",
      "24": "And they glorified God in me."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Then fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.",
      "2": "And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.",
      "3": "But neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;",
      "4": "and that because false brethren were brought in by stealth, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.",
      "5": "To them we gave place by submission not even for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you.",
      "6": "But of those who seemed to be something (whosoever they were, it maketh no difference to me: God accepteth no man’s person) — those who seemed to be somewhat in consultation added nothing to me;",
      "7": "but contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel to the Uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the Gospel to the Circumcision was unto Peter",
      "8": "(for He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the Circumcision, that Same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles),",
      "9": "and when James, Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the Circumcision.",
      "10": "Only they would that we should remember the poor, the same as I also was eager to do.",
      "11": "But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed.",
      "12": "For before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself from them, fearing those who were of the Circumcision.",
      "13": "And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, so much that Barnabas also was carried away by their dissimulation.",
      "14": "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, “If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",
      "15": "We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",
      "16": "knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
      "17": "But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin? God forbid!",
      "18": "For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.",
      "19": "For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.",
      "20": "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.",
      "21": "I do not frustrate the grace of God; for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "O foolish Galatians! Who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been clearly set forth, crucified among you?",
      "2": "This only would I learn of you: Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",
      "3": "Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?",
      "4": "Have ye suffered so many things in vain — if it be yet in vain?",
      "5": "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you, doeth He it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",
      "6": "Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”",
      "7": "Know ye therefore that those who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.",
      "8": "And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached beforehand the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, “In thee shall all nations be blessed.”",
      "9": "So then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.",
      "10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written: “Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.”",
      "11": "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.”",
      "12": "And the law is not of faith, but “The man who doeth them shall live in them.”",
      "13": "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is every one who hangeth on a tree”),",
      "14": "that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
      "15": "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: A covenant, though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man annulleth or addeth thereto.",
      "16": "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, “and to seeds,” as though many; but as though one: “and to thy Seed,” who is Christ.",
      "17": "And this I say, that the Covenant which was confirmed earlier by God in Christ cannot be annulled by the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, so as to make the promise of no effect.",
      "18": "For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.",
      "19": "For what then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and itwas ordained by angels through the hand of a mediator.",
      "20": "Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.",
      "21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should then have come by the law.",
      "22": "But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.",
      "23": "But before faith came, we were kept under the law, being shut apart from the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",
      "24": "Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
      "25": "But after faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.",
      "26": "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.",
      "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.",
      "28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.",
      "29": "And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth in nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all.",
      "2": "But he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.",
      "3": "Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.",
      "4": "But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law,",
      "5": "to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",
      "6": "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father.”",
      "7": "Therefore thou art no more a servant but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.",
      "8": "However that be, then when ye knew not God, ye did service unto those which by nature are not gods.",
      "9": "But now after ye have known God, or rather are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements unto which ye desire again to be in bondage?",
      "10": "Ye observe days and months and times and years.",
      "11": "I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.",
      "12": "Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye have not injured me at all.",
      "13": "Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the Gospel unto you at the first.",
      "14": "And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected, but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "Where is then the blessedness ye spoke of? For I bear you record that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me.",
      "16": "Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?",
      "17": "They zealously seek after you, but for no good; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might seek after them.",
      "18": "But it is good to be zealously sought after, always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.",
      "19": "My little children, over whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,",
      "20": "I desire to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I stand in doubt of you.",
      "21": "Tell me, ye who desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?",
      "22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.",
      "23": "But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, but he of the freewoman was by promise.",
      "24": "These things are an allegory, for these are the two covenants: The one is from Mount Sinai, which engendereth bondage; this is Hagar.",
      "25": "For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem as it is now, and is in bondage with her children.",
      "26": "But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and is the mother of us all.",
      "27": "For it is written: “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband.”",
      "28": "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.",
      "29": "But as then, he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.",
      "30": "Nevertheless what saith the Scripture? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.”",
      "31": "So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.",
      "2": "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",
      "3": "For I testify again to every man who is circumcised, that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.",
      "4": "Christ then becomes of no effect unto you, whosoever of you claim justification by the law; ye are fallen from grace.",
      "5": "For we, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.",
      "6": "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.",
      "7": "Ye were running well; who hindered you, that ye should not obey the truth?",
      "8": "This persuasion cometh not from Him that calleth you.",
      "9": "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.",
      "10": "I have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will be not otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.",
      "11": "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why then do I yet suffer persecution? Then would the offense of the cross cease.",
      "12": "I would that they were even cut off which trouble you!",
      "13": "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion of the flesh, but by love serve one another.",
      "14": "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”",
      "15": "But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye not be consumed one by another.",
      "16": "This I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.",
      "17": "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.",
      "18": "But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.",
      "19": "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",
      "20": "idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, quarreling, rivalry, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,",
      "21": "envying, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like. About these things I tell you again, as I have also told you in times past, that those who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.",
      "22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,",
      "23": "meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.",
      "24": "And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.",
      "25": "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.",
      "26": "Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another and envying one another."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",
      "2": "Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.",
      "3": "For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.",
      "4": "But let every man put to the proof his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.",
      "5": "For every man shall bear his own burden.",
      "6": "Let him that is taught in the Word share with him that teacheth, in all good things.",
      "7": "Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.",
      "8": "For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.",
      "9": "And let us not be weary in welldoing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.",
      "10": "As we therefore have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto those who are of the household of faith.",
      "11": "Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.",
      "12": "As many as desire to make a fair showing in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.",
      "13": "For not even they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",
      "14": "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.",
      "15": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",
      "16": "And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",
      "17": "From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.",
      "18": "Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
