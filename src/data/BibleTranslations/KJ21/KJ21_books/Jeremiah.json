      "2": "to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.",
      "3": "It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.",
      "4": "Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,",
      "5": "“Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.”",
      "6": "Then said I, “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child.”",
      "7": "But the Lord said unto me, “Say not, ‘I am a child,’ for thou shalt go to all whom I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.",
      "8": "Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee,” saith the Lord.",
      "9": "Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, “Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth.",
      "10": "See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down, and to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant.”",
      "11": "Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, “Jeremiah, what seest thou?” And I said, “I see a rod of an almond tree.”",
      "12": "Then said the Lord unto me, “Thou hast well seen, for I will hasten My word to perform it.”",
      "13": "And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, “What seest thou?” And I said, “I see a seething pot, and the face thereof is toward the north.”",
      "14": "Then the Lord said unto me, “Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.",
      "15": "For lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” saith the Lord; “and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.",
      "16": "And I will utter My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken Me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.",
      "17": "Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee. Be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.",
      "18": "For behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land — against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.",

      "14": "“Is Israel a servant? Is he a homeborn slave? Why is he despoiled?",
      "15": "The young lions roared at him and yelled, and they made his land waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.",

      "27": "saying to a stock, ‘Thou art my father,’ and to a stone, ‘Thou hast brought me forth.’ For they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’",
      "28": "But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.",
      "29": "“Why will ye plead with Me? Ye all have transgressed against Me,” saith the Lord.",
      "30": "“In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.",
      "31": "O generation, see ye the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? A land of darkness? Why say My people, ‘We are lords; we will come no more unto Thee’?",
      "32": "Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.",
      "33": "Why readiest thou thy way to seek love? Therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.",
      "34": "Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.",
      "35": "Yet thou sayest, ‘Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me.’ Behold, I will plead with thee because thou sayest, ‘I have not sinned.’",
      "36": "Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? Thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.",
