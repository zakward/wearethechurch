      "2": "To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.",
      "3": "I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that I have thee in remembrance in my prayers night and day without ceasing.",
      "4": "I greatly desire to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy",
      "5": "when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice and,I am persuaded, is in thee also.",
      "6": "Therefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the putting on of my hands.",
      "7": "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.",
      "8": "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God,",
      "9": "who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but in accordance with His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began,",
      "10": "but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.",
      "11": "For this I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles,",
      "12": "for which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that Day.",
      "13": "Hold fast to the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us.",
      "15": "This thou knowest, that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.",
      "16": "The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;",
      "17": "but when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.",
      "18": "The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day! And in how many things he ministered unto me in Ephesus,thou knowest very well."

      "9": "wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds. But the Word of God is not bound.",
      "10": "Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.",
      "11": "It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him;",
      "12": "if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us;",
      "13": "if we believe not, yet He abideth faithful; He cannot deny Himself.",
      "14": "Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers.",
      "15": "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman who needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.",
      "16": "But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness,",
      "17": "and their word will eat as doth a canker — among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,",
      "18": "who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrowing the faith of some.",
      "19": "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal: “The Lord knoweth those who are His,” and, “Let every one who nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”",
      "20": "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor and some to dishonor.",
      "21": "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and meet for the Master’s use, and prepared for every good work.",
      "22": "Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.",
      "23": "But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they engender strifes.",
      "24": "And the servant of the Lord must not engender strife, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,",
      "25": "in meekness instructing those in opposition. Perhaps God will give them repentance, that they may acknowledge the truth,",
      "26": "and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."

      "3": "without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, without selfcontrol, fierce, despisers of those who are good,",
      "4": "traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,",
      "5": "having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. From such turn away.",
      "6": "For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,",
      "7": "ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
      "8": "Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth — men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.",
      "9": "But they shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.",
      "10": "But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,",
      "11": "persecutions, afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra — what persecutions I endured. But out of them all, the Lord delivered me.",
      "12": "Yea, and all who will live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.",
      "13": "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.",
      "14": "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them,",
      "15": "and that from childhood thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "16": "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,",

      "3": "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but having itching ears, they shall heap to themselves teachers in accordance with their own lusts.",
      "4": "And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned toward fables.",
      "5": "But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry.",

      "7": "I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith.",
      "8": "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me on that Day — and not to me only, but unto all those also who love His appearing.",
      "9": "Use diligence to come shortly unto me,",
      "10": "for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.",

      "15": "Beware thou also of him, for he hath greatly withstood our words.",
      "16": "At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.",
      "17": "Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.",
