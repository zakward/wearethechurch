      "4": "In Him was life, and that life was the Light of men.",
      "5": "And the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",

      "8": "He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.",
      "9": "That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.",
      "11": "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.",
      "12": "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to those who believe in His name,",
      "13": "who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only Begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John bore witness of Him and cried, saying, “This was He of whom I spoke, ‘He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’”",
      "16": "And of His fullness have we all received, and grace for grace.",
      "17": "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.",
      "19": "And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who art thou?”",
      "20": "And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”",
      "21": "And they asked him, “What then? Art thou Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Art thou that Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”",
      "22": "Then said they unto him, “Who art thou, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?”",
      "23": "He said, “I am ‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of the Lord,”’ as said the prophet Isaiah.”",
      "24": "And those who were sent were of the Pharisees.",
      "25": "And they asked him, and said unto him, “Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water, but there standeth One among you whom ye know not.",
      "27": "He it is who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoe’s strap I am not worthy to unloose.”",
      "28": "These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is He of whom I said, ‘After me cometh a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.’",
      "31": "And I knew Him not; but that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore have I come baptizing with water.”",
      "32": "And John bore record, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and It abode upon Him.",
      "33": "And I knew Him not. But He that sent me to baptize with water, the Same said unto me, ‘Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the Same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.’",
      "34": "And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "Again the next day John stood with two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, “Behold the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and said unto them, “What seek ye?” They said unto Him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, “Master”), “where dwellest Thou?”",
      "39": "He said unto them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where He dwelt and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.",
      "41": "He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is, being interpreted, “the Christ”).",
      "42": "And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, He said, “Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah. Thou shalt be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, “a stone”).",
      "43": "The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and found Philip and said unto him, “Follow Me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”",
      "46": "And Nathanael said unto him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said unto him, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!”",
      "48": "Nathanael said unto Him, “How knowest Thou me?” Jesus answered and said unto him, “Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered and said unto Him, “Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel.”",
      "50": "Jesus answered and said unto him, “Because I said unto thee, ‘I saw thee under the fig tree,’ believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.”",
      "51": "And He said unto him, “Verily, verily I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"

      "5": "His mother said unto the servants, “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.”",
      "6": "And there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece.",
      "7": "Jesus said unto them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "And He said unto them, “Draw some out now, and bear it unto the governor of the feast.” And they took it.",
      "9": "When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, not knowing from whence it had come (but the servants who drew the water knew), the governor of the feast called the bridegroom",
      "10": "and said unto him, “Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and when men have drunk well, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.”",
      "11": "This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.",
      "12": "After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brethren and His disciples; and they continued there a few days.",
      "13": "And the Jews’ Passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem",
      "14": "and found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and also the changers of money, sitting there.",
      "15": "And when He had made a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overthrew the tables.",
      "16": "And He said unto those who sold doves, “Take these things hence! Make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise!”",
      "17": "And His disciples remembered that it was written: “The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up.”",
      "18": "Then the Jews answered and said unto Him, “What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered and said unto them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”",
      "20": "Then said the Jews, “Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But He spoke of the temple of His body.",
      "22": "When therefore He was risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them. And they believed the Scripture and the Word which Jesus had said.",
      "23": "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover on the feast day, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did.",
      "24": "But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them, because He knew all men,",
      "25": "and needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in man."

      "3": "Jesus answered and said unto him, “Verily, verily I say unto thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said unto Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Verily, verily I say unto thee, unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.",
      "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Marvel not that I said unto thee, ‘Ye must be born again.’",

      "9": "Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, “How can these things be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said unto him, “Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?",
      "11": "Verily, verily I say unto thee, we speak what we know and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.",
      "12": "If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?",
      "13": "And no man hath ascended up to Heaven, but He that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man who is in Heaven.",
      "14": "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.",
      "17": "For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.",
      "18": "“He that believeth in Him is not condemned; but He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
      "19": "And this is the condemnation: that Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.",
      "21": "But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.”",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He tarried with them, and baptized.",
      "23": "And John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized,",
      "24": "for John had not yet been cast into prison.",
      "25": "Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.",
      "26": "And they came unto John and said unto him, “Rabbi, He that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou bearest witness — behold, the same baptizeth and all men come to Him.”",
      "27": "John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from Heaven.",
      "28": "Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but that ‘I am sent before Him.’",
      "29": "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.",

      "31": "“He that cometh from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth. He that cometh from Heaven is above all.",
      "32": "And what He hath seen and heard, to that He testifieth, and no man receiveth His testimony.",
      "33": "He that hath received His testimony hath set his seal to this: that God is true.",
      "34": "For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God, for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.",
      "35": "The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into His hand.",
