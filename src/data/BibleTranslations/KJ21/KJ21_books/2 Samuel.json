      "2": "it came even to pass on the third day that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth and did obeisance.",
      "3": "And David said unto him, “From whence comest thou?” And he said unto him, “Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.”",
      "4": "And David said unto him, “How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”",
      "5": "And David said unto the young man who told him, “How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”",
      "6": "And the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.",
      "7": "And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, ‘Here am I.’",
      "8": "And he said unto me, ‘Who art thou?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "And he said unto me again, ‘Stand, I pray thee, upon me and slay me; for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.’",
      "10": "So I stood upon him and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen. And I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.”",
      "11": "Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them, and likewise all the men who were with him.",
      "12": "And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.",
      "13": "And David said unto the young man who told him, “From whence art thou?” And he answered, “I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.”",

      "15": "And David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and fall upon him.” And he smote him so that he died.",
      "16": "And David said unto him, “Thy blood be upon thy head, for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, ‘I have slain the Lord’S anointed.’”",
      "17": "And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son",

      "20": "Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.",
      "21": "“Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings. For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.",
      "22": "“From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.",
      "23": "“Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.",
      "24": "“Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.",
      "25": "“How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou was slain in thine high places.",
      "26": "I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me. Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.",

      "16": "And they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side, so they fell down together; therefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim [that is, The field of strong men], which is in Gibeon.",
      "17": "And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.",
      "18": "And there were three sons of Zeruiah there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.",
      "19": "And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.",
      "20": "Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Art thou Asahel?” And he answered, “I am.”",
      "21": "And Abner said to him, “Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.",
      "22": "And Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn thee aside from following me. Why should I smite thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?”",
      "23": "However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the rear end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there and died in the same place. And it came to pass that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.",
      "24": "Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner. And the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the Wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour for ever? Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people to return from following their brethren?”",
      "27": "And Joab said, “As God liveth, unless thou had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every one from following his brother.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.",
      "29": "And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over the Jordan and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.",

      "13": "And he said, “Well; I will make a league with thee, but one thing I require of thee, that is: thou shalt not see my face, unless thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.”",
      "14": "And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”",
      "15": "And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.",
      "16": "And her husband went along with her, weeping behind her, to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, “Go, return.” And he returned.",
      "17": "And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you.",
      "18": "Now then do it; for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.’”",

      "21": "And Abner said unto David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.” And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",
      "22": "And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and all the host that was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”",
      "24": "Then Joab came to the king and said, “What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?",
      "25": "Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.”",
      "26": "And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.",

      "33": "And the king lamented over Abner and said, “Died Abner as a fool dieth?",
      "34": "Thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters. As a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou.” And all the people wept again over him.",
