      "2": "Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "3": "Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,",
      "4": "who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God.",
      "5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.",
      "6": "And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.",
      "7": "And our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.",
      "8": "For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were pressed beyond measure, beyond strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.",
      "9": "But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raiseth the dead,",
      "10": "who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver us, in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us.",
      "11": "Ye also helped by praying together for us, so that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.",
      "12": "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience: that we have had our discourse in the world, and more abundantly toward you, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God in simplicity and godly sincerity.",
      "13": "For we write no other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end,",
      "14": "as ye also have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the Day of the Lord Jesus.",
      "15": "And in this confidence, I was minded to come unto you before this, that ye might have a second benefit:",
      "16": "to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come again to you on my way out of Macedonia, and be sent by you on my way toward Judea.",
      "17": "When therefore I was thus minded, did I decide lightly? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be “yea, yea” and “nay, nay”?",
      "18": "But as God is true, our word toward you was not “yea” and “nay.”",
      "19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not “yea” and “nay,” but in Him was “yea.”",
      "20": "For all the promises of God in Him are “yea”; and in Him “amen” unto the glory of God by us.",
      "21": "Now He who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God,",
      "22": "who hath also put His seal upon us, and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.",
      "23": "Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that it was to spare you that I came not as yet unto Corinth,",

      "2": "For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then who maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?",
      "3": "And I wrote as I did unto you lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from those of whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.",
      "4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears, not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly for you.",
      "5": "But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part” that I may not overburden you all.",
      "6": "Sufficient to such a man is this censure, which was inflicted by many,",
      "7": "so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.",
      "8": "Therefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him.",
      "9": "For to this end also did I write, that I might have proof from you, whether ye be obedient in all things.",
      "10": "To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also; for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, I forgave it for your sakes in the person of Christ,",
      "11": "lest Satan should get an advantage over us. For we are not ignorant of his devices.",
      "12": "Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s Gospel, and a door was opened unto me by the Lord,",
      "13": "I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.",
      "14": "Now thanks be unto God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ and who maketh manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every place.",
      "15": "For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in those who are saved and in those who perish:",
      "16": "to the one we are the savor of death unto death, and to the other the savor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?",
      "17": "For we are not as many who corrupt the Word of God; but as out of sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."

      "3": "for ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but in fleshy tablets of the heart.",
      "4": "And such is the trust we have through Christ to Godward.",
      "5": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as coming from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,",
      "6": "who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament — not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.",
      "7": "But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away with,",
      "8": "how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?",
      "9": "For if the ministration of condemnation is glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory!",
      "10": "For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.",
      "11": "For if that which is done away with was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.",
      "12": "Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech—",
      "13": "and not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was being abolished.",
      "14": "But their minds were blinded; for until this day the same veil remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament, which veil is done away with in Christ.",
      "15": "But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their hearts.",
      "16": "Nevertheless, when they shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.",
      "17": "Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
      "18": "But we all, with uncovered face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."

      "3": "But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to those who are lost,",
      "4": "whose unbelieving minds the god of this world hath blinded, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.",
      "5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.",
      "6": "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.",
      "8": "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;",
      "9": "persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;",
      "10": "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.",
      "11": "For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.",
      "12": "So then death worketh in us, but life in you.",
      "13": "We, having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written: “I believed and therefore have I spoken” — we also believe and therefore speak,",
      "14": "knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.",
      "15": "For all things are for your sakes, that, through the thanksgiving of many, the abundant grace might redound to the glory of God.",
      "16": "For this cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.",
      "17": "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,",
      "18": "while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."

      "3": "that, being so clothed, we shall not be found naked.",
      "4": "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not because we would be unclothed, but clothed about, that mortality might be swallowed up by life.",
      "5": "Now He that hath wrought us for this selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the pledge of the Spirit.",
      "6": "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;",
      "7": "for we walk by faith, not by sight.",
      "8": "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.",
      "9": "Therefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted by Him.",
      "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.",
      "11": "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.",
      "12": "For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have something to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart.",
      "13": "For if we be beside ourselves, it is for God; if we be soberminded, it is for your cause.",
      "14": "For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge that if One died for all, then all were dead;",
      "15": "and that He died for all, that those who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them and rose again.",
      "16": "Therefore, henceforth know we no man according to the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth we know Him so no more.",
      "17": "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.",
      "18": "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation,",
      "19": "to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the Word of reconciliation.",
      "20": "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were beseeching you by us: we pray you on Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.",
      "21": "For He hath made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."

      "6": "by pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,",
      "7": "by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left;",
      "8": "through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report; though counted as deceivers and yet true,",

      "15": "And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?",
      "16": "And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God. As God hath said: “I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”",
      "17": "Therefore, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate,” saith the Lord. “And touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,",

      "7": "and not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me, so that I rejoiced the more.",

      "9": "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorrowful, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For ye were made sorrowful in a godly manner, that ye might receive injury from us in nothing.",
      "10": "For godly sorrow is not to be repented of, but worketh repentance unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.",
      "11": "For behold this selfsame thing, when ye sorrowed in a godly manner: what earnest concern it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what requital! In all these things ye have proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.",
      "12": "Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did not do so for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered wrong, but that our concern for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.",

      "8": "I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forthcoming of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.",

      "10": "And herein I give my advice, for this is expedient for you, who began earlier not only to do, but also to be in the forefront a year ago.",
      "11": "Now therefore perform the doing of it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.",
      "12": "For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.",
      "13": "For I do not mean that other men should be eased and ye burdened,",
      "14": "but that there be an equality: that now at this time your abundance may supply their want, that their abundance may also supply your want, that there may be equality.",
      "15": "As it is written: “He that had gathered much had nothing left over, and he that had gathered little had no lack.”",

      "18": "Since many glory in the flesh, I will glory also.)",
      "19": "For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise!",
      "20": "For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage, or if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.",
      "21": "I speak as reproached, as though we had been weak. However it be, whereinsoever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.",

      "25": "Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day adrift in the deep;",
      "26": "in journeyings often, in perils from waters, in perils from robbers, in perils from mine own countrymen, in perils from the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;",

      "29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?",
      "30": "If I must glory, I will glory in the things which concern mine infirmities.",
      "31": "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.",
      "32": "In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me;",

      "11": "I have become a fool in glorying. Ye have compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For in nothing am I inferior to the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.",
      "12": "Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.",
      "13": "For in what are ye inferior to other churches, unless it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!",
