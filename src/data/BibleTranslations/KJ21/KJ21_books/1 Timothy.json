      "3": "As I besought thee when I went into Macedonia to abide still at Ephesus, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,",
      "4": "neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which promote questions rather than godly edifying in the faith, so do!",
      "5": "Now the aim of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, with a good conscience and with faith unfeigned,",
      "6": "from which some have swerved and have turned aside unto vain jangling,",
      "7": "desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm.",
      "8": "But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully,",
      "9": "knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,",
      "10": "for whoremongers, for those who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine",

      "12": "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, that He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry—",
      "13": "I, who was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;",
      "14": "and the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love, which are in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance: that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.",
      "16": "Nonetheless, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering as a pattern for those who should hereafter believe in Him to life everlasting.",
      "17": "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.",

      "3": "For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,",

      "9": "In like manner also, that women should adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobermindedness, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array,",

      "11": "Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.",
      "12": "But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.",

      "7": "Moreover he must have a good reputation with those who are outsiders, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.",
      "8": "Likewise must the deacons be serious, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for filthy lucre,",
      "9": "holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.",
      "10": "And let these also first be proved; then, being found blameless, let them make use of the office of a deacon.",
      "11": "So also must their wives be serious, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.",
      "12": "Let each deacon be the husband of one wife, ruling his children and his own house well.",
      "13": "For those who have ministered the office of deacon well purchase for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith, which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "14": "These things I write unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly,",
      "15": "but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou ought to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.",
      "16": "And beyond controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."

      "3": "forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.",
      "4": "For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving;",
      "5": "for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.",
      "6": "If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of good doctrine unto which thou hast attained.",
      "7": "But reject profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.",
      "8": "For bodily exercise profiteth little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.",
      "9": "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.",
      "10": "For therefor we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.",
      "11": "These things command and teach.",

      "4": "But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before God.",
      "5": "Now she that is indeed a widow, and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.",
      "6": "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.",
      "7": "And these things charge them, that they may be blameless.",

      "12": "having damnation because they have cast off their first faith.",
      "13": "And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.",
      "14": "It is my will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.",
      "15": "For some have already turned aside after Satan.",
      "16": "If any man or woman who believeth have widows, let them relieve them and let not the church be burdened, that it may assist those who are widows indeed.",
      "17": "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the Word and doctrine.",
      "18": "For the Scripture saith, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his reward.”",
      "19": "Against an elder receive not an accusation, except before two or three witnesses.",
      "20": "Those who sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.",
      "21": "I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.",
      "22": "Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself pure.",
      "23": "Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent infirmities.",
      "24": "Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going on to judgment; and in some men they follow after.",

      "4": "he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes over words, from which cometh envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions,",
      "5": "perverse disputings by men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. From such withdraw thyself.",
      "6": "But godliness with contentment is great gain.",
      "7": "For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.",
      "8": "And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.",
      "9": "But those who would be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.",
      "10": "For the love of money is the root of all evil; and while some have coveted after it, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.",
