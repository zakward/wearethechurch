      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:",
      "2": "To know wisdom and instruction,\n    to understand words of insight,",
      "3": "to receive instruction in wise dealing,\n    in righteousness, justice, and equity;",
      "4": "to give prudence to the simple,\n    knowledge and discretion to the youth—",
      "5": "Let the wise hear and increase in learning,\n    and the one who understands obtain guidance,",
      "6": "to understand a proverb and a saying,\n    the words of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;\n    fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "Hear, my son, your father's instruction,\n    and forsake not your mother's teaching,",
      "9": "for they are a graceful garland for your head\n    and pendants for your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinners entice you,\n    do not consent.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood;\n    let us ambush the innocent without reason;",
      "12": "like Sheol let us swallow them alive,\n    and whole, like those who go down to the pit;",
      "13": "we shall find all precious goods,\n    we shall fill our houses with plunder;",
      "14": "throw in your lot among us;\n    we will all have one purse”—",
      "15": "my son, do not walk in the way with them;\n    hold back your foot from their paths,",
      "16": "for their feet run to evil,\n    and they make haste to shed blood.",
      "17": "For in vain is a net spread\n    in the sight of any bird,",
      "18": "but these men lie in wait for their own blood;\n    they set an ambush for their own lives.",
      "19": "Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain;\n    it takes away the life of its possessors.",
      "20": "Wisdom cries aloud in the street,\n    in the markets she raises her voice;",
      "21": "at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;\n    at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:",
      "22": "“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?\nHow long will scoffers delight in their scoffing\n    and fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "If you turn at my reproof,\nbehold, I will pour out my spirit to you;\n    I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I have called and you refused to listen,\n    have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,",
      "25": "because you have ignored all my counsel\n    and would have none of my reproof,",
      "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity;\n    I will mock when terror strikes you,",
      "27": "when terror strikes you like a storm\n    and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,\n    when distress and anguish come upon you.",
      "28": "Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;\n    they will seek me diligently but will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated knowledge\n    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
      "30": "would have none of my counsel\n    and despised all my reproof,",
      "31": "therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,\n    and have their fill of their own devices.",
      "32": "For the simple are killed by their turning away,\n    and the complacency of fools destroys them;",
      "33": "but whoever listens to me will dwell secure\n    and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.”"

      "4": "if you seek it like silver\n    and search for it as for hidden treasures,",
      "5": "then you will understand the fear of the Lord\n    and find the knowledge of God.",
      "6": "For the Lord gives wisdom;\n    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;",

      "12": "delivering you from the way of evil,\n    from men of perverted speech,",
      "13": "who forsake the paths of uprightness\n    to walk in the ways of darkness,",
      "14": "who rejoice in doing evil\n    and delight in the perverseness of evil,",
      "15": "men whose paths are crooked,\n    and who are devious in their ways.",
      "16": "So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman,\n    from the adulteress with her smooth words,",
      "17": "who forsakes the companion of her youth\n    and forgets the covenant of her God;",
      "18": "for her house sinks down to death,\n    and her paths to the departed;",
      "19": "none who go to her come back,\n    nor do they regain the paths of life.",
      "20": "So you will walk in the way of the good\n    and keep to the paths of the righteous.",
      "21": "For the upright will inhabit the land,\n    and those with integrity will remain in it,",
      "22": "but the wicked will be cut off from the land,\n    and the treacherous will be rooted out of it."

      "9": "Honor the Lord with your wealth\n    and with the firstfruits of all your produce;",
      "10": "then your barns will be filled with plenty,\n    and your vats will be bursting with wine.",
      "11": "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline\n    or be weary of his reproof,",
      "12": "for the Lord reproves him whom he loves,\n    as a father the son in whom he delights.",
      "13": "Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,\n    and the one who gets understanding,",
      "14": "for the gain from her is better than gain from silver\n    and her profit better than gold.",
      "15": "She is more precious than jewels,\n    and nothing you desire can compare with her.",
      "16": "Long life is in her right hand;\n    in her left hand are riches and honor.",
      "17": "Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\n    and all her paths are peace.",
      "18": "She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;\n    those who hold her fast are called blessed.",
      "19": "The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;\n    by understanding he established the heavens;",
      "20": "by his knowledge the deeps broke open,\n    and the clouds drop down the dew.",
      "21": "My son, do not lose sight of these—\n    keep sound wisdom and discretion,",
      "22": "and they will be life for your soul\n    and adornment for your neck.",
      "23": "Then you will walk on your way securely,\n    and your foot will not stumble.",
      "24": "If you lie down, you will not be afraid;\n    when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.",
      "25": "Do not be afraid of sudden terror\n    or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,",
      "26": "for the Lord will be your confidence\n    and will keep your foot from being caught.",
      "27": "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,\n    when it is in your power to do it.",
      "28": "Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,\n    tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.",
      "29": "Do not plan evil against your neighbor,\n    who dwells trustingly beside you.",
      "30": "Do not contend with a man for no reason,\n    when he has done you no harm.",
      "31": "Do not envy a man of violence\n    and do not choose any of his ways,",
      "32": "for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord,\n    but the upright are in his confidence.",
      "33": "The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked,\n    but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.",
      "34": "Toward the scorners he is scornful,\n    but to the humble he gives favor.",
