      "3": "David asked him, “Where have you come from?”\nHe replied to him, “I’ve escaped from the Israelite camp.”",
      "4": "“What was the outcome? Tell me,” David asked him.\n“The troops fled from the battle,” he answered. “Many of the troops have fallen and are dead. Also, Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”",
      "5": "David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear. At that very moment the chariots and the cavalry were closing in on him.",
      "7": "When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, so I answered: I’m at your service.",
      "8": "He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I told him: I’m an Amalekite.",
      "9": "Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for I’m mortally wounded, but my life still lingers.’",
      "10": "So I stood over him and killed him because I knew that after he had fallen he couldn’t survive. I took the crown that was on his head and the armband that was on his arm, and I’ve brought them here to my lord.”",
      "11": "Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and all the men with him did the same.",

      "15": "Then David summoned one of his servants and said, “Come here and kill him!” The servant struck him, and he died.",

      "14": "Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have the young men get up and compete in front of us.”\n“Let them get up,” Joab replied.",
      "15": "So they got up and were counted off—twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from David’s soldiers.",
      "16": "Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side so that they all died together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is named Field of Blades.",

      "23": "But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner hit him in the stomach with the butt of his spear. The spear went through his body, and he fell and died right there. As they all came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, they stopped,",
      "24": "but Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "The Benjaminites rallied to Abner; they formed a unit and took their stand on top of a hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?”",
      "27": "“As God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken up, the troops wouldn’t have stopped pursuing their brothers until morning.”",
      "28": "Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight.",
      "29": "So Abner and his men marched through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning, and arrived at Mahanaim.",

      "8": "Abner was very angry about Ish-bosheth’s accusation. “Am I a dog’s head who belongs to Judah?” he asked. “All this time I’ve been loyal to the family of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends and haven’t betrayed you to David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!",

      "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside to the middle of the city gate, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died in revenge for the death of Asahel, Joab’s brother.",

      "19": "The king asked, “Did Joab put you up to all this?”\nThe woman answered. “As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or left from all my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave orders to me; he told your servant exactly what to say.",
      "20": "Joab your servant has done this to address the issue indirectly, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, knowing everything on earth.”",

      "25": "No man in all Israel was as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.",
      "26": "When he shaved his head—he shaved it at the end of every year because his hair got so heavy for him that he had to shave it off—he would weigh the hair from his head and it would be five pounds according to the royal standard.",

      "32": "“Look,” Absalom explained to Joab, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? I’d be better off if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king. If I am guilty, let him kill me.”",

      "2": "The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?”\nZiba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who become exhausted in the wilderness.”",
      "3": "“Where is your master’s grandson?” the king asked.\n“Why, he’s staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied to the king, “for he said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore my grandfather’s kingdom to me.’”",

      "12": "Perhaps the Lord will see my affliction and restore goodness to me instead of Shimei’s curses today.”",
      "13": "So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei was going along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he cursed David, threw stones at him, and kicked up dust.",
