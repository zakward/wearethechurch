      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He was with God in the beginning.",
      "3": "All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.",
      "4": "In him was life, and that life was the light of men.",
      "5": "That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.",
      "8": "He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.",
      "9": "The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him.",
      "11": "He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.",
      "12": "But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name,",
      "13": "who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "(John testified concerning him and exclaimed, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’”)",
      "16": "Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness,",
      "17": "for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.",
      "19": "This was John’s testimony when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He didn’t deny it but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.”",
      "21": "“What then?” they asked him. “Are you Elijah?” \n“I am not,” he said.\n“Are you the Prophet?” \n“No,” he answered.",
      "22": "“Who are you, then?” they asked. “We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What can you tell us about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said, “I am a voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord—just as Isaiah the prophet said.”",
      "24": "Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "So they asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you aren’t the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”",
      "26": "“I baptize with water,” John answered them. “Someone stands among you, but you don’t know him.",
      "27": "He is the one coming after me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to untie.”",
      "28": "All this happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is the one I told you about: ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’",
      "31": "I didn’t know him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”",
      "32": "And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and he rested on him.",
      "33": "I didn’t know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The one you see the Spirit descending and resting on—he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "The next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.",
      "36": "When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus.",
      "38": "When Jesus turned and noticed them following him, he asked them, “What are you looking for?”\nThey said to him, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”",
      "39": "“Come and you’ll see,” he replied. So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four in the afternoon.",
      "40": "Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.",
      "41": "He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “the Christ”),",
      "42": "and he brought Simon to Jesus.\nWhen Jesus saw him, he said, “You are Simon, son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated “Peter”).",
      "43": "The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip and told him, “Follow me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law (and so did the prophets): Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”",
      "46": "“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Nathanael asked him.\n“Come and see,” Philip answered.",
      "47": "Then Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”",
      "48": "“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked.\n“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you,” Jesus answered.",
      "49": "“Rabbi,” Nathanael replied, “You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus responded to him, “Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this.”",
      "51": "Then he said, “Truly I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’s mother was there,",
      "2": "and Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding as well.",
      "3": "When the wine ran out, Jesus’s mother told him, “They don’t have any wine.”",
      "4": "“What has this concern of yours to do with me, woman?” Jesus asked. “My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "“Do whatever he tells you,” his mother told the servants.",
      "6": "Now six stone water jars had been set there for Jewish purification. Each contained twenty or thirty gallons.",
      "7": "“Fill the jars with water,” Jesus told them. So they filled them to the brim.",
      "8": "Then he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the headwaiter.” And they did.",
      "9": "When the headwaiter tasted the water (after it had become wine), he did not know where it came from—though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the groom",
      "10": "and told him, “Everyone sets out the fine wine first, then, after people are drunk, the inferior. But you have kept the fine wine until now.”",
      "11": "Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
      "12": "After this, he went down to Capernaum, together with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there only a few days.",
      "13": "The Jewish Passover was near, and so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "In the temple he found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and he also found the money changers sitting there.",
      "15": "After making a whip out of cords, he drove everyone out of the temple with their sheep and oxen. He also poured out the money changers’ coins and overturned the tables.",
      "16": "He told those who were selling doves, “Get these things out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a marketplace!”",
      "17": "And his disciples remembered that it is written: Zeal for your house will consume me.",
      "18": "So the Jews replied to him, “What sign will you show us for doing these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.”",
      "20": "Therefore the Jews said, “This temple took forty-six years to build, and will you raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But he was speaking about the temple of his body.",
      "22": "So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the statement Jesus had made.",
      "23": "While he was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many believed in his name when they saw the signs he was doing.",
      "24": "Jesus, however, would not entrust himself to them, since he knew them all",
      "25": "and because he did not need anyone to testify about man; for he himself knew what was in man."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
      "2": "This man came to him at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform these signs you do unless God were with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "“How can anyone be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again.",
      "8": "The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "“How can these things be?” asked Nicodemus.",
      "10": "“Are you a teacher of Israel and don’t know these things?” Jesus replied.",
      "11": "“Truly I tell you, we speak what we know and we testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony.",
      "12": "If I have told you about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven —the Son of Man.",
      "14": "“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,",
      "15": "so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.",
      "16": "For God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.",
      "18": "Anyone who believes in him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
      "19": "This is the judgment: The light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids it, so that his deeds may not be exposed.",
      "21": "But anyone who lives by the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God.”",
      "22": "After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent time with them and baptized.",
      "23": "John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People were coming and being baptized,",
      "24": "since John had not yet been thrown into prison.",
      "25": "Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a Jew about purification.",
      "26": "So they came to John and told him, “Rabbi, the one you testified about, and who was with you across the Jordan, is baptizing—and everyone is going to him.”",
      "27": "John responded, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but I’ve been sent ahead of him.’",
      "29": "He who has the bride is the groom. But the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the groom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.”",
      "31": "The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth is earthly and speaks in earthly terms. The one who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "He testifies to what he has seen and heard, and yet no one accepts his testimony.",
      "33": "The one who has accepted his testimony has affirmed that God is true.",
      "34": "For the one whom God sent speaks God’s words, since he gives the Spirit without measure.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hands.",
      "36": "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him."

      "3": "he left Judea and went again to Galilee.",
      "4": "He had to travel through Samaria;",
      "5": "so he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar near the property that Jacob had given his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, worn out from his journey, sat down at the well. It was about noon.",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water.\n“Give me a drink,” Jesus said to her,",
      "8": "because his disciples had gone into town to buy food.",
      "9": "“How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” she asked him. For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.",
      "10": "Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God, and who is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would ask him, and he would give you living water.”",
      "11": "“Sir,” said the woman, “you don’t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. So where do you get this ‘living water’?",
      "12": "You aren’t greater than our father Jacob, are you? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and livestock.”",
      "13": "Jesus said, “Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again.",
      "14": "But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again. In fact, the water I will give him will become a well of water springing up in him for eternal life.”",
      "15": "“Sir,” the woman said to him, “give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water.”",
      "16": "“Go call your husband,” he told her, “and come back here.”",
      "17": "“I don’t have a husband,” she answered.\n“You have correctly said, ‘I don’t have a husband,’” Jesus said.",
      "18": "“For you’ve had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”",
      "19": "“Sir,” the woman replied, “I see that you are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.”",
      "21": "Jesus told her, “Believe me, woman, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth. Yes, the Father wants such people to worship him.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and in truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”",
      "26": "Jesus told her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”",
      "27": "Just then his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”",
      "28": "Then the woman left her water jar, went into town, and told the people,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?”",
      "30": "They left the town and made their way to him.",

      "32": "But he said, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”",
      "33": "The disciples said to one another, “Could someone have brought him something to eat?”",
      "34": "“My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work,” Jesus told them.",
      "35": "“Don’t you say, ‘There are still four more months, and then comes the harvest’? Listen to what I’m telling you: Open your eyes and look at the fields, because they are ready for harvest.",
      "36": "The reaper is already receiving pay and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together.",
      "37": "For in this case the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap what you didn’t labor for; others have labored, and you have benefited from their labor.”",
      "39": "Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of what the woman said when she testified, “He told me everything I ever did.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more believed because of what he said.",

      "45": "When they entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen everything he did in Jerusalem during the festival. For they also had gone to the festival.",
      "46": "He went again to Cana of Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. There was a certain royal official whose son was ill at Capernaum.",
      "47": "When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him and pleaded with him to come down and heal his son, since he was about to die.",
      "48": "Jesus told him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”",
      "49": "“Sir,” the official said to him, “come down before my boy dies.”",
      "50": "“Go,” Jesus told him, “your son will live.” The man believed what Jesus said to him and departed.",
      "51": "While he was still going down, his servants met him saying that his boy was alive.",
      "52": "He asked them at what time he got better. “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him,” they answered.",
      "53": "The father realized this was the very hour at which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole household.",

      "7": "“Sir,” the disabled man answered, “I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, someone goes down ahead of me.”",

      "11": "He replied, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”",
      "12": "“Who is this man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?” they asked.",
      "13": "But the man who was healed did not know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.",

      "15": "The man went and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
      "16": "Therefore, the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "Jesus responded to them, “My Father is still working, and I am working also.”",
      "18": "This is why the Jews began trying all the more to kill him: Not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.",
      "19": "Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, the Son is not able to do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son likewise does these things.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing, and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be amazed.",
      "21": "And just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom he wants.",
      "22": "The Father, in fact, judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son,",

      "3": "“I’m going fishing,” Simon Peter said to them.\n“We’re coming with you,” they told him. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.",
      "4": "When daybreak came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.",
      "5": "“Friends,” Jesus called to them, “you don’t have any fish, do you?”\n“No,” they answered.",
      "6": "“Cast the net on the right side of the boat,” he told them, “and you’ll find some.” So they did, and they were unable to haul it in because of the large number of fish.",
      "7": "The disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” \nWhen Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tied his outer clothing around him (for he had taken it off) and plunged into the sea.",

      "10": "“Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught,” Jesus told them.",
      "11": "So Simon Peter climbed up and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish—153 of them. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.",
      "12": "“Come and have breakfast,” Jesus told them. None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.",
      "13": "Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish.",
      "14": "This was now the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.",
      "15": "When they had eaten breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”\n“Yes, Lord,” he said to him, “you know that I love you.”\n“Feed my lambs,” he told him.",
      "16": "A second time he asked him, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\n“Yes, Lord,” he said to him, “you know that I love you.”\n“Shepherd my sheep,” he told him.",
      "17": "He asked him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\nPeter was grieved that he asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.”\n“Feed my sheep,” Jesus said.",
      "18": "“Truly I tell you, when you were younger, you would tie your belt and walk wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will tie you and carry you where you don’t want to go.”",

      "21": "When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”",
      "22": "“If I want him to remain until I come,” Jesus answered, “what is that to you? As for you, follow me.”",
      "23": "So this rumor spread to the brothers and sisters that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not tell him that he would not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”",
      "24": "This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.",
      "25": "And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if every one of them were written down, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written."
