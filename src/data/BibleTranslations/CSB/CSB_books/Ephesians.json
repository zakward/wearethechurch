      "6": "to the praise of his glorious grace that he lavished on us in the Beloved One.",

      "13": "In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed.",
      "14": "The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.",
      "15": "This is why, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,",
      "16": "I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers.",
      "17": "I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.",

      "21": "far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given, not only in this age but also in the one to come.",
      "22": "And he subjected everything under his feet and appointed him as head over everything for the church,",

      "12": "At that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world.",
      "13": "But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.",
      "14": "For he is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In his flesh,",
      "15": "he made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that he might create in himself one new man from the two, resulting in peace.",
      "16": "He did this so that he might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross by which he put the hostility to death.",
      "17": "He came and proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.",

      "7": "I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of his power.",
      "8": "This grace was given to me—the least of all the saints—to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of Christ,",
      "9": "and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.",

      "10": "The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens, to fill all things.",

      "16": "From him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.",
      "17": "Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thoughts.",
      "18": "They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because of the hardness of their hearts.",

      "26": "Be angry and do not sin. Don’t let the sun go down on your anger,",
      "27": "and don’t give the devil an opportunity.",
      "28": "Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need.",
      "29": "No foul language should come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up someone in need, so that it gives grace to those who hear.",

      "25": "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her",
      "26": "to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word.",
      "27": "He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.",
      "28": "In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
      "29": "For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,",
      "30": "since we are members of his body.",
