      "3": "They searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel; they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "The girl was of unsurpassed beauty, and she became the king’s caregiver. She attended to him, but he was not intimate with her.",
      "5": "Adonijah son of Haggith kept exalting himself, saying, “I will be king!” He prepared chariots, cavalry, and fifty men to run ahead of him.",
      "6": "But his father had never once infuriated him by asking, “Why did you do that?” In addition, he was quite handsome and was born after Absalom.",
      "7": "He conspired with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar. They supported Adonijah,",
      "8": "but the priest Zadok, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the prophet Nathan, Shimei, Rei, and David’s royal guard did not side with Adonijah.",
      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, goats, cattle, and fattened cattle near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king,",
      "10": "but he did not invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the royal guard, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know it?",
      "12": "Now please come and let me advise you. Save your life and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go, approach King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your servant: Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne? So why has Adonijah become king?’",
      "14": "At that moment, while you are still there speaking with the king, I’ll come in after you and confirm your words.”",
      "15": "So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.",
      "16": "Bathsheba knelt low and paid homage to the king, and he asked, “What do you want?”",
      "17": "She replied, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God, ‘Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne.’",
      "18": "Now look, Adonijah has become king. And, my lord the king, you didn’t know it.",
      "19": "He has lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the king’s sons, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander of the army, but he did not invite your servant Solomon.",
      "20": "Now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.",
      "21": "Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be regarded as criminals.”",
      "22": "At that moment, while she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan arrived,",
      "23": "and it was announced to the king, “The prophet Nathan is here.” He came into the king’s presence and paid homage to him with his face to the ground.",
      "24": "“My lord the king,” Nathan said, “did you say, ‘Adonijah is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne’?",
      "25": "For today he went down and lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and the priest Abiathar. And look! They’re eating and drinking in his presence, and they’re saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "But he did not invite me—me, your servant—or the priest Zadok or Benaiah son of Jehoiada or your servant Solomon.",
      "27": "I’m certain my lord the king would not have let this happen without letting your servant know who will sit on my lord the king’s throne after him.”",
      "28": "King David responded by saying, “Call in Bathsheba for me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him.",
      "29": "The king swore an oath and said, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from every difficulty,",
      "30": "just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel: Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne in my place, that is exactly what I will do this very day.”",
      "31": "Bathsheba knelt low with her face to the ground, paying homage to the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”",
      "32": "King David then said, “Call in the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada for me.” So they came into the king’s presence.",
      "33": "The king said to them, “Take my servants with you, have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.",
      "34": "There, the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan are to anoint him as king over Israel. You are to blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "35": "You are to come up after him, and he is to come in and sit on my throne. He is the one who is to become king in my place; he is the one I have commanded to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”",
      "36": "“Amen,” Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied to the king. “May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, so affirm it.",
      "37": "Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”",
      "38": "Then the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down, had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and took him to Gihon.",
      "39": "The priest Zadok took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram’s horn, and all the people proclaimed, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "40": "All the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth split open from the sound.",
      "41": "Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard the noise as they finished eating. Joab heard the sound of the ram’s horn and said, “Why is the town in such an uproar?”",
      "42": "He was still speaking when Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest, suddenly arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are an important man, and you must be bringing good news.”",
      "43": "“Unfortunately not,” Jonathan answered him. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king.",
      "44": "And with Solomon, the king has sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have had him ride on the king’s mule.",
      "45": "The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king in Gihon. They have gone up from there rejoicing. The town has been in an uproar; that’s the noise you heard.",
      "46": "Solomon has even taken his seat on the royal throne.",
      "47": "“The king’s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more well known than your name, and may he make his throne greater than your throne.’ Then the king bowed in worship on his bed.",
      "48": "And the king went on to say this: ‘Blessed be the Lord God of Israel! Today he has provided one to sit on my throne, and I am a witness.’”",
      "49": "Then all of Adonijah’s guests got up trembling and went their separate ways.",
      "50": "Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "It was reported to Solomon, “Look, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first swear to me that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”",
      "52": "Then Solomon said, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, he dies.”",
      "53": "So King Solomon sent for him, and they took him down from the altar. He came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your home.”"

      "3": "and keep your obligation to the Lord your God to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes, commands, ordinances, and decrees. This is written in the law of Moses, so that you will have success in everything you do and wherever you turn,",
      "4": "and so that the Lord will fulfill his promise that he made to me: ‘If your sons take care to walk faithfully before me with all their heart and all their soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’",
      "5": "“You also know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s army, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He murdered them in a time of peace to avenge blood shed in war. He spilled that blood on his own waistband and on the sandals of his feet.",
      "6": "Act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head descend to Sheol in peace.",
      "7": "“Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table because they supported me when I fled from your brother Absalom.",
      "8": "“Keep an eye on Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim who is with you. He uttered malicious curses against me the day I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, and I swore to him by the Lord, ‘I will never kill you with the sword.’",
      "9": "So don’t let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man. You know how to deal with him to bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.”",
      "10": "Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David.",
      "11": "The length of time David reigned over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.",
      "12": "Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingship was firmly established.",
      "13": "Now Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She asked, “Do you come peacefully?”\n“Peacefully,” he replied,",
      "14": "and then asked, “May I talk with you?” \n“Go ahead,” she answered.",
      "15": "“You know the kingship was mine,” he said. “All Israel expected me to be king, but then the kingship was turned over to my brother, for the Lord gave it to him.",
      "16": "So now I have just one request of you; don’t turn me down.”\nShe said to him, “Go on.”",
      "17": "He replied, “Please speak to King Solomon since he won’t turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”",
      "18": "“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”",
      "19": "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, sat down on his throne, and had a throne placed for the king’s mother. So she sat down at his right hand.",
      "20": "Then she said, “I have just one small request of you. Don’t turn me down.”\n“Go ahead and ask, mother,” the king replied, “for I won’t turn you down.”",
      "21": "So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”",
      "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, “Why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my elder brother, you might as well ask the kingship for him, for the priest Abiathar, and for Joab son of Zeruiah.”",
      "23": "Then King Solomon took an oath by the Lord: “May God punish me and do so severely if Adonijah has not made this request at the cost of his life.",
      "24": "And now, as the Lord lives—the one who established me, seated me on the throne of my father David, and made me a dynasty as he promised—I swear Adonijah will be put to death today!”",
      "25": "Then King Solomon dispatched Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died.",
      "26": "The king said to the priest Abiathar, “Go to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death today, since you carried the ark of the Lord God in the presence of my father David and you suffered through all that my father suffered.”",
      "27": "So Solomon banished Abiathar from being the Lord’s priest, and it fulfilled the Lord’s prophecy he had spoken at Shiloh against Eli’s family.",
      "28": "The news reached Joab. Since he had supported Adonijah but not Absalom, Joab fled to the Lord’s tabernacle and took hold of the horns of the altar.",
      "29": "It was reported to King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the Lord’s tabernacle and is now beside the altar.”\nThen Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada and told him, “Go and strike him down!”",
      "30": "So Benaiah went to the tabernacle and said to Joab, “This is what the king says: ‘Come out!’” \nBut Joab said, “No, for I will die here.”\nSo Benaiah took a message back to the king, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”",
      "31": "The king said to him, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him in order to remove from me and from my father’s family the blood that Joab shed without just cause.",
      "32": "The Lord will bring back his own blood on his head because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he, without my father David’s knowledge. With his sword, Joab murdered Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army.",
      "33": "The responsibility for their deaths will come back to Joab and to his descendants forever, but for David, his descendants, his dynasty, and his throne, there will be peace from the Lord forever.”",
      "34": "Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and put him to death. He was buried at his house in the wilderness.",
      "35": "Then the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army, and he appointed the priest Zadok in Abiathar’s place.",
      "36": "Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but don’t leave there and go anywhere else.",
      "37": "On the day you do leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will certainly die. Your blood will be on your own head.”",
      "38": "Shimei said to the king, “The sentence is fair; your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.",
      "39": "But then, at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. Shimei was informed, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.”",
      "40": "So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath to search for his slaves. He went and brought them back from Gath.",
      "41": "It was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned.",
      "42": "So the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Didn’t I make you swear by the Lord and warn you, saying, ‘On the day you leave and go anywhere else, know for sure that you will certainly die’? And you said to me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will obey.’",
      "43": "So why have you not kept the Lord’s oath and the command that I gave you?”",
      "44": "The king also said, “You yourself know all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore, the Lord has brought back your evil on your head,",
      "45": "but King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain established before the Lord forever.”",

      "3": "Solomon loved the Lord by walking in the statutes of his father David, but he also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.",
      "4": "The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there because it was the most famous high place. He offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.",
      "5": "At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night. God said, “Ask. What should I give you?”",
      "6": "And Solomon replied, “You have shown great and faithful love to your servant, my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, righteousness, and integrity. You have continued this great and faithful love for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.",
      "7": "“Lord my God, you have now made your servant king in my father David’s place. Yet I am just a youth with no experience in leadership.",
      "8": "Your servant is among your people you have chosen, a people too many to be numbered or counted.",
      "9": "So give your servant a receptive heart to judge your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?”",
      "10": "Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had requested this.",
      "11": "So God said to him, “Because you have requested this and did not ask for long life or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies, but you asked discernment for yourself to administer justice,",
      "12": "I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again.",
      "13": "In addition, I will give you what you did not ask for: both riches and honor, so that no king will be your equal during your entire life.",
      "14": "If you walk in my ways and keep my statutes and commands just as your father David did, I will give you a long life.”",
      "15": "Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants.",

      "18": "On the third day after I gave birth, she also had a baby and we were alone. No one else was with us in the house; just the two of us were there.",

      "20": "She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was asleep. She laid him in her arms, and she put her dead son in my arms.",
      "21": "When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. That morning, when I looked closely at him I realized that he was not the son I gave birth to.”",
      "22": "“No,” the other woman said. “My son is the living one; your son is the dead one.”\nThe first woman said, “No, your son is the dead one; my son is the living one.” So they argued before the king.",
      "23": "The king replied, “This woman says, ‘This is my son who is alive, and your son is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead, and my son is alive.’”",
      "24": "The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought the sword to the king.",
      "25": "And the king said, “Cut the living boy in two and give half to one and half to the other.”",
      "26": "The woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she felt great compassion for her son. “My lord, give her the living baby,” she said, “but please don’t have him killed!”\nBut the other one said, “He will not be mine or yours. Cut him in two!”",
      "27": "The king responded, “Give the living baby to the first woman, and don’t kill him. She is his mother.”",

      "16": "They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the thirty-two kings who were helping him were getting drunk in their quarters.",
      "17": "The young men of the provincial leaders marched out first. Then Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, saying, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”",
      "18": "So he said, “If they have marched out in peace, take them alive, and if they have marched out for battle, take them alive.”",
      "19": "The young men of the provincial leaders and the army behind them marched out from the city,",
      "20": "and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-hadad of Aram escaped on a horse with the cavalry.",
      "21": "Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the cavalry and the chariots. He inflicted a severe slaughter on Aram.",
      "22": "The prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Go and strengthen yourself, then consider carefully what you should do, for in the spring the king of Aram will attack you.”",
      "23": "Now the king of Aram’s servants said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hill country. That’s why they were stronger than we were. Instead, we should fight with them on the plain; then we will certainly be stronger than they are.",
      "24": "Also do this: remove each king from his position and appoint captains in their place.",
      "25": "Raise another army for yourself like the army you lost—horse for horse, chariot for chariot—and let’s fight with them on the plain; and we will certainly be stronger than they are.” The king listened to them and did it.",
      "26": "In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek to battle Israel.",
      "27": "The Israelites mobilized, gathered supplies, and went to fight them. The Israelites camped in front of them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the landscape.",
      "28": "Then the man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because the Arameans have said, “The Lord is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” I will hand over all this whole huge army to you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”",
      "29": "They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle took place, and the Israelites struck down the Arameans—one hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.",
      "30": "The ones who remained fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell on those twenty-seven thousand remaining men.\nBen-hadad also fled and went into an inner room in the city.",
      "31": "His servants said to him, “Consider this: we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. So let’s put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and let’s go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.”",
      "32": "So they dressed with sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, went to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please spare my life.’”\nSo he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”",
      "33": "Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, so they quickly picked up on this and responded, “Yes, it is your brother Ben-hadad.”\nThen he said, “Go and bring him.”\nSo Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him come up into the chariot.",
      "34": "Then Ben-hadad said to him, “I restore to you the cities that my father took from your father, and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, like my father set up in Samaria.”\nAhab responded, “On the basis of this treaty, I release you.” So he made a treaty with him and released him.",
      "35": "One of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow prophet by the word of the Lord, “Strike me!” But the man refused to strike him.",
      "36": "He told him, “Because you did not listen to the Lord, mark my words: When you leave me, a lion will kill you.” When he left him, a lion attacked and killed him.",
      "37": "The prophet found another man and said to him, “Strike me!” So the man struck him, inflicting a wound.",
      "38": "Then the prophet went and waited for the king on the road. He disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.",
      "39": "As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant marched out into the middle of the battle. Suddenly, a man turned aside and brought someone to me and said, ‘Guard this man! If he is ever missing, it will be your life in place of his life, or you will weigh out seventy-five pounds of silver.’",
      "40": "But while your servant was busy here and there, he disappeared.”\nThe king of Israel said to him, “That will be your sentence; you yourself have decided it.”",
      "41": "He quickly removed the bandage from his eyes. The king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.",
      "42": "The prophet said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because you released from your hand the man I had set apart for destruction, it will be your life in place of his life and your people in place of his people.’”",
      "43": "The king of Israel left for home resentful and angry, and he entered Samaria."

      "1": "Some time passed after these events. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard; it was in Jezreel next to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.",
      "2": "So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard so I can have it for a vegetable garden, since it is right next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver.”",
      "3": "But Naboth said to Ahab, “As the Lord is my witness, I will never give my ancestors’ inheritance to you.”",
      "4": "So Ahab went to his palace resentful and angry because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had told him. He had said, “I will not give you my ancestors’ inheritance.” He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and didn’t eat any food.",
      "5": "Then his wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, “Why are you so upset that you refuse to eat?”",
      "6": "“Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,” he replied. “I told him, ‘Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you a vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I won’t give you my vineyard!’”",
      "7": "Then his wife Jezebel said to him, “Now, exercise your royal power over Israel. Get up, eat some food, and be happy. For I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”",
      "8": "So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.",
      "9": "In the letters, she wrote:\nProclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people.",
      "10": "Then seat two wicked men opposite him and have them testify against him, saying, “You have cursed God and the king!” Then take him out and stone him to death.",
      "11": "The men of his city, the elders and nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them, just as it was written in the letters she had sent them.",
      "12": "They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people.",
      "13": "The two wicked men came in and sat opposite him. Then the wicked men testified against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed God and the king!” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.",
      "14": "Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”",
      "15": "When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite who refused to give it to you for silver, since Naboth isn’t alive, but dead.”",
      "16": "When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.",
      "17": "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:",
      "18": "“Get up and go to meet King Ahab of Israel, who is in Samaria. He’s in Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.",
      "19": "Tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Have you murdered and also taken possession?’ Then tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: In the place where the dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, the dogs will also lick up your blood!’”",
      "20": "Ahab said to Elijah, “So, my enemy, you’ve found me, have you?” \nHe replied, “I have found you because you devoted yourself to do what is evil in the Lord’s sight.",
      "21": "This is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to bring disaster on you and will eradicate your descendants:\nI will wipe out all of Ahab’s males,\nboth slave and free, in Israel;",
      "22": "I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have angered me and caused Israel to sin.’",
      "23": "The Lord also speaks of Jezebel: ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the plot of land at Jezreel:",
      "24": "Anyone who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, the dogs will eat,\nand anyone who dies in the field, the birds will eat.’”",
      "25": "Still, there was no one like Ahab, who devoted himself to do what was evil in the Lord’s sight, because his wife Jezebel incited him.",
      "26": "He committed the most detestable acts by following idols as the Amorites had, whom the Lord had dispossessed before the Israelites.",
      "27": "When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth over his body, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth and walked around subdued.",
      "28": "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:",
      "29": "“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? I will not bring the disaster during his lifetime, because he has humbled himself before me. I will bring the disaster on his house during his son’s lifetime.”"

      "4": "So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight Ramoth-gilead?” \nJehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”",
      "5": "But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “First, please ask what the Lord’s will is.”",
      "6": "So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go against Ramoth-gilead for war or should I refrain?”\nThey replied, “March up, and the Lord will hand it over to the king.”",
      "7": "But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the Lord here anymore? Let’s ask him.”",
      "8": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”\n“The king shouldn’t say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.",
      "9": "So the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Hurry and get Micaiah son of Imlah!”",
      "10": "Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, clothed in royal attire, were each sitting on his own throne. They were on the threshing floor at the entrance to the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them.",
