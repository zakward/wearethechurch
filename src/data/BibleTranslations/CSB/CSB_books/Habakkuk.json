    "1": {
      "1": "The pronouncement that the prophet Habakkuk saw.",
      "2": "How long, Lord, must I call for help\nand you do not listen\nor cry out to you about violence\nand you do not save?",
      "3": "Why do you force me to look at injustice?\nWhy do you tolerate wrongdoing?\nOppression and violence are right in front of me.\nStrife is ongoing, and conflict escalates.",
      "4": "This is why the law is ineffective\nand justice never emerges.\nFor the wicked restrict the righteous;\ntherefore, justice comes out perverted.",
      "5": "Look at the nations and observe—\nbe utterly astounded!\nFor I am doing something in your days\nthat you will not believe\nwhen you hear about it.",
      "6": "Look! I am raising up the Chaldeans,\nthat bitter, impetuous nation\nthat marches across the earth’s open spaces\nto seize territories not its own.",
      "7": "They are fierce and terrifying;\ntheir views of justice and sovereignty\nstem from themselves.",
      "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards\nand more fierce than wolves of the night.\nTheir horsemen charge ahead;\ntheir horsemen come from distant lands.\nThey fly like eagles, swooping to devour.",
      "9": "All of them come to do violence;\ntheir faces are set in determination.\nThey gather prisoners like sand.",
      "10": "They mock kings,\nand rulers are a joke to them.\nThey laugh at every fortress\nand build siege ramps to capture it.",
      "11": "Then they sweep by like the wind\nand pass through.\nThey are guilty; their strength is their god.",
      "12": "Are you not from eternity, Lord my God?\nMy Holy One, you will not die.\nLord, you appointed them to execute judgment;\nmy Rock, you destined them to punish us.",
      "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil,\nand you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.\nSo why do you tolerate those who are treacherous?\nWhy are you silent\nwhile one who is wicked swallows up\none who is more righteous than himself?",
      "14": "You have made mankind\nlike the fish of the sea,\nlike marine creatures that have no ruler.",
      "15": "The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook,\ncatch them in their dragnet,\nand gather them in their fishing net;\nthat is why they are glad and rejoice.",
      "16": "That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet\nand burn incense to their fishing net,\nfor by these things their portion is rich\nand their food plentiful.",
      "17": "Will they therefore empty their net\nand continually slaughter nations without mercy?"
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "I will stand at my guard post\nand station myself on the lookout tower.\nI will watch to see what he will say to me\nand what I should reply about my complaint.",
      "2": "The Lord answered me:\nWrite down this vision;\nclearly inscribe it on tablets\nso one may easily read it.",
      "3": "For the vision is yet for the appointed time;\nit testifies about the end and will not lie.\nThough it delays, wait for it,\nsince it will certainly come and not be late.",
      "4": "Look, his ego is inflated;\nhe is without integrity.\nBut the righteous one will live by his faith.",
      "5": "Moreover, wine betrays;\nan arrogant man is never at rest.\nHe enlarges his appetite like Sheol,\nand like Death he is never satisfied.\nHe gathers all the nations to himself;\nhe collects all the peoples for himself.",
      "6": "Won’t all of these take up a taunt against him,\nwith mockery and riddles about him?\nThey will say,\n“Woe to him who amasses what is not his—\nhow much longer?—\nand loads himself with goods taken in pledge.”",
      "7": "Won’t your creditors suddenly arise,\nand those who disturb you wake up?\nThen you will become spoil for them.",
      "8": "Since you have plundered many nations,\nall the peoples who remain will plunder you—\nbecause of human bloodshed\nand violence against lands, cities,\nand all who live in them.",
      "9": "Woe to him who dishonestly makes\nwealth for his house\nto place his nest on high,\nto escape the grasp of disaster!",
      "10": "You have planned shame for your house\nby wiping out many peoples\nand sinning against your own self.",
      "11": "For the stones will cry out from the wall,\nand the rafters will answer them\nfrom the woodwork.",
      "12": "Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed\nand founds a town with injustice!",
      "13": "Is it not from the Lord of Armies\nthat the peoples labor only to fuel the fire\nand countries exhaust themselves for nothing?",
      "14": "For the earth will be filled\nwith the knowledge of the Lord’s glory,\nas the water covers the sea.",
      "15": "Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink,\npouring out your wrath\nand even making them drunk,\nin order to look at their nakedness!",
      "16": "You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory.\nYou also—drink,\nand expose your uncircumcision!\nThe cup in the Lord’s right hand\nwill come around to you,\nand utter disgrace will cover your glory.",
      "17": "For your violence against Lebanon\nwill overwhelm you;\nthe destruction of animals will terrify you\nbecause of your human bloodshed and violence\nagainst lands, cities, and all who live in them.",
      "18": "What use is a carved idol\nafter its craftsman carves it?\nIt is only a cast image, a teacher of lies.\nFor the one who crafts its shape trusts in it\nand makes worthless idols that cannot speak.",
      "19": "Woe to him who says to wood: Wake up!\nor to mute stone: Come alive!\nCan it teach?\nLook! It may be plated with gold and silver,\nyet there is no breath in it at all.",
      "20": "But the Lord is in his holy temple;\nlet the whole earth\nbe silent in his presence."

    "3": {
      "1": "A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk. According to Shigionoth.",
      "2": "Lord, I have heard the report about you;\nLord, I stand in awe of your deeds.\nRevive your work in these years;\nmake it known in these years.\nIn your wrath remember mercy!",
      "3": "God comes from Teman,\nthe Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah\nHis splendor covers the heavens,\nand the earth is full of his praise.",
      "4": "His brilliance is like light;\nrays are flashing from his hand.\nThis is where his power is hidden.",
      "5": "Plague goes before him,\nand pestilence follows in his steps.",
      "6": "He stands and shakes the earth;\nhe looks and startles the nations.\nThe age-old mountains break apart;\nthe ancient hills sink down.\nHis pathways are ancient.",
      "7": "I see the tents of Cushan in distress;\nthe tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.",
      "8": "Are you angry at the rivers, Lord?\nIs your wrath against the rivers?\nOr is your fury against the sea\nwhen you ride on your horses,\nyour victorious chariot?",
      "9": "You took the sheath from your bow;\nthe arrows are ready to be used with an oath. Selah\nYou split the earth with rivers.",
      "10": "The mountains see you and shudder;\na downpour of water sweeps by.\nThe deep roars with its voice\nand lifts its waves high.",
      "11": "Sun and moon stand still in their lofty residence,\nat the flash of your flying arrows,\nat the brightness of your shining spear.",
      "12": "You march across the earth with indignation;\nyou trample down the nations in wrath.",
      "13": "You come out to save your people,\nto save your anointed.\nYou crush the leader of the house of the wicked\nand strip him from foot to neck. Selah",
      "14": "You pierce his head\nwith his own spears;\nhis warriors storm out to scatter us,\ngloating as if ready to secretly devour the weak.",
      "15": "You tread the sea with your horses,\nstirring up the vast water.",
      "16": "I heard, and I trembled within;\nmy lips quivered at the sound.\nRottenness entered my bones;\nI trembled where I stood.\nNow I must quietly wait for the day of distress\nto come against the people invading us.",
      "17": "Though the fig tree does not bud\nand there is no fruit on the vines,\nthough the olive crop fails\nand the fields produce no food,\nthough the flocks disappear from the pen\nand there are no herds in the stalls,",
      "18": "yet I will celebrate in the Lord;\nI will rejoice in the God of my salvation!",
      "19": "The Lord my Lord is my strength;\nhe makes my feet like those of a deer\nand enables me to walk on mountain heights!\nFor the choir director: on stringed instruments."
