      "1": "There was a man from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "He had two wives, the first named Hannah and the second Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless.",
      "3": "This man would go up from his town every year to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of Armies at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were the Lord’s priests.",
      "4": "Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he always gave portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to each of her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "But he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved her even though the Lord had kept her from conceiving.",
      "6": "Her rival would taunt her severely just to provoke her, because the Lord had kept Hannah from conceiving.",
      "7": "Year after year, when she went up to the Lord’s house, her rival taunted her in this way. Hannah would weep and would not eat.",
      "8": "“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband, Elkanah, would ask. “Why won’t you eat? Why are you troubled? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "On one occasion, Hannah got up after they ate and drank at Shiloh. The priest Eli was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s temple.",
      "10": "Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the Lord and wept with many tears.",
      "11": "Making a vow, she pleaded, “Lord of Armies, if you will take notice of your servant’s affliction, remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and his hair will never be cut.”",
      "12": "While she continued praying in the Lord’s presence, Eli watched her mouth.",
      "13": "Hannah was praying silently, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. Eli thought she was drunk",
      "14": "and said to her, “How long are you going to be drunk? Get rid of your wine!”",
      "15": "“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman with a broken heart. I haven’t had any wine or beer; I’ve been pouring out my heart before the Lord.",
      "16": "Don’t think of me as a wicked woman; I’ve been praying from the depth of my anguish and resentment.”",
      "17": "Eli responded, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request you’ve made of him.”",
      "18": "“May your servant find favor with you,” she replied. Then Hannah went on her way; she ate and no longer looked despondent.",
      "19": "The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to worship before the Lord. Afterward, they returned home to Ramah. Then Elkanah was intimate with his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her.",
      "20": "After some time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, because she said, “I requested him from the Lord.”",
      "21": "When Elkanah and all his household went up to make the annual sacrifice and his vow offering to the Lord,",
      "22": "Hannah did not go and explained to her husband, “After the child is weaned, I’ll take him to appear in the Lord’s presence and to stay there permanently.”",
      "23": "Her husband, Elkanah, replied, “Do what you think is best, and stay here until you’ve weaned him. May the Lord confirm your word.” So Hannah stayed there and nursed her son until she weaned him.",
      "24": "When she had weaned him, she took him with her to Shiloh, as well as a three-year-old bull, half a bushel of flour, and a clay jar of wine. Though the boy was still young, she took him to the Lord’s house at Shiloh.",
      "25": "Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "“Please, my lord,” she said, “as surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord.",
      "27": "I prayed for this boy, and since the Lord gave me what I asked him for,",
      "28": "I now give the boy to the Lord. For as long as he lives, he is given to the Lord.” Then he worshiped the Lord there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Hannah prayed:\nMy heart rejoices in the Lord;\nmy horn is lifted up by the Lord.\nMy mouth boasts over my enemies,\nbecause I rejoice in your salvation.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like the Lord.\nThere is no one besides you!\nAnd there is no rock like our God.",
      "3": "Do not boast so proudly,\nor let arrogant words come out of your mouth,\nfor the Lord is a God of knowledge,\nand actions are weighed by him.",
      "4": "The bows of the warriors are broken,\nbut the feeble are clothed with strength.",
      "5": "Those who are full hire themselves out for food,\nbut those who are starving hunger no more.\nThe woman who is childless gives birth to seven,\nbut the woman with many sons pines away.",
      "6": "The Lord brings death and gives life;\nhe sends some down to Sheol, and he raises others up.",
      "7": "The Lord brings poverty and gives wealth;\nhe humbles and he exalts.",
      "8": "He raises the poor from the dust\nand lifts the needy from the trash heap.\nHe seats them with noblemen\nand gives them a throne of honor.\nFor the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s;\nhe has set the world on them.",
      "9": "He guards the steps of his faithful ones,\nbut the wicked perish in darkness,\nfor a person does not prevail by his own strength.",
      "10": "Those who oppose the Lord will be shattered;\nhe will thunder in the heavens against them.\nThe Lord will judge the ends of the earth.\nHe will give power to his king;\nhe will lift up the horn of his anointed.",
      "11": "Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy served the Lord in the presence of the priest Eli.",
      "12": "Eli’s sons were wicked men; they did not respect the Lord",
      "13": "or the priests’ share of the sacrifices from the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling",
      "14": "and plunge it into the container, kettle, cauldron, or cooking pot. The priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is the way they treated all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.",
      "15": "Even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he won’t accept boiled meat from you—only raw.”",
      "16": "If that person said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you can take whatever you want for yourself,” the servant would reply, “No, I insist that you hand it over right now. If you don’t, I’ll take it by force!”",
      "17": "So the servants’ sin was very severe in the presence of the Lord, because the men treated the Lord’s offering with contempt.",
      "18": "Samuel served in the Lord’s presence—this mere boy was dressed in the linen ephod.",
      "19": "Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.",
      "20": "Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife: “May the Lord give you children by this woman in place of the one she has given to the Lord.” Then they would go home.",
      "21": "The Lord paid attention to Hannah’s need, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.",
      "22": "Now Eli was very old. He heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "He said to them, “Why are you doing these things? I have heard about your evil actions from all these people.",
      "24": "No, my sons, the news I hear the Lord’s people spreading is not good.",
      "25": "If one person sins against another, God can intercede for him, but if a person sins against the Lord, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to their father, since the Lord intended to kill them.",
      "26": "By contrast, the boy Samuel grew in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.",
      "27": "A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Didn’t I reveal myself to your forefather’s family when they were in Egypt and belonged to Pharaoh’s palace?",
      "28": "Out of all the tribes of Israel, I chose your house to be my priests, to offer sacrifices on my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your forefather’s family all the Israelite food offerings.",
      "29": "Why, then, do all of you despise my sacrifices and offerings that I require at the place of worship? You have honored your sons more than me, by making yourselves fat with the best part of all of the offerings of my people Israel.’",
      "30": "“Therefore, this is the declaration of the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘I did say that your family and your forefather’s family would walk before me forever. But now,’ this is the Lord’s declaration, ‘no longer! For those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disgraced.",
      "31": "Look, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your forefather’s family, so that none in your family will reach old age.",
      "32": "You will see distress in the place of worship, in spite of all that is good in Israel, and no one in your family will ever again reach old age.",
      "33": "Any man from your family I do not cut off from my altar will bring grief and sadness to you. All your descendants will die violently.",
      "34": "This will be the sign that will come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: both of them will die on the same day.",
      "35": "“‘Then I will raise up a faithful priest for myself. He will do whatever is in my heart and mind. I will establish a lasting dynasty for him, and he will walk before my anointed one for all time.",
      "36": "Anyone who is left in your family will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread. He will say: Please appoint me to some priestly office so I can have a piece of bread to eat.’”"

      "1": "The boy Samuel served the Lord in Eli’s presence. In those days the word of the Lord was rare and prophetic visions were not widespread.",
      "2": "One day Eli, whose eyesight was failing, was lying in his usual place.",
      "3": "Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was located.",
      "4": "Then the Lord called Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.”",
      "5": "He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”\n“I didn’t call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.",
      "6": "Once again the Lord called, “Samuel!”\nSamuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.”\n“I didn’t call, my son,” he replied. “Go back and lie down.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, because the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "Once again, for the third time, the Lord called Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.”\nThen Eli understood that the Lord was calling the boy.",
      "9": "He told Samuel, “Go and lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "The Lord came, stood there, and called as before, “Samuel, Samuel!”\nSamuel responded, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”",
      "11": "The Lord said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel that will cause everyone who hears about it to shudder.",
      "12": "On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I said about his family, from beginning to end.",
      "13": "I told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knows about: his sons are cursing God, and he has not stopped them.",
      "14": "Therefore, I have sworn to Eli’s family: The iniquity of Eli’s family will never be wiped out by either sacrifice or offering.”",
      "15": "Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the Lord’s house. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,",
      "16": "but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”\n“Here I am,” answered Samuel.",
      "17": "“What was the message he gave you?” Eli asked. “Don’t hide it from me. May God punish you and do so severely if you hide anything from me that he told you.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him everything and did not hide anything from him. Eli responded, “He is the Lord. Let him do what he thinks is good.”",
      "19": "Samuel grew. The Lord was with him, and he fulfilled everything Samuel prophesied.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the Lord.",
      "21": "The Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, because there he revealed himself to Samuel by his word."

    "4": {
      "1": "And Samuel’s words came to all Israel.\nIsrael went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines lined up in battle formation against Israel, and as the battle intensified, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield.",
      "3": "When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord defeat us today before the Philistines? Let’s bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh. Then it will go with us and save us from our enemies.”",
      "4": "So the people sent men to Shiloh to bring back the ark of the covenant of the Lord of Armies, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
      "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a loud shout that the ground shook.",
      "6": "The Philistines heard the sound of the war cry and asked, “What’s this loud shout in the Hebrews’ camp?” When the Philistines discovered that the ark of the Lord had entered the camp,",
      "7": "they panicked. “A god has entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before.",
      "8": "Woe to us! Who will rescue us from these magnificent gods? These are the gods that slaughtered the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.",
      "9": "Show some courage and be men, Philistines! Otherwise, you’ll serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was severe—thirty thousand of the Israelite foot soldiers fell.",
      "11": "The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "That same day, a Benjaminite man ran from the battle and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn, and there was dirt on his head.",
      "13": "When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair beside the road waiting, because he was anxious about the ark of God. When the man entered the city to give a report, the entire city cried out.",

      "15": "At that time Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes didn’t move because he couldn’t see.",
      "16": "The man said to Eli, “I’m the one who came from the battle. I fled from there today.”\n“What happened, my son?” Eli asked.",
      "17": "The messenger answered, “Israel has fled from the Philistines, and also there was a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”",
      "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off the chair by the city gate, and since he was old and heavy, his neck broke and he died. Eli had judged Israel forty years.",

      "20": "As she was dying, the women taking care of her said, “Don’t be afraid. You’ve given birth to a son!” But she did not respond or pay attention.",

      "4": "But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. This time, Dagon’s head and both of his hands were broken off and lying on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso remained.",
      "5": "That is why, still today, the priests of Dagon and everyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on Dagon’s threshold.",
      "6": "The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod. He terrified the people of Ashdod and its territory and afflicted them with tumors.",
      "7": "When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of Israel’s God must not stay here with us, because his hand is strongly against us and our god Dagon.”",
      "8": "So they called all the Philistine rulers together and asked, “What should we do with the ark of Israel’s God?”\n“The ark of Israel’s God should be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they moved the ark of Israel’s God.",
      "9": "After they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against the city of Gath, causing a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, with an outbreak of tumors.",

      "11": "The Ekronites called all the Philistine rulers together. They said, “Send the ark of Israel’s God away. Let it return to its place so it won’t kill us and our people!” For the fear of death pervaded the city; God’s hand was oppressing them.",

      "3": "They replied, “If you send the ark of Israel’s God away, do not send it without an offering. Send back a guilt offering to him, and you will be healed. Then the reason his hand hasn’t been removed from you will be revealed.”",
      "4": "They asked, “What guilt offering should we send back to him?”\nAnd they answered, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice corresponding to the number of Philistine rulers, since there was one plague for both you and your rulers.",
      "5": "Make images of your tumors and of your mice that are destroying the land. Give glory to Israel’s God, and perhaps he will stop oppressing you, your gods, and your land.",

      "9": "Then watch: If it goes up the road to its homeland toward Beth-shemesh, it is the Lord who has made this terrible trouble for us. However, if it doesn’t, we will know that it was not his hand that punished us—it was just something that happened to us by chance.”",
      "10": "The men did this: They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and confined their calves in the pen.",
      "11": "Then they put the ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors.",
      "12": "The cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on that one highway, lowing as they went; they never strayed to the right or to the left. The Philistine rulers were walking behind them to the territory of Beth-shemesh.",

      "7": "“Suppose we do go,” Saul said to his servant, “what do we take the man? The food from our packs is gone, and there’s no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”",

      "21": "Saul responded, “Am I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel’s tribes and isn’t my clan the least important of all the clans of the Benjaminite tribe? So why have you said something like this to me?”",
      "22": "Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the thirty or so men who had been invited.",

      "8": "Then Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy to you. Let me thrust the spear through him into the ground just once. I won’t have to strike him twice!”",
      "9": "But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the Lord’s anointed and be innocent?”",
      "10": "David added, “As the Lord lives, the Lord will certainly strike him down: either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.",
      "11": "However, as the Lord is my witness, I will never lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and the water jug by his head, and let’s go.”",
      "12": "So David took the spear and the water jug by Saul’s head, and they went their way. No one saw them, no one knew, and no one woke up; they all remained asleep because a deep sleep from the Lord came over them.",
      "13": "David crossed to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance; there was a considerable space between them.",
      "14": "Then David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer, Abner?”\n“Who are you who calls to the king?” Abner asked.",
      "15": "David called to Abner, “You’re a man, aren’t you? Who in Israel is your equal? So why didn’t you protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him?",
      "16": "What you have done is not good. As the Lord lives, all of you deserve to die since you didn’t protect your lord, the Lord’s anointed. Now look around; where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?”",
      "17": "Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, my son David?” \n“It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said.",
      "18": "Then he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What crime have I committed?",
      "19": "Now, may my lord the king please hear the words of his servant: If it is the Lord who has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. But if it is people, may they be cursed in the presence of the Lord, for today they have banished me from sharing in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, ‘Go and worship other gods.’",
      "20": "So don’t let my blood fall to the ground far from the Lord’s presence, for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, like one who pursues a partridge in the mountains.”",
      "21": "Saul responded, “I have sinned. Come back, my son David, I will never harm you again because today you considered my life precious. I have been a fool! I’ve committed a grave error.”",
      "22": "David answered, “Here is the king’s spear; have one of the young men come over and get it.",
      "23": "The Lord will repay every man for his righteousness and his loyalty. I wasn’t willing to lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed, even though the Lord handed you over to me today.",
      "24": "Just as I considered your life valuable today, so may the Lord consider my life valuable and rescue me from all trouble.”",
      "25": "Saul said to him, “You are blessed, my son David. You will certainly do great things and will also prevail.” Then David went on his way, and Saul returned home."

      "1": "David said to himself, “One of these days I’ll be swept away by Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape immediately to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me everywhere in Israel, and I’ll escape from him.”",
      "2": "So David set out with his six hundred men and went over to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.",
      "3": "David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow.",
      "4": "When it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.",
      "5": "Now David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”",
      "6": "That day Achish gave Ziklag to him, and it still belongs to the kings of Judah today.",
      "7": "The length of time that David stayed in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months.",
      "8": "David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. From ancient times they had been the inhabitants of the region through Shur as far as the land of Egypt.",
      "9": "Whenever David attacked the land, he did not leave a single person alive, either man or woman, but he took flocks, herds, donkeys, camels, and clothing. Then he came back to Achish,",
      "10": "who inquired, “Where did you raid today?” \nDavid replied, “The south country of Judah,” “The south country of the Jerahmeelites,” or “The south country of the Kenites.”",
      "11": "David did not let a man or woman live to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Or they will inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’” This was David’s custom during the whole time he stayed in the Philistine territory.",
      "12": "So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since he has made himself repulsive to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever.”"

      "1": "At that time, the Philistines gathered their military units into one army to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, “You know, of course, that you and your men must march out in the army with me.”",
      "2": "David replied to Achish, “Good, you will find out what your servant can do.”\nSo Achish said to David, “Very well, I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard.”",
      "3": "By this time Samuel had died, all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his city, and Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.",
      "4": "The Philistines gathered and camped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at Gilboa.",
      "5": "When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and his heart pounded.",
      "6": "He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him in dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.",
      "7": "Saul then said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.”\nHis servants replied, “There is a woman at En-dor who is a medium.”",
      "8": "Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes and set out with two of his men. They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me. Bring up for me the one I tell you.”",
      "9": "But the woman said to him, “You surely know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you setting a trap for me to get me killed?”",
      "10": "Then Saul swore to her by the Lord: “As surely as the Lord lives, no punishment will come to you from this.”",
      "11": "“Who is it that you want me to bring up for you?” the woman asked.\n“Bring up Samuel for me,” he answered.",
      "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, and then she asked Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!”",
      "13": "But the king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”\n“I see a spirit form coming up out of the earth,” the woman answered.",
      "14": "Then Saul asked her, “What does he look like?”\n“An old man is coming up,” she replied. “He’s wearing a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he knelt low with his face to the ground and paid homage.",
      "15": "“Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Samuel asked Saul.\n“I’m in serious trouble,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He doesn’t answer me anymore, either through the prophets or in dreams. So I’ve called on you to tell me what I should do.”",
      "16": "Samuel answered, “Since the Lord has turned away from you and has become your enemy, why are you asking me?",
      "17": "The Lord has done exactly what he said through me: The Lord has torn the kingship out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David.",
      "18": "You did not obey the Lord and did not carry out his burning anger against Amalek; therefore the Lord has done this to you today.",
      "19": "The Lord will also hand Israel over to the Philistines along with you. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the Lord will hand Israel’s army over to the Philistines.”",
      "20": "Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was terrified by Samuel’s words and was also weak because he had not eaten anything all day and all night.",
      "21": "The woman came over to Saul, and she saw that he was terrified and said to him, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.",
      "22": "Now please listen to your servant. Let me set some food in front of you. Eat and it will give you strength so you can go on your way.”",
      "23": "He refused, saying, “I won’t eat,” but when his servants and the woman urged him, he listened to them. He got up off the ground and sat on the bed.",
      "24": "The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.",
      "25": "She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Afterward, they got up and left that night."

      "3": "Then the Philistine commanders asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”\nAchish answered the Philistine commanders, “That is David, servant of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me a considerable period of time. From the day he defected until today, I’ve found no fault with him.”",
      "4": "The Philistine commanders, however, were enraged with Achish and told him, “Send that man back and let him return to the place you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle only to become our adversary during the battle. What better way could he ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of our men?",
      "5": "Isn’t this the David they sing about during their dances:\nSaul has killed his thousands,\nbut David his tens of thousands?”",
      "6": "So Achish summoned David and told him, “As the Lord lives, you are an honorable man. I think it is good to have you fighting in this unit with me, because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until today. But the leaders don’t think you are reliable.",
      "7": "Now go back quietly and you won’t be doing anything the Philistine leaders think is wrong.”",
      "8": "“But what have I done?” David replied to Achish. “From the first day I entered your service until today, what have you found against your servant to keep me from going to fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”",
      "9": "Achish answered David, “I’m convinced that you are as reliable as an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go into battle with us.’",
      "10": "So get up early in the morning, you and your masters’ servants who came with you. When you’ve all gotten up early, go as soon as it’s light.”",
