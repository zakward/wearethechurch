      "3": "What does a person gain for all his efforts\nthat he labors at under the sun?",
      "4": "A generation goes and a generation comes,\nbut the earth remains forever.",
      "5": "The sun rises and the sun sets;\npanting, it hurries back to the place\nwhere it rises.",
      "6": "Gusting to the south,\nturning to the north,\nturning, turning, goes the wind,\nand the wind returns in its cycles.",
      "7": "All the streams flow to the sea,\nyet the sea is never full;\nto the place where the streams flow,\nthere they flow again.",
      "8": "All things are wearisome,\nmore than anyone can say.\nThe eye is not satisfied by seeing\nor the ear filled with hearing.",
      "9": "What has been is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Can one say about anything,\n“Look, this is new”?\nIt has already existed in the ages before us.",
      "11": "There is no remembrance of those who came before;\nand of those who will come after\nthere will also be no remembrance\nby those who follow them.",
      "12": "I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I applied my mind to examine and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people this miserable task to keep them occupied.",
      "14": "I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be straightened;\nwhat is lacking cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I said to myself, “See, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind.",
      "18": "For with much wisdom is much sorrow;\nas knowledge increases, grief increases."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "I said to myself, “Go ahead, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good.” But it turned out to be futile.",
      "2": "I said about laughter, “It is madness,” and about pleasure, “What does this accomplish?”",
      "3": "I explored with my mind the pull of wine on my body—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—and how to grasp folly, until I could see what is good for people to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.",
      "4": "I increased my achievements. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.",
      "5": "I made gardens and parks for myself and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.",
      "6": "I constructed reservoirs for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.",
      "7": "I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house. I also owned livestock—large herds and flocks—more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered male and female singers for myself, and many concubines, the delights of men.",
      "9": "So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom also remained with me.",
      "10": "All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them. I did not refuse myself any pleasure, for I took pleasure in all my struggles. This was my reward for all my struggles.",
      "11": "When I considered all that I had accomplished and what I had labored to achieve, I found everything to be futile and a pursuit of the wind. There was nothing to be gained under the sun.",
      "12": "Then I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly, for what will the king’s successor be like? He will do what has already been done.",
      "13": "And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness.",
      "14": "The wise person has eyes in his head,\nbut the fool walks in darkness.\nYet I also knew that one fate comes to them both.",
      "15": "So I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise?” And I said to myself that this is also futile.",
      "16": "For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise, since in the days to come both will be forgotten. How is it that the wise person dies just like the fool?",
      "17": "Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.",
      "18": "I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the one who comes after me.",
      "19": "And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.",
      "20": "So I began to give myself over to despair concerning all my work that I had labored at under the sun.",
      "21": "When there is a person whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a person who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great wrong.",
      "22": "For what does a person get with all his work and all his efforts that he labors at under the sun?",
      "23": "For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.",
      "24": "There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. I have seen that even this is from God’s hand,",
      "25": "because who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from him?",
      "26": "For to the person who is pleasing in his sight, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and accumulating in order to give to the one who is pleasing in God’s sight. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind."

      "12": "I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the good life.",
      "13": "It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts.",
      "14": "I know that everything God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it. God works so that people will be in awe of him.",
      "15": "Whatever is, has already been, and whatever will be, already is. However, God seeks justice for the persecuted.",
      "16": "I also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness.",
      "17": "I said to myself, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every work.”",
      "18": "I said to myself, “This happens so that God may test the children of Adam and they may see for themselves that they are like animals.”",
      "19": "For the fate of the children of Adam and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals since everything is futile.",

      "21": "Who knows if the spirits of the children of Adam go upward and the spirits of animals go downward to the earth?",

      "2": "So I commended the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.",
      "3": "But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.",
      "4": "I saw that all labor and all skillful work is due to one person’s jealousy of another. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.",

      "6": "Better one handful with rest\nthan two handfuls with effort and a pursuit of the wind.",
      "7": "Again, I saw futility under the sun:",
      "8": "There is a person without a companion, without even a son or brother, and though there is no end to all his struggles, his eyes are still not content with riches. “Who am I struggling for,” he asks, “and depriving myself of good things?” This too is futile and a miserable task.",
      "9": "Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts.",
      "10": "For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up.",
      "11": "Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm?",
      "12": "And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.",
      "13": "Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings.",
      "14": "For he came from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.",
      "15": "I saw all the living, who move about under the sun, follow a second youth who succeeds him.",

      "5": "Better that you do not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.",
      "6": "Do not let your mouth bring guilt on you, and do not say in the presence of the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?",
      "7": "For many dreams bring futility; so do many words. Therefore, fear God.",
      "8": "If you see oppression of the poor and perversion of justice and righteousness in the province, don’t be astonished at the situation, because one official protects another official, and higher officials protect them.",

      "12": "The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich permits him no sleep.",
      "13": "There is a sickening tragedy I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.",
      "14": "That wealth was lost in a bad venture, so when he fathered a son, he was empty-handed.",
      "15": "As he came from his mother’s womb, so he will go again, naked as he came; he will take nothing for his efforts that he can carry in his hands.",

      "18": "Here is what I have seen to be good: It is appropriate to eat, drink, and experience good in all the labor one does under the sun during the few days of his life God has given him, because that is his reward.",
      "19": "Furthermore, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth, he has also allowed him to enjoy them, take his reward, and rejoice in his labor. This is a gift of God,",

As it is for the good, so also it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who takes an oath, so also for the one who fears an oath.",

      "8": "Indeed, if someone lives many years,\nlet him rejoice in them all,\nand let him remember the days of darkness, since they will be many.\nAll that comes is futile.",
      "9": "Rejoice, young person, while you are young,\nand let your heart be glad in the days of your youth.\nAnd walk in the ways of your heart\nand in the desire of your eyes;\nbut know that for all of these things God will bring you to judgment.",
      "10": "Remove sorrow from your heart,\nand put away pain from your flesh,\nbecause youth and the prime of life are fleeting."

      "1": "So remember your Creator in the days of your youth:\nBefore the days of adversity come,\nand the years approach when you will say,\n“I have no delight in them”;",
      "2": "before the sun and the light are darkened,\nand the moon and the stars,\nand the clouds return after the rain;",
      "3": "on the day when the guardians of the house tremble,\nand the strong men stoop,\nthe women who grind grain cease because they are few,\nand the ones who watch through the windows see dimly,",
      "4": "the doors at the street are shut\nwhile the sound of the mill fades;\nwhen one rises at the sound of a bird,\nand all the daughters of song grow faint.",
      "5": "Also, they are afraid of heights and dangers on the road;\nthe almond tree blossoms,\nthe grasshopper loses its spring,\nand the caper berry has no effect;\nfor the mere mortal is headed to his eternal home,\nand mourners will walk around in the street;",
