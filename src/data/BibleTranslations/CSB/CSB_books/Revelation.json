      "11": "saying, “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”",
      "12": "Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me. When I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,",
      "13": "and among the lampstands was one like the Son of Man, dressed in a robe and with a golden sash wrapped around his chest.",
      "14": "The hair of his head was white as wool—white as snow—and his eyes like a fiery flame.",
      "15": "His feet were like fine bronze as it is fired in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of cascading waters.",
      "16": "He had seven stars in his right hand; a sharp double-edged sword came from his mouth, and his face was shining like the sun at full strength.",
      "17": "When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid. I am the First and the Last,",
      "18": "and the Living One. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades.",
      "19": "Therefore write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this.",
      "20": "The mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."

      "1": "“Write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: Thus says the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven golden lampstands:",
      "2": "I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you have found them to be liars.",
      "3": "I know that you have persevered and endured hardships for the sake of my name, and you have not grown weary.",
      "4": "But I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.",
      "5": "Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.",
      "6": "Yet you do have this: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.",
      "7": "“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.",

      "10": "Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will experience affliction for ten days. Be faithful to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.",

      "14": "But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block in front of the Israelites: to eat meat sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.",
      "15": "In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.",
      "16": "So repent! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.",
      "17": "“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.",
      "18": "“Write to the angel of the church in Thyatira: Thus says the Son of God, the one whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like fine bronze:",
      "19": "I know your works—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. I know that your last works are greater than the first.",

      "21": "I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality.",
      "22": "Look, I will throw her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction. Unless they repent of her works,",
      "23": "I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who examines minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works.",
      "24": "I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who haven’t known “the so-called secrets of Satan” —as they say—I am not putting any other burden on you.",
      "25": "Only hold on to what you have until I come.",

      "27": "and he will rule them with an iron scepter;\nhe will shatter them like pottery —",
      "28": "just as I have received this from my Father. I will also give him the morning star.",

      "2": "Be alert and strengthen what remains, which is about to die, for I have not found your works complete before my God.",
      "3": "Remember, then, what you have received and heard; keep it, and repent. If you are not alert, I will come like a thief, and you have no idea at what hour I will come upon you.",
      "4": "But you have a few people in Sardis who have not defiled their clothes, and they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.",

      "9": "Note this: I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying—I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.",
      "10": "Because you have kept my command to endure, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is going to come on the whole world to test those who live on the earth.",
