    "1": {
      "1": "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—",
      "2": "which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures—",
      "3": "concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh",
      "4": "and was appointed to be the powerful Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection of the dead.",
      "5": "Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles,",
      "6": "including you who are also called by Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints.\nGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world.",
      "9": "God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in telling the good news about his Son—that I constantly mention you,",
      "10": "always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.",
      "11": "For I want very much to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,",
      "12": "that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.",
      "13": "Now I don’t want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now) in order that I might have a fruitful ministry among you, just as I have had among the rest of the Gentiles.",
      "14": "I am obligated both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and the foolish.",
      "15": "So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.",
      "17": "For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.",
      "18": "For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth,",
      "19": "since what can be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them.",
      "20": "For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being understood through what he has made. As a result, people are without excuse.",
      "21": "For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened.",
      "22": "Claiming to be wise, they became fools",
      "23": "and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.",
      "24": "Therefore God delivered them over in the desires of their hearts to sexual impurity, so that their bodies were degraded among themselves.",
      "25": "They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served what has been created instead of the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen.",
      "26": "For this reason God delivered them over to disgraceful passions. Their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.",
      "27": "The men in the same way also left natural relations with women and were inflamed in their lust for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the appropriate penalty of their error.",
      "28": "And because they did not think it worthwhile to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right.",
      "29": "They are filled with all unrighteousness, evil, greed, and wickedness. They are full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,",
      "30": "slanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,",
      "31": "senseless, untrustworthy, unloving, and unmerciful.",
      "32": "Although they know God’s just sentence—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do them, but even applaud others who practice them."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore, every one of you who judges is without excuse. For when you judge another, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things.",
      "2": "Now we know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth.",
      "3": "Do you think—anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same—that you will escape God’s judgment?",
      "4": "Or do you despise the riches of his kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?",
      "5": "Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.",
      "6": "He will repay each one according to his works:",
      "7": "eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality;",
      "8": "but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness.",
      "9": "There will be affliction and distress for every human being who does evil, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek;",
      "10": "but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does what is good, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.",
      "11": "For there is no favoritism with God.",
      "12": "For all who sin without the law will also perish without the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.",
      "13": "For the hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.",
      "14": "So, when Gentiles, who do not by nature have the law, do what the law demands, they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law.",
      "15": "They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts. Their consciences confirm this. Their competing thoughts either accuse or even excuse them",
      "16": "on the day when God judges what people have kept secret, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus.",
      "17": "Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast in God,",
      "18": "and know his will, and approve the things that are superior, being instructed from the law,",
      "19": "and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,",
      "20": "an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and truth in the law—",
      "21": "you then, who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach, “You must not steal”—do you steal?",
      "22": "You who say, “You must not commit adultery”—do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?",
      "23": "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",
      "24": "For, as it is written: The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.",
      "25": "Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
      "26": "So if an uncircumcised man keeps the law’s requirements, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?",
      "27": "A man who is physically uncircumcised, but who keeps the law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker in spite of having the letter of the law and circumcision.",
      "28": "For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, and true circumcision is not something visible in the flesh.",
      "29": "On the contrary, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart—by the Spirit, not the letter. That person’s praise is not from people but from God."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "So what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?",
      "2": "Considerable in every way. First, they were entrusted with the very words of God.",
      "3": "What then? If some were unfaithful, will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?",
      "4": "Absolutely not! Let God be true, even though everyone is a liar, as it is written:\nThat you may be justified in your words\nand triumph when you judge.",
      "5": "But if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, what are we to say? I am using a human argument: Is God unrighteous to inflict wrath?",
      "6": "Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?",
      "7": "But if by my lie God’s truth abounds to his glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "And why not say, just as some people slanderously claim we say, “Let us do what is evil so that good may come”? Their condemnation is deserved!",
      "9": "What then? Are we any better off? Not at all! For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,",
      "10": "as it is written:\nThere is no one righteous, not even one.",
      "11": "There is no one who understands;\nthere is no one who seeks God.",
      "12": "All have turned away;\nall alike have become worthless.\nThere is no one who does what is good,\nnot even one.",
      "13": "Their throat is an open grave;\nthey deceive with their tongues.\nVipers’ venom is under their lips.",
      "14": "Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.",
      "15": "Their feet are swift to shed blood;",
      "16": "ruin and wretchedness are in their paths,",
      "17": "and the path of peace they have not known.",
      "18": "There is no fear of God before their eyes.",
      "19": "Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are subject to the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become subject to God’s judgment.",
      "20": "For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.",
      "21": "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets.",
      "22": "The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, since there is no distinction.",
      "23": "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;",
      "24": "they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.",
      "25": "God presented him as the mercy seat by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed.",
      "26": "God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.",
      "27": "Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By one of works? No, on the contrary, by a law of faith.",
      "28": "For we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.",
      "29": "Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,",
      "30": "since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.",
      "31": "Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?",
      "2": "If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about—but not before God.",
      "3": "For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.",
      "4": "Now to the one who works, pay is not credited as a gift, but as something owed.",
      "5": "But to the one who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness.",
      "6": "Likewise, David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:",
      "7": "Blessed are those whose lawless acts are forgiven\nand whose sins are covered.",
      "8": "Blessed is the person\nthe Lord will never charge with sin.",
      "9": "Is this blessing only for the circumcised, then? Or is it also for the uncircumcised? For we say, Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.",
      "10": "In what way, then, was it credited—while he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? It was not while he was circumcised, but uncircumcised.",
      "11": "And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while still uncircumcised. This was to make him the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, so that righteousness may be credited to them also.",
      "12": "And he became the father of the circumcised, who are not only circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.",
      "13": "For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.",
      "14": "If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made empty and the promise nullified,",
      "15": "because the law produces wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.",
      "16": "This is why the promise is by faith, so that it may be according to grace, to guarantee it to all the descendants—not only to the one who is of the law but also to the one who is of Abraham’s faith. He is the father of us all.",
      "17": "As it is written: I have made you the father of many nations—in the presence of the God in whom he believed,the one who gives life to the dead and calls things into existence that do not exist.",
      "18": "He believed, hoping against hope, so that he became the father of many nations according to what had been spoken: So will your descendants be.",
      "19": "He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body to be already dead (since he was about a hundred years old) and also the deadness of Sarah’s womb.",
      "20": "He did not waver in unbelief at God’s promise but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,",
      "21": "because he was fully convinced that what God had promised, he was also able to do.",
      "22": "Therefore, it was credited to him for righteousness.",
      "23": "Now it was credited to him was not written for Abraham alone,",
      "24": "but also for us. It will be credited to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.",
      "25": "He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "2": "We have also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.",
      "3": "And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance,",
      "4": "endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope.",
      "5": "This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",
      "6": "For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.",
      "7": "For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.",
      "8": "But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
      "9": "How much more then, since we have now been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.",
      "10": "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, then how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life.",
      "11": "And not only that, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.",
      "12": "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned.",
      "13": "In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to a person’s account when there is no law.",
      "14": "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression. He is a type of the Coming One.",
      "15": "But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.",
      "16": "And the gift is not like the one man’s sin, because from one sin came the judgment, resulting in condemnation, but from many trespasses came the gift, resulting in justification.",
      "17": "If by the one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is justification leading to life for everyone.",
      "19": "For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.",
      "20": "The law came along to multiply the trespass. But where sin multiplied, grace multiplied even more",
      "21": "so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply?",
      "2": "Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?",
      "3": "Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
      "4": "Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life.",
      "5": "For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection.",
      "6": "For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin,",
      "7": "since a person who has died is freed from sin.",
      "8": "Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,",
      "9": "because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will not die again. Death no longer rules over him.",
      "10": "For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God.",
      "11": "So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
      "12": "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires.",
      "13": "And do not offer any parts of it to sin as weapons for unrighteousness. But as those who are alive from the dead, offer yourselves to God, and all the parts of yourselves to God as weapons for righteousness.",
      "14": "For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law but under grace.",
      "15": "What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not!",
      "16": "Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of that one you obey—either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness?",
      "17": "But thank God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching to which you were handed over,",
      "18": "and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.",
      "19": "I am using a human analogy because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification.",
      "20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.",
      "21": "So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? The outcome of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the outcome is eternal life!",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Since I am speaking to those who know the law, brothers and sisters, don’t you know that the law rules over someone as long as he lives?",
      "2": "For example, a married woman is legally bound to her husband while he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law regarding the husband.",
      "3": "So then, if she is married to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then, if she is married to another man, she is not an adulteress.",
      "4": "Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another. You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.",
      "5": "For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused through the law were working in us to bear fruit for death.",
      "6": "But now we have been released from the law, since we have died to what held us, so that we may serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the old letter of the law.",
      "7": "What should we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But I would not have known sin if it were not for the law. For example, I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, Do not covet.",
      "8": "And sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind. For apart from the law sin is dead.",
      "9": "Once I was alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life again",
      "10": "and I died. The commandment that was meant for life resulted in death for me.",
      "11": "For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.",
      "12": "So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.",
      "13": "Therefore, did what is good become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, in order to be recognized as sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment, sin might become sinful beyond measure.",
      "14": "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold as a slave under sin.",
      "15": "For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate.",
      "16": "Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good.",
      "17": "So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me.",
      "18": "For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it.",
      "19": "For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do.",
      "20": "Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one that does it, but it is the sin that lives in me.",
      "21": "So I discover this law: When I want to do what is good, evil is present with me.",
      "22": "For in my inner self I delight in God’s law,",
      "23": "but I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.",
      "24": "What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?",
      "25": "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am serving the law of God, but with my flesh, the law of sin."
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus,",
      "2": "because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.",
      "3": "For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering,",
      "4": "in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.",
      "5": "For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit.",
      "6": "Now the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace.",
      "7": "The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God’s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so.",
      "8": "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.",
      "9": "You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.",
      "10": "Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.",
      "11": "And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.",
      "12": "So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh,",
      "13": "because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.",
      "14": "For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons.",
      "15": "For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”",
      "16": "The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,",
      "17": "and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and coheirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.",
      "18": "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.",
      "19": "For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed.",
      "20": "For the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in the hope",
      "21": "that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.",
      "22": "For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now.",
      "23": "Not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits—we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.",
      "24": "Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?",
