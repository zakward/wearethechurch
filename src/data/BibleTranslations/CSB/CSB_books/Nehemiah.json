      "1": "The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:\nDuring the month of Chislev in the twentieth year, when I was in the fortress city of Susa,",
      "2": "Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah, and I questioned them about Jerusalem and the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile.",
      "3": "They said to me, “The remnant in the province, who survived the exile, are in great trouble and disgrace. Jerusalem’s wall has been broken down, and its gates have been burned.”",
      "4": "When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.",
      "5": "I said,\nLord, the God of the heavens, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps his gracious covenant with those who love him and keep his commands,",
      "6": "let your eyes be open and your ears be attentive to hear your servant’s prayer that I now pray to you day and night for your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we have committed against you. Both I and my father’s family have sinned.",
      "7": "We have acted corruptly toward you and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances you gave your servant Moses.",
      "8": "Please remember what you commanded your servant Moses: “If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples.",
      "9": "But if you return to me and carefully observe my commands, even though your exiles were banished to the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I chose to have my name dwell.”",
      "10": "They are your servants and your people. You redeemed them by your great power and strong hand.",
      "11": "Please, Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to that of your servants who delight to revere your name. Give your servant success today, and grant him compassion in the presence of this man.\nAt the time, I was the king’s cupbearer."

      "1": "During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence,",
      "2": "so the king said to me, “Why do you look so sad, when you aren’t sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.”\nI was overwhelmed with fear",
      "3": "and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”",
      "4": "Then the king asked me, “What is your request?”\nSo I prayed to the God of the heavens",
      "5": "and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I may rebuild it.”",
      "6": "The king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So I gave him a definite time, and it pleased the king to send me.",
      "7": "I also said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.",
      "8": "And let me have a letter written to Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple’s fortress, the city wall, and the home where I will live.” The king granted my requests, for the gracious hand of my God was on me.",
      "9": "I went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent officers of the infantry and cavalry with me.",
      "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard that someone had come to pursue the prosperity of the Israelites, they were greatly displeased.",
      "11": "After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,",
      "12": "I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the one I was riding.",
      "13": "I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent’s Well and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.",
      "14": "I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but farther down it became too narrow for my animal to go through.",
      "15": "So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate and returned.",
      "16": "The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work.",
      "17": "So I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned. Come, let’s rebuild Jerusalem’s wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”",
      "18": "I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me, and what the king had said to me.\nThey said, “Let’s start rebuilding,” and their hands were strengthened to do this good work.",
      "19": "When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they mocked and despised us, and said, “What is this you’re doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”",
      "20": "I gave them this reply, “The God of the heavens is the one who will grant us success. We, his servants, will start building, but you have no share, right, or historic claim in Jerusalem.”"

      "1": "When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious. He mocked the Jews",
      "2": "before his colleagues and the powerful men of Samaria and said, “What are these pathetic Jews doing? Can they restore it by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they ever finish it? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”",
      "3": "Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “Indeed, even if a fox climbed up what they are building, he would break down their stone wall!”",
      "4": "Listen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.",
      "5": "Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from your sight, because they have angered the builders.",
      "6": "So we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had the will to keep working.",
      "7": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they became furious.",
      "8": "They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion.",
      "9": "So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.",

      "11": "And our enemies said, “They won’t realize it until we’re among them and can kill them and stop the work.”",
      "12": "When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again, “Everywhere you turn, they attack us.”",
      "13": "So I stationed people behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "After I made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord, and fight for your countrymen, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes.”",
      "15": "When our enemies heard that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall.",
      "16": "From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers supported all the people of Judah,",
      "17": "who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried the loads worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.",
      "18": "Each of the builders had his sword strapped around his waist while he was building, and the one who sounded the ram’s horn was beside me.",
      "19": "Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The work is enormous and spread out, and we are separated far from one another along the wall.",
      "20": "Wherever you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!”",
      "21": "So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out.",
      "22": "At that time, I also said to the people, “Let everyone and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.”",
      "23": "And I, my brothers, my servants, and the men of the guard with me never took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing."

      "1": "There was a widespread outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen.",
      "2": "Some were saying, “We, our sons, and our daughters are numerous. Let us get grain so that we can eat and live.”",
      "3": "Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine.”",
      "4": "Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.",
      "5": "We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "I became extremely angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.",
      "7": "After seriously considering the matter, I accused the nobles and officials, saying to them, “Each of you is charging his countrymen interest.” So I called a large assembly against them",
      "8": "and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish countrymen who were sold to foreigners, but now you sell your own countrymen, and we have to buy them back.” They remained silent and could not say a word.",
      "9": "Then I said, “What you are doing isn’t right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God and not invite the reproach of our foreign enemies?",
      "10": "Even I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending them money and grain. Please, let’s stop charging this interest.",
      "11": "Return their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses to them immediately, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and fresh oil that you have been assessing them.”",
      "12": "They responded, “We will return these things and require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.”\nSo I summoned the priests and made everyone take an oath to do this.",
      "13": "I also shook the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake from his house and property everyone who doesn’t keep this promise. May he be shaken out and have nothing!”\nThe whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the Lord. Then the people did as they had promised.",
      "14": "Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah—from the twentieth year until his thirty-second year, twelve years—I and my associates never ate from the food allotted to the governor.",
      "15": "The governors who preceded me had heavily burdened the people, taking from them food and wine as well as a pound of silver. Their subordinates also oppressed the people, but because of the fear of God, I didn’t do this.",
      "16": "Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of this wall, and all my subordinates were gathered there for the work. We didn’t buy any land.",
      "17": "There were 150 Jews and officials, as well as guests from the surrounding nations at my table.",
      "18": "Each day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me. An abundance of all kinds of wine was provided every ten days. But I didn’t demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy.",
      "19": "Remember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people."

      "1": "When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gap was left in it—though at that time I had not installed the doors in the city gates—",
      "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message: “Come, let’s meet together in the villages of the Ono Valley.” They were planning to harm me.",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing important work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”",
      "4": "Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply.",
      "5": "Sanballat sent me this same message a fifth time by his aide, who had an open letter in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written:\nIt is reported among the nations—and Geshem agrees—that you and the Jews plan to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king",
      "7": "and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf, “There is a king in Judah.” These rumors will be heard by the king. So come, let’s confer together.",
      "8": "Then I replied to him, “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”",
      "9": "For they were all trying to intimidate us, saying, “They will drop their hands from the work, and it will never be finished.”\nBut now, my God, strengthen my hands.",
      "10": "I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted to his house. He said:\nLet’s meet at the house of God,\ninside the temple.\nLet’s shut the temple doors\nbecause they’re coming to kill you.\nThey’re coming to kill you tonight!",
      "11": "But I said, “Should a man like me run away? How can someone like me enter the temple and live? I will not go.”",
      "12": "I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
      "13": "He was hired, so that I would be intimidated, do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me.",
      "14": "My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who wanted to intimidate me.",
      "15": "The wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul.",
      "16": "When all our enemies heard this, all the surrounding nations were intimidated and lost their confidence, for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God.",
      "17": "During those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.",
      "18": "For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.",

      "3": "I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot, and let the doors be shut and securely fastened while the guards are on duty. Station the citizens of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their homes.”",

      "5": "and had prepared a large room for him where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, and the tenths of grain, new wine, and fresh oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests.",
      "6": "While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign. It was only later that I asked the king for a leave of absence",
      "7": "so I could return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God’s house.",
      "8": "I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the room.",
      "9": "I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored there, along with the grain offering and frankincense.",
      "10": "I also found out that because the portions for the Levites had not been given, each of the Levites and the singers performing the service had gone back to his own field.",
      "11": "Therefore, I rebuked the officials, asking, “Why has the house of God been neglected?” I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts.",
      "12": "Then all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and fresh oil into the storehouses.",
      "13": "I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah, the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy. They were responsible for the distribution to their colleagues.",
      "14": "Remember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services.",
      "15": "At that time I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in stores of grain and loading them on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.",
      "16": "The Tyrians living there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.",
      "17": "I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day?",
      "18": "Didn’t your ancestors do the same, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling his anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!”",
      "19": "When shadows began to fall on the city gates of Jerusalem just before the Sabbath, I gave orders that the city gates be closed and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my men at the gates, so that no goods could enter during the Sabbath day.",
      "20": "Once or twice the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,",
      "21": "but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I’ll use force against you.” After that they did not come again on the Sabbath.",
      "22": "Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the city gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.\nRemember me for this also, my God, and look on me with compassion according to the abundance of your faithful love.",
      "23": "In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.",
      "24": "Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples but could not speak Hebrew.",
      "25": "I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair. I forced them to take an oath before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or yourselves!",
      "26": "Didn’t King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin.",
      "27": "Why then should we hear about you doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”",
      "28": "Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me.",
      "29": "Remember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.",
      "30": "So I purified them from everything foreign and assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.",
      "31": "I also arranged for the donation of wood at the appointed times and for the firstfruits.\nRemember me, my God, with favor."
