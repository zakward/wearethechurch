      "1": "In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.",
      "2": "The Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them to the land of Babylon, to the house of his god, and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.",
      "3": "The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and from the nobility—",
      "4": "young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom, knowledgeable, perceptive, and capable of serving in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the Chaldean language and literature.",
      "5": "The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to attend the king.",
      "6": "Among them, from the Judahites, were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",
      "7": "The chief eunuch gave them names; he gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel, Shadrach to Hananiah, Meshach to Mishael, and Abednego to Azariah.",
      "8": "Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or with the wine he drank. So he asked permission from the chief eunuch not to defile himself.",
      "9": "God had granted Daniel kindness and compassion from the chief eunuch,",
      "10": "yet he said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and drink. What if he sees your faces looking thinner than the other young men your age? You would endanger my life with the king.”",
      "11": "So Daniel said to the guard whom the chief eunuch had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
      "12": "“Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
      "13": "Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king’s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.”",
      "14": "He agreed with them about this and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of ten days they looked better and healthier than all the young men who were eating the king’s food.",
      "16": "So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.",
      "17": "God gave these four young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams of every kind.",
      "18": "At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief eunuch presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to attend the king.",
      "20": "In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and mediums in his entire kingdom.",
      "21": "Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled him, and sleep deserted him.",
      "2": "So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, mediums, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king,",
      "3": "he said to them, “I have had a dream and am anxious to understand it.”",
      "4": "The Chaldeans spoke to the king (Aramaic begins here): “May the king live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”",
      "5": "The king replied to the Chaldeans, “My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump.",
      "6": "But if you make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you’ll receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me. So make the dream and its interpretation known to me.”",
      "7": "They answered a second time, “May the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will make known the interpretation.”",
      "8": "The king replied, “I know for certain you are trying to gain some time, because you see that my word is final.",
      "9": "If you don’t tell me the dream, there is one decree for you. You have conspired to tell me something false or fraudulent until the situation changes. So tell me the dream and I will know you can give me its interpretation.”",
      "10": "The Chaldeans answered the king, “No one on earth can make known what the king requests. Consequently, no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, medium, or Chaldean.",
      "11": "What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”",
      "12": "Because of this, the king became violently angry and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "13": "The decree was issued that the wise men were to be executed, and they searched for Daniel and his friends, to execute them.",
      "14": "Then Daniel responded with tact and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.",
      "15": "He asked Arioch, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” Then Arioch explained the situation to Daniel.",
      "16": "So Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give the king the interpretation.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter,",
      "18": "urging them to ask the God of the heavens for mercy concerning this mystery, so Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of Babylon’s wise men.",
      "19": "The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of the heavens",
      "20": "and declared:\nMay the name of God\nbe praised forever and ever,\nfor wisdom and power belong to him.",
      "21": "He changes the times and seasons;\nhe removes kings and establishes kings.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\nand knowledge to those\nwho have understanding.",
      "22": "He reveals the deep and hidden things;\nhe knows what is in the darkness,\nand light dwells with him.",
      "23": "I offer thanks and praise to you,\nGod of my ancestors,\nbecause you have given me\nwisdom and power.\nAnd now you have let me know\nwhat we asked of you,\nfor you have let us know\nthe king’s mystery.",
      "24": "Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had assigned to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He came and said to him, “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.”",
      "25": "Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the Judean exiles who can let the king know the interpretation.”",
      "26": "The king said in reply to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream I had and its interpretation?”",
      "27": "Daniel answered the king, “No wise man, medium, magician, or diviner is able to make known to the king the mystery he asked about.",
      "28": "But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will happen in the last days. Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay in bed were these:",
      "29": "Your Majesty, while you were in your bed, thoughts came to your mind about what will happen in the future. The revealer of mysteries has let you know what will happen.",
      "30": "As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.",
      "31": "“Your Majesty, as you were watching, suddenly a colossal statue appeared. That statue, tall and dazzling, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying.",
      "32": "The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze,",
      "33": "its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay.",
      "34": "As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it, struck the statue on its feet of iron and fired clay, and crushed them.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",
      "36": "“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.",
      "37": "Your Majesty, you are king of kings. The God of the heavens has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory.",
      "38": "Wherever people live—or wild animals, or birds of the sky—he has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "“After you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth.",
      "40": "A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; for iron crushes and shatters everything, and like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all the others.",
      "41": "You saw the feet and toes, partly of a potter’s fired clay and partly of iron—it will be a divided kingdom, though some of the strength of iron will be in it. You saw the iron mixed with clay,",
      "42": "and that the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly fired clay—part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle.",
      "43": "You saw the iron mixed with clay—the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay.",
      "44": "“In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever.",
      "45": "You saw a stone break off from the mountain without a hand touching it, and it crushed the iron, bronze, fired clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told the king what will happen in the future. The dream is certain, and its interpretation reliable.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown, worshiped Daniel, and gave orders to present an offering and incense to him.",
      "47": "The king said to Daniel, “Your God is indeed God of gods, Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, since you were able to reveal this mystery.”",
      "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue, ninety feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "3": "So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "4": "A herald loudly proclaimed, “People of every nation and language, you are commanded:",
      "5": "When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, you are to fall facedown and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.",
      "6": "But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.”",
      "7": "Therefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "Some Chaldeans took this occasion to come forward and maliciously accuse the Jews.",
      "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever.",
      "10": "You as king have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music must fall down and worship the gold statue.",
      "11": "Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.",
      "12": "There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men have ignored you, the king; they do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”",
      "13": "Then in a furious rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don’t serve my gods or worship the gold statue I have set up?",
      "15": "Now if you’re ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don’t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire—and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we don’t need to give you an answer to this question.",
      "17": "If the God we serve exists, then he can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he can rescue us from the power of you, the king.",
      "18": "But even if he does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up.”",
      "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than was customary,",
      "20": "and he commanded some of the best soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "21": "So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings, and other clothes, were tied up and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "22": "Since the king’s command was so urgent and the furnace extremely hot, the raging flames killed those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.",
      "23": "And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm. He said to his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men, bound, into the fire?”\n“Yes, of course, Your Majesty,” they replied to the king.",
      "25": "He exclaimed, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”",
      "26": "Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God—come out!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.",
      "27": "When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king’s advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men: not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and rescued his servants who trusted in him. They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.",
      "29": "Therefore I issue a decree that anyone of any people, nation, or language who says anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb and his house made a garbage dump. For there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”",
      "30": "Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."

      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar,\nTo those of every people, nation, and language, who live on the whole earth:\nMay your prosperity increase.",

      "3": "How great are his miracles,\nand how mighty his wonders!\nHis kingdom is an eternal kingdom,\nand his dominion is from generation to generation.",
      "4": "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.",
      "5": "I had a dream, and it frightened me; while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.",
      "6": "So I issued a decree to bring all the wise men of Babylon to me in order that they might make the dream’s interpretation known to me.",
      "7": "When the magicians, mediums, Chaldeans, and diviners came in, I told them the dream, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.",
      "8": "Finally Daniel, named Belteshazzar after the name of my god—and a spirit of the holy gods is in him—came before me. I told him the dream:",
      "9": "“Belteshazzar, head of the magicians, because I know that you have the spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery puzzles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation.",
      "10": "In the visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this:\nThere was a tree in the middle of the earth,\nand it was very tall.",
      "11": "The tree grew large and strong;\nits top reached to the sky,\nand it was visible to the ends of the earth.",
      "12": "Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant,\nand on it was food for all.\nWild animals found shelter under it,\nthe birds of the sky lived in its branches,\nand every creature was fed from it.",
      "13": "“As I was lying in my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven.",
      "14": "He called out loudly:\nCut down the tree and chop off its branches;\nstrip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.\nLet the animals flee from under it,\nand the birds from its branches.",
      "15": "But leave the stump with its roots in the ground\nand with a band of iron and bronze around it\nin the tender grass of the field.\nLet him be drenched with dew from the sky\nand share the plants of the earth\nwith the animals.",
      "16": "Let his mind be changed from that of a human,\nand let him be given the mind of an animal\nfor seven periods of time.",
      "17": "This word is by decree of the watchers,\nand the decision is by command from the holy ones.\nThis is so that the living will know\nthat the Most High is ruler\nover human kingdoms.\nHe gives them to anyone he wants\nand sets the lowliest of people over them.",
      "18": "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can make the interpretation known to me. But you can, because you have a spirit of the holy gods.”",
      "19": "Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.”\nBelteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!",
      "20": "The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky and was visible to the whole earth,",
      "21": "and whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant—and on it was food for all, under it the wild animals lived, and in its branches the birds of the sky lived—",
      "22": "that tree is you, Your Majesty. For you have become great and strong: your greatness has grown and even reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.",
      "23": "“The king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze around it in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky and share food with the wild animals for seven periods of time.’",
      "24": "This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree of the Most High that has been issued against my lord the king:",
      "25": "You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like cattle and be drenched with dew from the sky for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.",
      "26": "As for the command to leave the tree’s stump with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules.",
      "27": "Therefore, may my advice seem good to you my king. Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right, and from your injustices by showing mercy to the needy. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.”",
      "28": "All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "29": "At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon,",
      "30": "the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built to be a royal residence by my vast power and for my majestic glory?”",
      "31": "While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you.",
      "32": "You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.”",
      "33": "At that moment the message against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.",
      "34": "But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever:\nFor his dominion is an everlasting dominion,\nand his kingdom is from generation to generation.",
      "35": "All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing,\nand he does what he wants with the army of heaven\nand the inhabitants of the earth.\nThere is no one who can block his hand\nor say to him, “What have you done?”",
      "36": "At that time my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and my nobles sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and even more greatness came to me.",
      "37": "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of the heavens, because all his works are true and his ways are just. He is able to humble those who walk in pride."

In the days of your predecessor he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods.

      "22": "“But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this.",
      "23": "Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens. The vessels from his house were brought to you, and as you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them, you praised the gods made of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or understand. But you have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life.",

      "24": "The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions’ den—they, their children, and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.",
