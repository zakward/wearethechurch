      "1": "Paul, called as an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and Sosthenes our brother:",
      "2": "To the church of God at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord—both their Lord and ours.",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,",
      "5": "that you were enriched in him in every way, in all speech and all knowledge.",
      "6": "In this way, the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,",
      "7": "so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful; you were called by him into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree in what you say, that there be no divisions among you, and that you be united with the same understanding and the same conviction.",
      "11": "For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers and sisters, by members of Chloe’s people, that there is rivalry among you.",
      "12": "What I am saying is this: One of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”",
      "13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul’s name?",
      "14": "I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.",
      "16": "I did, in fact, baptize the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t recall if I baptized anyone else.",
      "17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ will not be emptied of its effect.",
      "18": "For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God to us who are being saved.",
      "19": "For it is written,\nI will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\nand I will set aside the intelligence of the intelligent.",
      "20": "Where is the one who is wise? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn’t God made the world’s wisdom foolish?",
      "21": "For since, in God’s wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of what is preached.",
      "22": "For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks seek wisdom,",
      "23": "but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.",
      "24": "Yet to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God,",
      "25": "because God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.",
      "26": "Brothers and sisters, consider your calling: Not many were wise from a human perspective, not many powerful, not many of noble birth.",
      "27": "Instead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the strong.",
      "28": "God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in the world—what is viewed as nothing—to bring to nothing what is viewed as something,",
      "29": "so that no one may boast in his presence.",
      "30": "It is from him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom from God for us—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption—",
      "31": "in order that, as it is written: Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."

      "3": "I came to you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.",
      "4": "My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,",
      "5": "so that your faith might not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.",
      "6": "We do, however, speak a wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.",
      "7": "On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined before the ages for our glory.",
      "8": "None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, because if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
      "9": "But as it is written,\nWhat no eye has seen, no ear has heard,\nand no human heart has conceived—\nGod has prepared these things for those who love him.",
      "10": "Now God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, since the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.",
      "11": "For who knows a person’s thoughts except his spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.",
      "13": "We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.",
      "14": "But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually.",
      "15": "The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, and yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone.",
      "16": "For\nwho has known the Lord’s mind,\nthat he may instruct him?\nBut we have the mind of Christ."

      "2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready,",
      "3": "because you are still worldly. For since there is envy and strife among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans?",
      "4": "For whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not acting like mere humans?",
      "5": "What then is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.",
      "7": "So, then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.",
      "8": "Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
      "9": "For we are God’s coworkers. You are God’s field, God’s building.",
      "10": "According to God’s grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, and another builds on it. But each one is to be careful how he builds on it.",
      "11": "For no one can lay any foundation other than what has been laid down. That foundation is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
      "13": "each one’s work will become obvious. For the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one’s work.",
      "14": "If anyone’s work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward.",
      "15": "If anyone’s work is burned up, he will experience loss, but he himself will be saved—but only as through fire.",
      "16": "Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and that is what you are.",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he can become wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written, He catches the wise in their craftiness;",
      "20": "and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile.",
      "21": "So let no one boast in human leaders, for everything is yours—",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come—everything is yours,",
      "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."

      "1": "A person should think of us in this way: as servants of Christ and managers of the mysteries of God.",
      "2": "In this regard, it is required that managers be found faithful.",
      "3": "It is of little importance to me that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I don’t even judge myself.",
      "4": "For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this. It is the Lord who judges me.",
      "5": "So don’t judge anything prematurely, before the Lord comes, who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God.",
      "6": "Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying: “Nothing beyond what is written.” The purpose is that none of you will be arrogant, favoring one person over another.",
      "7": "For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you didn’t receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn’t received it?",
      "8": "You are already full! You are already rich! You have begun to reign as kings without us—and I wish you did reign, so that we could also reign with you!",
      "9": "For I think God has displayed us, the apostles, in last place, like men condemned to die: We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people.",
      "10": "We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!",
      "11": "Up to the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, homeless;",
      "12": "we labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;",
      "13": "when we are slandered, we respond graciously. Even now, we are like the scum of the earth, like everyone’s garbage.",
      "14": "I’m not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.",
      "15": "For you may have countless instructors in Christ, but you don’t have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.",
      "16": "Therefore I urge you to imitate me.",
      "17": "This is why I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dearly loved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you about my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "Now some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.",
      "19": "But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk, but the power of those who are arrogant.",
      "20": "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.",
      "21": "What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"

      "2": "And you are arrogant! Shouldn’t you be filled with grief and remove from your congregation the one who did this?",
      "3": "Even though I am absent in the body, I am present in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who has been doing such a thing.",
      "4": "When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,",
      "5": "hand that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.",
      "6": "Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?",
      "7": "Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new unleavened batch, as indeed you are. For Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.",
      "8": "Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old leaven or with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "9": "I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.",
      "10": "I did not mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters; otherwise you would have to leave the world.",
      "11": "But actually, I wrote you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister and is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or verbally abusive, a drunkard or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.",
      "12": "For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Don’t you judge those who are inside?",

      "4": "So if you have such matters, do you appoint as your judges those who have no standing in the church?",
      "5": "I say this to your shame! Can it be that there is not one wise person among you who is able to arbitrate between fellow believers?",
      "6": "Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers!",
      "7": "As it is, to have legal disputes against one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?",
      "8": "Instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat—and you do this to brothers and sisters!",
      "9": "Don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived: No sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, or males who have sex with males,",
      "10": "no thieves, greedy people, drunkards, verbally abusive people, or swindlers will inherit God’s kingdom.",

      "13": "“Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food,” and God will do away with both of them. However, the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",

      "2": "But because sexual immorality is so common, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman should have sexual relations with her own husband.",
      "3": "A husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.",
      "4": "A wife does not have the right over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband does not have the right over his own body, but his wife does.",

      "9": "But if they do not have self-control, they should marry, since it is better to marry than to burn with desire.",
      "10": "To the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord—a wife is not to leave her husband.",
      "11": "But if she does leave, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband—and a husband is not to divorce his wife.",
      "12": "But I (not the Lord) say to the rest: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.",
      "13": "Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband is made holy by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy by the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.",
      "15": "But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you to live in peace.",
      "16": "Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.",
      "17": "Let each one live his life in the situation the Lord assigned when God called him. This is what I command in all the churches.",

      "20": "Let each of you remain in the situation in which he was called.",
      "21": "Were you called while a slave? Don’t let it concern you. But if you can become free, by all means take the opportunity.",
      "22": "For he who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called as a free man is Christ’s slave.",

      "27": "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.",
      "28": "However, if you do get married, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.",
      "29": "This is what I mean, brothers and sisters: The time is limited, so from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none,",
      "30": "those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they didn’t own anything,",
      "31": "and those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away.",
      "32": "I want you to be without concerns. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord.",
      "33": "But the married man is concerned about the things of the world—how he may please his wife—",
      "34": "and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world—how she may please her husband.",
      "35": "I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but to promote what is proper and so that you may be devoted to the Lord without distraction.",
      "36": "If any man thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, if she is getting beyond the usual age for marriage, and he feels he should marry—he can do what he wants. He is not sinning; they can get married.",
      "37": "But he who stands firm in his heart (who is under no compulsion, but has control over his own will) and has decided in his heart to keep her as his fiancée, will do well.",
      "38": "So, then, he who marries his fiancée does well, but he who does not marry will do better.",
      "39": "A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to anyone she wants—only in the Lord.",

      "10": "For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t his weak conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?",
