      "14": "Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;\nthe houses of Achzib are a deception\nto the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring a conqueror\nagainst you who live in Mareshah.\nThe nobility of Israel will come to Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair\nin sorrow for your precious children;\nmake yourselves as bald as an eagle,\nfor they have been taken from you into exile."

      "8": "But recently my people have risen up\nlike an enemy:\nYou strip off the splendid robe\nfrom those who are passing through confidently,\nlike those returning from war.",
      "9": "You force the women of my people\nout of their comfortable homes,\nand you take my blessing\nfrom their children forever.",
      "10": "Get up and leave,\nfor this is not your place of rest\nbecause defilement brings destruction—\na grievous destruction!",
      "11": "If a man comes\nand utters empty lies—\n“I will preach to you about wine and beer”—\nhe would be just the preacher for this people!",
      "12": "I will indeed gather all of you, Jacob;\nI will collect the remnant of Israel.\nI will bring them together like sheep in a pen,\nlike a flock in the middle of its pasture.\nIt will be noisy with people.",

      "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord,\nbut he will not answer them.\nHe will hide his face from them at that time\nbecause of the crimes they have committed.",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says\nconcerning the prophets\nwho lead my people astray,\nwho proclaim peace\nwhen they have food to sink their teeth into\nbut declare war against the one\nwho puts nothing in their mouths.",
      "6": "Therefore, it will be night for you—\nwithout visions;\nit will grow dark for you—\nwithout divination.\nThe sun will set on these prophets,\nand the daylight will turn black over them.",
      "7": "Then the seers will be ashamed\nand the diviners disappointed.\nThey will all cover their mouths\nbecause there will be no answer from God.",
      "8": "As for me, however, I am filled with power\nby the Spirit of the Lord,\nwith justice and courage,\nto proclaim to Jacob his rebellion\nand to Israel his sin.",
