      "21": "Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.",
      "22": "When he did come out, he could not speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making signs to them and remained speechless.",

      "61": "Then they said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”",
      "62": "So they motioned to his father to find out what he wanted him to be called.",
      "63": "He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.",

      "66": "All who heard about him took it to heart, saying, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the Lord’s hand was with him.",
      "67": "Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:",
      "68": "Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nbecause he has visited\nand provided redemption for his people.",

      "23": "But they kept up the pressure, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified, and their voices won out.",
      "24": "So Pilate decided to grant their demand",
      "25": "and released the one they were asking for, who had been thrown into prison for rebellion and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.",
      "26": "As they led him away, they seized Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.",
      "27": "A large crowd of people followed him, including women who were mourning and lamenting him.",
      "28": "But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children.",
      "29": "Look, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the women without children, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!’",

      "32": "Two others—criminals—were also led away to be executed with him.",
      "33": "When they arrived at the place called The Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.",
      "34": "Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided his clothes and cast lots.",
      "35": "The people stood watching, and even the leaders were scoffing: “He saved others; let him save himself if this is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One!”",
      "36": "The soldiers also mocked him. They came offering him sour wine",
      "37": "and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”",
      "38": "An inscription was above him: This Is the King of the Jews.",
      "39": "Then one of the criminals hanging there began to yell insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”",
      "40": "But the other answered, rebuking him: “Don’t you even fear God, since you are undergoing the same punishment?",
      "41": "We are punished justly, because we’re getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.”",
      "42": "Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”",
      "43": "And he said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”",
      "44": "It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three,",

      "47": "When the centurion saw what happened, he began to glorify God, saying, “This man really was righteous!”",
      "48": "All the crowds that had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, went home, striking their chests.",
      "49": "But all who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.",
      "50": "There was a good and righteous man named Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin,",
      "51": "who had not agreed with their plan and action. He was from Arimathea, a Judean town, and was looking forward to the kingdom of God.",
      "52": "He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body.",
      "53": "Taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever been placed.",
      "54": "It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.",
      "55": "The women who had come with him from Galilee followed along and observed the tomb and how his body was placed.",
      "56": "Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment."

      "3": "They went in but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
      "4": "While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood by them in dazzling clothes.",
      "5": "So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground.\n“Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” asked the men.",
      "6": "“He is not here, but he has risen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,",
      "7": "saying, ‘It is necessary that the Son of Man be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day’?”",

      "13": "Now that same day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.",
      "14": "Together they were discussing everything that had taken place.",
      "15": "And while they were discussing and arguing, Jesus himself came near and began to walk along with them.",
      "16": "But they were prevented from recognizing him.",
      "17": "Then he asked them, “What is this dispute that you’re having with each other as you are walking?” And they stopped walking and looked discouraged.",
      "18": "The one named Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days?”",
      "19": "“What things?” he asked them.\nSo they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in action and speech before God and all the people,",
      "20": "and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him.",
      "21": "But we were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, it’s the third day since these things happened.",
      "22": "Moreover, some women from our group astounded us. They arrived early at the tomb,",
      "23": "and when they didn’t find his body, they came and reported that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.",
      "24": "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”",
      "25": "He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!",
      "26": "Wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and enter into his glory?”",

      "29": "But they urged him, “Stay with us, because it’s almost evening, and now the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.",
      "30": "It was as he reclined at the table with them that he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.",
      "31": "Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, but he disappeared from their sight.",
      "32": "They said to each other, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he was talking with us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us?”",
      "33": "That very hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the Eleven and those with them gathered together,",
      "34": "who said, “The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!”",
      "35": "Then they began to describe what had happened on the road and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.",
      "36": "As they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst. He said to them, “Peace to you!”",
      "37": "But they were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost.",
      "38": "“Why are you troubled?” he asked them. “And why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
      "39": "Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have.”",
      "40": "Having said this, he showed them his hands and feet.",
