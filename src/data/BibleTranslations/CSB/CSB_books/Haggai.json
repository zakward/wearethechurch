      "14": "Then Haggai replied, “So is this people, and so is this nation before me—this is the Lord’s declaration. And so is every work of their hands; even what they offer there is defiled.",
      "15": "“Now from this day on, think carefully: Before one stone was placed on another in the Lord’s temple,",
      "16": "what state were you in? When someone came to a grain heap of twenty measures, it only amounted to ten; when one came to the winepress to dip fifty measures from the vat, it only amounted to twenty.",
