      "3": "“If the animal you present as a burnt offering is from the herd, it must be a male with no defects. Bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle so you may be accepted by the Lord.",
      "4": "Lay your hand on the animal’s head, and the Lord will accept its death in your place to purify you, making you right with him.",

      "8": "They will arrange the pieces of the offering, including the head and fat, on the wood burning on the altar.",
      "9": "But the internal organs and the legs must first be washed with water. Then the priest will burn the entire sacrifice on the altar as a burnt offering. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.",
