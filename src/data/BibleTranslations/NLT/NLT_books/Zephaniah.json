      "5": "For they go up to their roofs\n    and bow down to the sun, moon, and stars.\nThey claim to follow the Lord,\n    but then they worship Molech, too.",

      "3": "Seek the Lord, all who are humble,\n    and follow his commands.\nSeek to do what is right\n    and to live humbly.\nPerhaps even yet the Lord will protect you—\n    protect you from his anger on that day of destruction.",
      "4": "Gaza and Ashkelon will be abandoned,\n    Ashdod and Ekron torn down.",

      "10": "They will receive the wages of their pride,\n    for they have scoffed at the people of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.",
      "11": "The Lord will terrify them\n    as he destroys all the gods in the land.\nThen nations around the world will worship the Lord,\n    each in their own land.",
      "12": "“You Ethiopians will also be slaughtered\n    by my sword,” says the Lord.",

      "14": "The proud city will become a pasture for flocks and herds,\n    and all sorts of wild animals will settle there.\nThe desert owl and screech owl will roost on its ruined columns,\n    their calls echoing through the gaping windows.\nRubble will block all the doorways,\n    and the cedar paneling will be exposed to the weather.",
      "15": "This is the boisterous city,\n    once so secure.\n“I am the greatest!” it boasted.\n    “No other city can compare with me!”\nBut now, look how it has become an utter ruin,\n    a haven for wild animals.\nEveryone passing by will laugh in derision\n    and shake a defiant fist."

      "4": "Its prophets are arrogant liars seeking their own gain.\n    Its priests defile the Temple by disobeying God’s instructions.",
      "5": "But the Lord is still there in the city,\n    and he does no wrong.\nDay by day he hands down justice,\n    and he does not fail.\n    But the wicked know no shame.",
      "6": "“I have wiped out many nations,\n    devastating their fortress walls and towers.\nTheir streets are now deserted;\n    their cities lie in silent ruin.\nThere are no survivors—\n    none at all.",
      "7": "I thought, ‘Surely they will have reverence for me now!\n    Surely they will listen to my warnings.\nThen I won’t need to strike again,\n    destroying their homes.’\nBut no, they get up early\n    to continue their evil deeds.",
      "8": "Therefore, be patient,” says the Lord.\n    “Soon I will stand and accuse these evil nations.\nFor I have decided to gather the kingdoms of the earth\n    and pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them.\nAll the earth will be devoured\n    by the fire of my jealousy.",
