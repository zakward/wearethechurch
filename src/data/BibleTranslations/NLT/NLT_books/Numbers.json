      "19": "And it won’t be for just a day or two, or for five or ten or even twenty.",
      "20": "You will eat it for a whole month until you gag and are sick of it. For you have rejected the Lord, who is here among you, and you have whined to him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”",

      "25": "And the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses. Then he gave the seventy elders the same Spirit that was upon Moses. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But this never happened again.",
      "26": "Two men, Eldad and Medad, had stayed behind in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but they had not gone out to the Tabernacle. Yet the Spirit rested upon them as well, so they prophesied there in the camp.",
      "27": "A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”",
      "28": "Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ assistant since his youth, protested, “Moses, my master, make them stop!”",
      "29": "But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them all!”",
      "30": "Then Moses returned to the camp with the elders of Israel.",
      "31": "Now the Lord sent a wind that brought quail from the sea and let them fall all around the camp. For miles in every direction there were quail flying about three feet above the ground.",
      "32": "So the people went out and caught quail all that day and throughout the night and all the next day, too. No one gathered less than fifty bushels! They spread the quail all around the camp to dry.",
      "33": "But while they were gorging themselves on the meat—while it was still in their mouths—the anger of the Lord blazed against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.",
