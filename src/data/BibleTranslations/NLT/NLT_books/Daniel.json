      "1": "During the third year of King Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.",
      "2": "The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim of Judah and permitted him to take some of the sacred objects from the Temple of God. So Nebuchadnezzar took them back to the land of Babylonia and placed them in the treasure-house of his god.",
      "3": "Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families, who had been brought to Babylon as captives.",
      "4": "“Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. “Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.”",
      "5": "The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service.",
      "6": "Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah.",
      "7": "The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names:\nDaniel was called Belteshazzar.\nHananiah was called Shadrach.\nMishael was called Meshach.\nAzariah was called Abednego.",
      "8": "But Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods.",
      "9": "Now God had given the chief of staff both respect and affection for Daniel.",
      "10": "But he responded, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has ordered that you eat this food and wine. If you become pale and thin compared to the other youths your age, I am afraid the king will have me beheaded.”",
      "11": "Daniel spoke with the attendant who had been appointed by the chief of staff to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",
      "12": "“Please test us for ten days on a diet of vegetables and water,” Daniel said.",
      "13": "“At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young men who are eating the king’s food. Then make your decision in light of what you see.”",
      "14": "The attendant agreed to Daniel’s suggestion and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned by the king.",
      "16": "So after that, the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the food and wine provided for the others.",
      "17": "God gave these four young men an unusual aptitude for understanding every aspect of literature and wisdom. And God gave Daniel the special ability to interpret the meanings of visions and dreams.",
      "18": "When the training period ordered by the king was completed, the chief of staff brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "The king talked with them, and no one impressed him as much as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the royal service.",
      "20": "Whenever the king consulted them in any matter requiring wisdom and balanced judgment, he found them ten times more capable than any of the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.",
      "21": "Daniel remained in the royal service until the first year of the reign of King Cyrus."

    "2": {
      "1": "One night during the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams that he couldn’t sleep.",
      "2": "He called in his magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers, and he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed. As they stood before the king,",
      "3": "he said, “I have had a dream that deeply troubles me, and I must know what it means.”",
      "4": "Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, “Long live the king! Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.”",
      "5": "But the king said to the astrologers, “I am serious about this. If you don’t tell me what my dream was and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into heaps of rubble!",
      "6": "But if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means, I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors. Just tell me the dream and what it means!”",
      "7": "They said again, “Please, Your Majesty. Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.”",
      "8": "The king replied, “I know what you are doing! You’re stalling for time because you know I am serious when I say,",
      "9": "‘If you don’t tell me the dream, you are doomed.’ So you have conspired to tell me lies, hoping I will change my mind. But tell me the dream, and then I’ll know that you can tell me what it means.”",
      "10": "The astrologers replied to the king, “No one on earth can tell the king his dream! And no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer!",
      "11": "The king’s demand is impossible. No one except the gods can tell you your dream, and they do not live here among people.”",
      "12": "The king was furious when he heard this, and he ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be executed.",
      "13": "And because of the king’s decree, men were sent to find and kill Daniel and his friends.",
      "14": "When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, came to kill them, Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion.",
      "15": "He asked Arioch, “Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?” So Arioch told him all that had happened.",
      "16": "Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the king what the dream meant.",
      "17": "Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened.",
      "18": "He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret, so they would not be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven.",
      "20": "He said, \n“Praise the name of God forever and ever,\n    for he has all wisdom and power.",
      "21": "He controls the course of world events;\n    he removes kings and sets up other kings.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\n    and knowledge to the scholars.",
      "22": "He reveals deep and mysterious things\n    and knows what lies hidden in darkness,\n    though he is surrounded by light.",
      "23": "I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors,\n    for you have given me wisdom and strength.\nYou have told me what we asked of you\n    and revealed to us what the king demanded.”",
      "24": "Then Daniel went in to see Arioch, whom the king had ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning of his dream.”",
      "25": "Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said, “I have found one of the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream!”",
      "26": "The king said to Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar), “Is this true? Can you tell me what my dream was and what it means?”",
      "27": "Daniel replied, “There are no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or fortune-tellers who can reveal the king’s secret.",
      "28": "But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you your dream and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed.",
      "29": "“While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about coming events. He who reveals secrets has shown you what is going to happen.",
      "30": "And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else that I know the secret of your dream, but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart.",
      "31": "“In your vision, Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge, shining statue of a man. It was a frightening sight.",
      "32": "The head of the statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze,",
      "33": "its legs were iron, and its feet were a combination of iron and baked clay.",
      "34": "As you watched, a rock was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands. It struck the feet of iron and clay, smashing them to bits.",
      "35": "The whole statue was crushed into small pieces of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. Then the wind blew them away without a trace, like chaff on a threshing floor. But the rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth.",
      "36": "“That was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means.",
      "37": "Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.",
      "38": "He has made you the ruler over all the inhabited world and has put even the wild animals and birds under your control. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "“But after your kingdom comes to an end, another kingdom, inferior to yours, will rise to take your place. After that kingdom has fallen, yet a third kingdom, represented by bronze, will rise to rule the world.",
      "40": "Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one, as strong as iron. That kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires, just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes.",
      "41": "The feet and toes you saw were a combination of iron and baked clay, showing that this kingdom will be divided. Like iron mixed with clay, it will have some of the strength of iron.",
      "42": "But while some parts of it will be as strong as iron, other parts will be as weak as clay.",
      "43": "This mixture of iron and clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage. But they will not hold together, just as iron and clay do not mix.",
      "44": "“During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or conquered. It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness, and it will stand forever.",
      "45": "That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain, though not by human hands, that crushed to pieces the statue of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God was showing the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its meaning is certain.”",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar threw himself down before Daniel and worshiped him, and he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him.",
      "47": "The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings, a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this secret.”",
      "48": "Then the king appointed Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable gifts. He made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon, as well as chief over all his wise men.",
      "49": "At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the king’s court."

    "3": {
      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "Then he sent messages to the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up.",
      "3": "So all these officials came and stood before the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "4": "Then a herald shouted out, “People of all races and nations and languages, listen to the king’s command!",
      "5": "When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments, bow to the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s gold statue.",
      "6": "Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”",
      "7": "So at the sound of the musical instruments, all the people, whatever their race or nation or language, bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "But some of the astrologers went to the king and informed on the Jews.",
      "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Long live the king!",
      "10": "You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments.",
      "11": "That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into a blazing furnace.",
      "12": "But there are some Jews—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—whom you have put in charge of the province of Babylon. They pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up.”",
      "13": "Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him. When they were brought in,",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up?",
      "15": "I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments. But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace. And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power?”",
      "16": "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you.",
      "17": "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty.",
      "18": "But even if he doesn’t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”",
      "19": "Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual.",
      "20": "Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.",
      "21": "So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace, fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes, and other garments.",
      "22": "And because the king, in his anger, had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace, the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in.",
      "23": "So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied, fell into the roaring flames.",
      "24": "But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisers, “Didn’t we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace?”\n“Yes, Your Majesty, we certainly did,” they replied.",
      "25": "“Look!” Nebuchadnezzar shouted. “I see four men, unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god!”",
      "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!”\nSo Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire.",
      "27": "Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn’t even smell of smoke!",
      "28": "Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king’s command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.",
      "29": "Therefore, I make this decree: If any people, whatever their race or nation or language, speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb, and their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue like this!”",

During Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, this man was found to have insight, understanding, and wisdom like that of the gods.

You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all.

Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions.",

      "21": "Daniel answered, “Long live the king!",
      "22": "My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.”",
      "23": "The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.",
      "24": "Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit the floor of the den.",
      "25": "Then King Darius sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world:\n“Peace and prosperity to you!",
      "26": "“I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with fear before the God of Daniel.\nFor he is the living God,\n    and he will endure forever.\nHis kingdom will never be destroyed,\n    and his rule will never end.",

      "5": "Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard a voice saying to it, “Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!”",
      "6": "Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard. It had four bird’s wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority was given to this beast.",
      "7": "Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast—terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns.",
      "8": "As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.",
      "9": "I watched as thrones were put in place\n    and the Ancient One sat down to judge.\nHis clothing was as white as snow,\n    his hair like purest wool.\nHe sat on a fiery throne\n    with wheels of blazing fire,",
      "10": "and a river of fire was pouring out,\n    flowing from his presence.\nMillions of angels ministered to him;\n    many millions stood to attend him.\nThen the court began its session,\n    and the books were opened.",

      "13": "As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence.",
      "14": "He was given authority, honor, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal—it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.",
      "15": "I, Daniel, was troubled by all I had seen, and my visions terrified me.",

      "20": "I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast’s head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns. This horn had seemed greater than the others, and it had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.",
      "21": "As I watched, this horn was waging war against God’s holy people and was defeating them,",
      "22": "until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.",
      "23": "Then he said to me, “This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path.",

      "8": "The goat became very powerful. But at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off. In the large horn’s place grew four prominent horns pointing in the four directions of the earth.",
      "9": "Then from one of the prominent horns came a small horn whose power grew very great. It extended toward the south and the east and toward the glorious land of Israel.",
      "10": "Its power reached to the heavens, where it attacked the heavenly army, throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and trampling them.",
      "11": "It even challenged the Commander of heaven’s army by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple.",
      "12": "The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion. So the daily sacrifice was halted, and truth was overthrown. The horn succeeded in everything it did.",
      "13": "Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the events of this vision last? How long will the rebellion that causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices? How long will the Temple and heaven’s army be trampled on?”",

      "23": "“At the end of their rule, when their sin is at its height, a fierce king, a master of intrigue, will rise to power.",
