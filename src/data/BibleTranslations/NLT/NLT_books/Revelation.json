    "1": {
      "1": "This is a revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the events that must soon take place. He sent an angel to present this revelation to his servant John,",
      "2": "who faithfully reported everything he saw. This is his report of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.",
      "3": "God blesses the one who reads the words of this prophecy to the church, and he blesses all who listen to its message and obey what it says, for the time is near.",
      "4": "This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia.\nGrace and peace to you from the one who is, who always was, and who is still to come; from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne;",
      "5": "and from Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness to these things, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of all the kings of the world.\nAll glory to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by shedding his blood for us.",
      "6": "He has made us a Kingdom of priests for God his Father. All glory and power to him forever and ever! Amen.",
      "7": "Look! He comes with the clouds of heaven.\n    And everyone will see him—\n    even those who pierced him.\nAnd all the nations of the world\n    will mourn for him.\nYes! Amen!",
      "8": "“I am the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end,” says the Lord God. “I am the one who is, who always was, and who is still to come—the Almighty One.”",
      "9": "I, John, am your brother and your partner in suffering and in God’s Kingdom and in the patient endurance to which Jesus calls us. I was exiled to the island of Patmos for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus.",
      "10": "It was the Lord’s Day, and I was worshiping in the Spirit. Suddenly, I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet blast.",
      "11": "It said, “Write in a book everything you see, and send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”",
      "12": "When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands.",
      "13": "And standing in the middle of the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest.",
      "14": "His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire.",
      "15": "His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves.",
      "16": "He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth. And his face was like the sun in all its brilliance.",
      "17": "When I saw him, I fell at his feet as if I were dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid! I am the First and the Last.",
      "18": "I am the living one. I died, but look—I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave.",
      "19": "“Write down what you have seen—both the things that are now happening and the things that will happen.",
      "20": "This is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Ephesus. This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands:",
      "2": "“I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people. You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. You have discovered they are liars.",
      "3": "You have patiently suffered for me without quitting.",
      "4": "“But I have this complaint against you. You don’t love me or each other as you did at first!",
      "5": "Look how far you have fallen! Turn back to me and do the works you did at first. If you don’t repent, I will come and remove your lampstand from its place among the churches.",
      "6": "But this is in your favor: You hate the evil deeds of the Nicolaitans, just as I do.",
      "7": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give fruit from the tree of life in the paradise of God.",
      "8": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Smyrna. This is the message from the one who is the First and the Last, who was dead but is now alive:",
      "9": "“I know about your suffering and your poverty—but you are rich! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan.",
      "10": "Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you. You will suffer for ten days. But if you remain faithful even when facing death, I will give you the crown of life.",
      "11": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death.",
      "12": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Pergamum. This is the message from the one with the sharp two-edged sword:",
      "13": "“I know that you live in the city where Satan has his throne, yet you have remained loyal to me. You refused to deny me even when Antipas, my faithful witness, was martyred among you there in Satan’s city.",
      "14": "“But I have a few complaints against you. You tolerate some among you whose teaching is like that of Balaam, who showed Balak how to trip up the people of Israel. He taught them to sin by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sin.",
      "15": "In a similar way, you have some Nicolaitans among you who follow the same teaching.",
      "16": "Repent of your sin, or I will come to you suddenly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.",
      "17": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give some of the manna that has been hidden away in heaven. And I will give to each one a white stone, and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one understands except the one who receives it.",
      "18": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira. This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like flames of fire, whose feet are like polished bronze:",
      "19": "“I know all the things you do. I have seen your love, your faith, your service, and your patient endurance. And I can see your constant improvement in all these things.",
      "20": "“But I have this complaint against you. You are permitting that woman—that Jezebel who calls herself a prophet—to lead my servants astray. She teaches them to commit sexual sin and to eat food offered to idols.",
      "21": "I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to turn away from her immorality.",
      "22": "“Therefore, I will throw her on a bed of suffering, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds.",
      "23": "I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches out the thoughts and intentions of every person. And I will give to each of you whatever you deserve.",
      "24": "“But I also have a message for the rest of you in Thyatira who have not followed this false teaching (‘deeper truths,’ as they call them—depths of Satan, actually). I will ask nothing more of you",
      "25": "except that you hold tightly to what you have until I come.",
      "26": "To all who are victorious, who obey me to the very end,\nTo them I will give authority over all the nations.",
      "27": "They will rule the nations with an iron rod\n    and smash them like clay pots.",
      "28": "They will have the same authority I received from my Father, and I will also give them the morning star!",
      "29": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches."

    "3": {
      "1": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Sardis. This is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars:\n“I know all the things you do, and that you have a reputation for being alive—but you are dead.",
      "2": "Wake up! Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is almost dead. I find that your actions do not meet the requirements of my God.",
      "3": "Go back to what you heard and believed at first; hold to it firmly. Repent and turn to me again. If you don’t wake up, I will come to you suddenly, as unexpected as a thief.",
      "4": "“Yet there are some in the church in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes with evil. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.",
      "5": "All who are victorious will be clothed in white. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life, but I will announce before my Father and his angels that they are mine.",
      "6": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.",
      "7": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Philadelphia.\nThis is the message from the one who is holy and true,\n    the one who has the key of David.\nWhat he opens, no one can close;\n    and what he closes, no one can open:",
      "8": "“I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close. You have little strength, yet you obeyed my word and did not deny me.",
      "9": "Look, I will force those who belong to Satan’s synagogue—those liars who say they are Jews but are not—to come and bow down at your feet. They will acknowledge that you are the ones I love.",
      "10": "“Because you have obeyed my command to persevere, I will protect you from the great time of testing that will come upon the whole world to test those who belong to this world.",
      "11": "I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take away your crown.",
      "12": "All who are victorious will become pillars in the Temple of my God, and they will never have to leave it. And I will write on them the name of my God, and they will be citizens in the city of my God—the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God. And I will also write on them my new name.",
      "13": "“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.",
      "14": "“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Laodicea. This is the message from the one who is the Amen—the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God’s new creation:",
      "15": "“I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other!",
      "16": "But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth!",
      "17": "You say, ‘I am rich. I have everything I want. I don’t need a thing!’ And you don’t realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.",
      "18": "So I advise you to buy gold from me—gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich. Also buy white garments from me so you will not be shamed by your nakedness, and ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.",
      "19": "I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference.",
      "20": "“Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.",
      "21": "Those who are victorious will sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne.",

      "2": "And instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven and someone sitting on it.",
      "3": "The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones—like jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow.",
      "4": "Twenty-four thrones surrounded him, and twenty-four elders sat on them. They were all clothed in white and had gold crowns on their heads.",
      "5": "From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder. And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames. This is the sevenfold Spirit of God.",
      "6": "In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal.\nIn the center and around the throne were four living beings, each covered with eyes, front and back.",
      "7": "The first of these living beings was like a lion; the second was like an ox; the third had a human face; and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.",
      "8": "Each of these living beings had six wings, and their wings were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day after day and night after night they keep on saying,\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty—\n    the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come.”",
      "9": "Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever),",
      "10": "the twenty-four elders fall down and worship the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever). And they lay their crowns before the throne and say,",

      "1": "Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who was sitting on the throne. There was writing on the inside and the outside of the scroll, and it was sealed with seven seals.",
      "2": "And I saw a strong angel, who shouted with a loud voice: “Who is worthy to break the seals on this scroll and open it?”",
      "3": "But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll and read it.",
      "4": "Then I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll and read it.",
      "5": "But one of the twenty-four elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David’s throne, has won the victory. He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals.”",
      "6": "Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been slaughtered, but it was now standing between the throne and the four living beings and among the twenty-four elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the sevenfold Spirit of God that is sent out into every part of the earth.",
      "7": "He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.",
      "8": "And when he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God’s people.",
      "9": "And they sang a new song with these words:\n“You are worthy to take the scroll\n    and break its seals and open it.\nFor you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God\n    from every tribe and language and people and nation.",
      "10": "And you have caused them to become\n    a Kingdom of priests for our God.\n    And they will reign on the earth.”",
      "11": "Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders.",
      "12": "And they sang in a mighty chorus:\n“Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered—\n    to receive power and riches\nand wisdom and strength\n    and honor and glory and blessing.”",
      "13": "And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang:\n“Blessing and honor and glory and power\n    belong to the one sitting on the throne\n    and to the Lamb forever and ever.”",
      "14": "And the four living beings said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the Lamb."

    "6": {
      "1": "As I watched, the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals on the scroll. Then I heard one of the four living beings say with a voice like thunder, “Come!”",
      "2": "I looked up and saw a white horse standing there. Its rider carried a bow, and a crown was placed on his head. He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory.",
      "3": "When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, “Come!”",
      "4": "Then another horse appeared, a red one. Its rider was given a mighty sword and the authority to take peace from the earth. And there was war and slaughter everywhere.",
      "5": "When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, “Come!” I looked up and saw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.",
      "6": "And I heard a voice from among the four living beings say, “A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay. And don’t waste the olive oil and wine.”",
      "7": "When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living being say, “Come!”",
      "8": "I looked up and saw a horse whose color was pale green. Its rider was named Death, and his companion was the Grave. These two were given authority over one-fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and famine and disease and wild animals.",
      "9": "When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of all who had been martyred for the word of God and for being faithful in their testimony.",
      "10": "They shouted to the Lord and said, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you judge the people who belong to this world and avenge our blood for what they have done to us?”",
      "11": "Then a white robe was given to each of them. And they were told to rest a little longer until the full number of their brothers and sisters—their fellow servants of Jesus who were to be martyred—had joined them.",
      "12": "I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as dark as black cloth, and the moon became as red as blood.",
      "13": "Then the stars of the sky fell to the earth like green figs falling from a tree shaken by a strong wind.",
      "14": "The sky was rolled up like a scroll, and all of the mountains and islands were moved from their places.",
      "15": "Then everyone—the kings of the earth, the rulers, the generals, the wealthy, the powerful, and every slave and free person—all hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.",
      "16": "And they cried to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.",
      "17": "For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to survive?”"

    "7": {
      "1": "Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so they did not blow on the earth or the sea, or even on any tree.",
      "2": "And I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. And he shouted to those four angels, who had been given power to harm land and sea,",
      "3": "“Wait! Don’t harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have placed the seal of God on the foreheads of his servants.”",
      "4": "And I heard how many were marked with the seal of God—144,000 were sealed from all the tribes of Israel:",

      "10": "And they were shouting with a great roar,\n“Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne\n    and from the Lamb!”",
      "11": "And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God.",
      "12": "They sang,\n“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom\n    and thanksgiving and honor\nand power and strength belong to our God\n    forever and ever! Amen.”",

      "4": "The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of God’s holy people, ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out.",
      "5": "Then the angel filled the incense burner with fire from the altar and threw it down upon the earth; and thunder crashed, lightning flashed, and there was a terrible earthquake.",
      "6": "Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their mighty blasts.",
      "7": "The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. One-third of the earth was set on fire, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.",

      "5": "They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting.",
      "6": "In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!",

      "18": "One-third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues—by the fire and smoke and burning sulfur that came from the mouths of the horses.",
      "19": "Their power was in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails had heads like snakes, with the power to injure people.",
      "20": "But the people who did not die in these plagues still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—idols that can neither see nor hear nor walk!",
