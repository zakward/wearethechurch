      "1": "Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us.",
      "2": "They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.",
      "3": "Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus,",
      "4": "so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught.",
      "5": "When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron.",
      "6": "Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God’s eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord’s commandments and regulations.",
      "7": "They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.",
      "8": "One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week.",
      "9": "As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense.",
      "10": "While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.",
      "11": "While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar.",
      "12": "Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him.",
      "13": "But the angel said, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John.",
      "14": "You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,",
      "15": "for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.",
      "16": "And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God.",
      "17": "He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.”",
      "18": "Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure this will happen? I’m an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.”",
      "19": "Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!",
      "20": "But now, since you didn’t believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time.”",
      "21": "Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long.",
      "22": "When he finally did come out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.",
      "23": "When Zechariah’s week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home.",
      "24": "Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.",
      "25": "“How kind the Lord is!” she exclaimed. “He has taken away my disgrace of having no children.”",
      "26": "In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,",
      "27": "to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.",
      "28": "Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you!”",
      "29": "Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.",
      "30": "“Don’t be afraid, Mary,” the angel told her, “for you have found favor with God!",
      "31": "You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.",
      "32": "He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.",
      "33": "And he will reign over Israel forever; his Kingdom will never end!”",
      "34": "Mary asked the angel, “But how can this happen? I am a virgin.”",
      "35": "The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.",
      "36": "What’s more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month.",
      "37": "For the word of God will never fail.”",
      "38": "Mary responded, “I am the Lord’s servant. May everything you have said about me come true.” And then the angel left her.",
      "39": "A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town",
      "40": "where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.",
      "41": "At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.",
      "42": "Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed.",
      "43": "Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?",
      "44": "When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.",
      "45": "You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said.”",
      "46": "Mary responded,\n“Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.",
      "47": "How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!",
      "48": "For he took notice of his lowly servant girl,\n    and from now on all generations will call me blessed.",
      "49": "For the Mighty One is holy,\n    and he has done great things for me.",
      "50": "He shows mercy from generation to generation\n    to all who fear him.",
      "51": "His mighty arm has done tremendous things!\n    He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.",
      "52": "He has brought down princes from their thrones\n    and exalted the humble.",
      "53": "He has filled the hungry with good things\n    and sent the rich away with empty hands.",
      "54": "He has helped his servant Israel\n    and remembered to be merciful.",
      "55": "For he made this promise to our ancestors,\n    to Abraham and his children forever.”",
      "56": "Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.",
      "57": "When it was time for Elizabeth’s baby to be born, she gave birth to a son.",
      "58": "And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.",
      "59": "When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father.",
      "60": "But Elizabeth said, “No! His name is John!”",
      "61": "“What?” they exclaimed. “There is no one in all your family by that name.”",
      "62": "So they used gestures to ask the baby’s father what he wanted to name him.",
      "63": "He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s surprise he wrote, “His name is John.”",
      "64": "Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.",
      "65": "Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills.",
      "66": "Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, “What will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.",
      "67": "Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:",
      "68": "“Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    because he has visited and redeemed his people.",
      "69": "He has sent us a mighty Savior\n    from the royal line of his servant David,",
      "70": "just as he promised\n    through his holy prophets long ago.",
      "71": "Now we will be saved from our enemies\n    and from all who hate us.",
      "72": "He has been merciful to our ancestors\n    by remembering his sacred covenant—",
      "73": "the covenant he swore with an oath\n    to our ancestor Abraham.",
      "74": "We have been rescued from our enemies\n    so we can serve God without fear,",
      "75": "in holiness and righteousness\n    for as long as we live.",
      "76": "“And you, my little son,\n    will be called the prophet of the Most High,\n    because you will prepare the way for the Lord.",
      "77": "You will tell his people how to find salvation\n    through forgiveness of their sins.",
      "78": "Because of God’s tender mercy,\n    the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us,",
      "79": "to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,\n    and to guide us to the path of peace.”",
      "80": "John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel."

      "1": "At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.",
      "2": "(This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)",
      "3": "All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census.",
      "4": "And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David’s ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee.",
      "5": "He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.",
      "6": "And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.",
      "7": "She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.",
      "8": "That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.",
      "9": "Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord’s glory surrounded them. They were terrified,",
      "10": "but the angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.",
      "11": "The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!",
      "12": "And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.”",
      "13": "Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying,",
      "14": "“Glory to God in highest heaven,\n    and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.”",
      "15": "When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”",
      "16": "They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.",
      "17": "After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.",
      "18": "All who heard the shepherds’ story were astonished,",
      "19": "but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.",
      "20": "The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.",
      "21": "Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.",
      "22": "Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.",
      "23": "The law of the Lord says, “If a woman’s first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the Lord.”",
      "24": "So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord—“either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”",
      "25": "At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him",
      "26": "and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.",
      "27": "That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required,",
      "28": "Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,",
      "29": "“Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace,\n    as you have promised.",
      "30": "I have seen your salvation,",
      "31": "which you have prepared for all people.",
      "32": "He is a light to reveal God to the nations,\n    and he is the glory of your people Israel!”",
      "33": "Jesus’ parents were amazed at what was being said about him.",
      "34": "Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby’s mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, and many others to rise. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him.",
      "35": "As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul.”",
      "36": "Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years.",
      "37": "Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer.",
      "38": "She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.",
      "39": "When Jesus’ parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.",

      "42": "When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual.",
      "43": "After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn’t miss him at first,",
      "44": "because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn’t show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.",
      "45": "When they couldn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there.",
      "46": "Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions.",
      "47": "All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.",
      "48": "His parents didn’t know what to think. “Son,” his mother said to him, “why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere.”",
      "49": "“But why did you need to search?” he asked. “Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”",
      "50": "But they didn’t understand what he meant.",
      "51": "Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.",

      "3": "A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, ‘Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.’",
      "4": "The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said to himself, ‘I don’t fear God or care about people,",
      "5": "but this woman is driving me crazy. I’m going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!’”",
      "6": "Then the Lord said, “Learn a lesson from this unjust judge.",
      "7": "Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don’t you think God will surely give justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?",
      "8": "I tell you, he will grant justice to them quickly! But when the Son of Man returns, how many will he find on the earth who have faith?”",
      "9": "Then Jesus told this story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else:",
      "10": "“Two men went to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a despised tax collector.",
      "11": "The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer: ‘I thank you, God, that I am not like other people—cheaters, sinners, adulterers. I’m certainly not like that tax collector!",
      "12": "I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my income.’",
      "13": "“But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow, saying, ‘O God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.’",
      "14": "I tell you, this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”",
      "15": "One day some parents brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But when the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents for bothering him.",
      "16": "Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, “Let the children come to me. Don’t stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.",
      "17": "I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn’t receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.”",
      "18": "Once a religious leader asked Jesus this question: “Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”",
      "19": "“Why do you call me good?” Jesus asked him. “Only God is truly good.",
      "20": "But to answer your question, you know the commandments: ‘You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. Honor your father and mother.’”",
      "21": "The man replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.”",
      "22": "When Jesus heard his answer, he said, “There is still one thing you haven’t done. Sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”",
      "23": "But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was very rich.",
      "24": "When Jesus saw this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!",
      "25": "In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!”",
      "26": "Those who heard this said, “Then who in the world can be saved?”",
      "27": "He replied, “What is impossible for people is possible with God.”",
      "28": "Peter said, “We’ve left our homes to follow you.”",
      "29": "“Yes,” Jesus replied, “and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God,",
      "30": "will be repaid many times over in this life, and will have eternal life in the world to come.”",
      "31": "Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus said, “Listen, we’re going up to Jerusalem, where all the predictions of the prophets concerning the Son of Man will come true.",
      "32": "He will be handed over to the Romans, and he will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit upon.",
      "33": "They will flog him with a whip and kill him, but on the third day he will rise again.”",
      "34": "But they didn’t understand any of this. The significance of his words was hidden from them, and they failed to grasp what he was talking about.",
      "35": "As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting beside the road.",
      "36": "When he heard the noise of a crowd going past, he asked what was happening.",
      "37": "They told him that Jesus the Nazarene was going by.",
      "38": "So he began shouting, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
      "39": "“Be quiet!” the people in front yelled at him.\nBut he only shouted louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
      "40": "When Jesus heard him, he stopped and ordered that the man be brought to him. As the man came near, Jesus asked him,",
      "41": "“What do you want me to do for you?”\n“Lord,” he said, “I want to see!”",
      "42": "And Jesus said, “All right, receive your sight! Your faith has healed you.”",
      "43": "Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus, praising God. And all who saw it praised God, too."

      "3": "He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowd.",
      "4": "So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree beside the road, for Jesus was going to pass that way.",
      "5": "When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. “Zacchaeus!” he said. “Quick, come down! I must be a guest in your home today.”",

      "10": "For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.”",
      "11": "The crowd was listening to everything Jesus said. And because he was nearing Jerusalem, he told them a story to correct the impression that the Kingdom of God would begin right away.",
      "12": "He said, “A nobleman was called away to a distant empire to be crowned king and then return.",
      "13": "Before he left, he called together ten of his servants and divided among them ten pounds of silver, saying, ‘Invest this for me while I am gone.’",
      "14": "But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want him to be our king.’",
      "15": "“After he was crowned king, he returned and called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to find out what their profits were.",
      "16": "The first servant reported, ‘Master, I invested your money and made ten times the original amount!’",

      "21": "I was afraid because you are a hard man to deal with, taking what isn’t yours and harvesting crops you didn’t plant.’",
      "22": "“‘You wicked servant!’ the king roared. ‘Your own words condemn you. If you knew that I’m a hard man who takes what isn’t mine and harvests crops I didn’t plant,",
      "23": "why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.’",
      "24": "“Then, turning to the others standing nearby, the king ordered, ‘Take the money from this servant, and give it to the one who has ten pounds.’",

      "26": "“‘Yes,’ the king replied, ‘and to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.",
      "27": "And as for these enemies of mine who didn’t want me to be their king—bring them in and execute them right here in front of me.’”",

      "34": "And the disciples simply replied, “The Lord needs it.”",
      "35": "So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to ride on.",
      "36": "As he rode along, the crowds spread out their garments on the road ahead of him.",
      "37": "When he reached the place where the road started down the Mount of Olives, all of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen.",
      "38": "“Blessings on the King who comes in the name of the Lord!\n    Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!”",
      "39": "But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, “Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!”",

      "14": "“But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to each other, ‘Here comes the heir to this estate. Let’s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!’",
      "15": "So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him.\n“What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?” Jesus asked.",
      "16": "“I’ll tell you—he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.”\n“How terrible that such a thing should ever happen,” his listeners protested.",
      "17": "Jesus looked at them and said, “Then what does this Scripture mean?\n‘The stone that the builders rejected\n    has now become the cornerstone.’",
      "18": "Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on.”",
      "19": "The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people’s reaction.",
      "20": "Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus.",
      "21": "“Teacher,” they said, “we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully.",
      "22": "Now tell us—is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”",
      "23": "He saw through their trickery and said,",
      "24": "“Show me a Roman coin. Whose picture and title are stamped on it?”\n“Caesar’s,” they replied.",
      "25": "“Well then,” he said, “give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.”",
      "26": "So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent.",
      "27": "Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead.",
      "28": "They posed this question: “Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.",
      "29": "Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children.",
      "30": "So the second brother married the widow, but he also died.",
      "31": "Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children.",
      "32": "Finally, the woman also died.",
      "33": "So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her!”",
      "34": "Jesus replied, “Marriage is for people here on earth.",
      "35": "But in the age to come, those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.",
      "36": "And they will never die again. In this respect they will be like angels. They are children of God and children of the resurrection.",
      "37": "“But now, as to whether the dead will be raised—even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, he referred to the Lord as ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’",
      "38": "So he is the God of the living, not the dead, for they are all alive to him.”",
      "39": "“Well said, Teacher!” remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there.",
      "40": "And then no one dared to ask him any more questions.",
      "41": "Then Jesus presented them with a question. “Why is it,” he asked, “that the Messiah is said to be the son of David?",
      "42": "For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms:\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n    Sit in the place of honor at my right hand",
      "43": "until I humble your enemies,\n    making them a footstool under your feet.’",

      "42": "“Father, if you are willing, please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.”",
      "43": "Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him.",
      "44": "He prayed more fervently, and he was in such agony of spirit that his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood.",
      "45": "At last he stood up again and returned to the disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted from grief.",
      "46": "“Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation.”",
      "47": "But even as Jesus said this, a crowd approached, led by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. Judas walked over to Jesus to greet him with a kiss.",
      "48": "But Jesus said, “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”",
      "49": "When the other disciples saw what was about to happen, they exclaimed, “Lord, should we fight? We brought the swords!”",
      "50": "And one of them struck at the high priest’s slave, slashing off his right ear.",
      "51": "But Jesus said, “No more of this.” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.",
      "52": "Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests, the captains of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come for him. “Am I some dangerous revolutionary,” he asked, “that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?",
      "53": "Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns.”",
      "54": "So they arrested him and led him to the high priest’s home. And Peter followed at a distance.",
      "55": "The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter joined them there.",
      "56": "A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, “This man was one of Jesus’ followers!”",
      "57": "But Peter denied it. “Woman,” he said, “I don’t even know him!”",
      "58": "After a while someone else looked at him and said, “You must be one of them!”\n“No, man, I’m not!” Peter retorted.",
      "59": "About an hour later someone else insisted, “This must be one of them, because he is a Galilean, too.”",
      "60": "But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.",
      "61": "At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly, the Lord’s words flashed through Peter’s mind: “Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.”",
      "62": "And Peter left the courtyard, weeping bitterly.",
      "63": "The guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him.",
      "64": "They blindfolded him and said, “Prophesy to us! Who hit you that time?”",
      "65": "And they hurled all sorts of terrible insults at him.",
      "66": "At daybreak all the elders of the people assembled, including the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. Jesus was led before this high council,",
      "67": "and they said, “Tell us, are you the Messiah?”\nBut he replied, “If I tell you, you won’t believe me.",
      "68": "And if I ask you a question, you won’t answer.",
      "69": "But from now on the Son of Man will be seated in the place of power at God’s right hand.”",
      "70": "They all shouted, “So, are you claiming to be the Son of God?”\nAnd he replied, “You say that I am.”",
      "71": "“Why do we need other witnesses?” they said. “We ourselves heard him say it.”"

      "1": "Then the entire council took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.",
      "2": "They began to state their case: “This man has been leading our people astray by telling them not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is the Messiah, a king.”",
      "3": "So Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\nJesus replied, “You have said it.”",
      "4": "Pilate turned to the leading priests and to the crowd and said, “I find nothing wrong with this man!”",
      "5": "Then they became insistent. “But he is causing riots by his teaching wherever he goes—all over Judea, from Galilee to Jerusalem!”",
      "6": "“Oh, is he a Galilean?” Pilate asked.",
      "7": "When they said that he was, Pilate sent him to Herod Antipas, because Galilee was under Herod’s jurisdiction, and Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time.",
      "8": "Herod was delighted at the opportunity to see Jesus, because he had heard about him and had been hoping for a long time to see him perform a miracle.",
      "9": "He asked Jesus question after question, but Jesus refused to answer.",
      "10": "Meanwhile, the leading priests and the teachers of religious law stood there shouting their accusations.",
      "11": "Then Herod and his soldiers began mocking and ridiculing Jesus. Finally, they put a royal robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.",
      "12": "(Herod and Pilate, who had been enemies before, became friends that day.)",
      "13": "Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders, along with the people,",
      "14": "and he announced his verdict. “You brought this man to me, accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent.",
      "15": "Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us. Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty.",
      "16": "So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him.”",
      "17": "",
      "18": "Then a mighty roar rose from the crowd, and with one voice they shouted, “Kill him, and release Barabbas to us!”",

      "20": "Pilate argued with them, because he wanted to release Jesus.",
      "21": "But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”",
      "22": "For the third time he demanded, “Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him.”",
      "23": "But the mob shouted louder and louder, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their voices prevailed.",
      "24": "So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded.",
      "25": "As they had requested, he released Barabbas, the man in prison for insurrection and murder. But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished.",
      "26": "As they led Jesus away, a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene, happened to be coming in from the countryside. The soldiers seized him and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
      "27": "A large crowd trailed behind, including many grief-stricken women.",
      "28": "But Jesus turned and said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.",
      "29": "For the days are coming when they will say, ‘Fortunate indeed are the women who are childless, the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed.’",
      "30": "People will beg the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and plead with the hills, ‘Bury us.’",
      "31": "For if these things are done when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”",
      "32": "Two others, both criminals, were led out to be executed with him.",
      "33": "When they came to a place called The Skull, they nailed him to the cross. And the criminals were also crucified—one on his right and one on his left.",
      "34": "Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.",
      "35": "The crowd watched and the leaders scoffed. “He saved others,” they said, “let him save himself if he is really God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”",
      "36": "The soldiers mocked him, too, by offering him a drink of sour wine.",
      "37": "They called out to him, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”",
      "38": "A sign was fastened above him with these words: “This is the King of the Jews.”",
      "39": "One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, “So you’re the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself—and us, too, while you’re at it!”",
      "40": "But the other criminal protested, “Don’t you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die?",
      "41": "We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn’t done anything wrong.”",
      "42": "Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”",

      "45": "The light from the sun was gone. And suddenly, the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle.",
      "46": "Then Jesus shouted, “Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!” And with those words he breathed his last.",
      "47": "When the Roman officer overseeing the execution saw what had happened, he worshiped God and said, “Surely this man was innocent.”",
      "48": "And when all the crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened, they went home in deep sorrow.",
      "49": "But Jesus’ friends, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching.",
      "50": "Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish high council,",
      "51": "but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come.",
      "52": "He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.",
      "53": "Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock.",
      "54": "This was done late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation, as the Sabbath was about to begin.",
      "55": "As his body was taken away, the women from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed.",
      "56": "Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body. But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun, so they rested as required by the law."

      "4": "As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes.",
      "5": "The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive?",
      "6": "He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead! Remember what he told you back in Galilee,",
      "7": "that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and that he would rise again on the third day.”",
      "8": "Then they remembered that he had said this.",
      "9": "So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples—and everyone else—what had happened.",
      "10": "It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and several other women who told the apostles what had happened.",
      "11": "But the story sounded like nonsense to the men, so they didn’t believe it.",
      "12": "However, Peter jumped up and ran to the tomb to look. Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; then he went home again, wondering what had happened.",
      "13": "That same day two of Jesus’ followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem.",
      "14": "As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened.",
      "15": "As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them.",
      "16": "But God kept them from recognizing him.",
      "17": "He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”\nThey stopped short, sadness written across their faces.",
      "18": "Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, “You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn’t heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days.”",
      "19": "“What things?” Jesus asked.\n“The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth,” they said. “He was a prophet who did powerful miracles, and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people.",
      "20": "But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him.",
      "21": "We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago.",
      "22": "“Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report.",
      "23": "They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive!",
      "24": "Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, his body was gone, just as the women had said.”",
      "25": "Then Jesus said to them, “You foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.",
      "26": "Wasn’t it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory?”",
      "27": "Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.",
      "28": "By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus acted as if he were going on,",
      "29": "but they begged him, “Stay the night with us, since it is getting late.” So he went home with them.",
      "30": "As they sat down to eat, he took the bread and blessed it. Then he broke it and gave it to them.",
      "31": "Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And at that moment he disappeared!",
      "32": "They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?”",
      "33": "And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them,",
      "34": "who said, “The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter.”",
      "35": "Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road, and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread.",
      "36": "And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. “Peace be with you,” he said.",
      "37": "But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!",
      "38": "“Why are you frightened?” he asked. “Why are your hearts filled with doubt?",
      "39": "Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it’s really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don’t have bodies, as you see that I do.”",
      "40": "As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.",
      "41": "Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”",
      "42": "They gave him a piece of broiled fish,",
      "43": "and he ate it as they watched.",
      "44": "Then he said, “When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.”",
      "45": "Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.",
      "46": "And he said, “Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.",
      "47": "It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: ‘There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.’",
      "48": "You are witnesses of all these things.",
      "49": "“And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven.”",
      "50": "Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them.",
      "51": "While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven.",
      "52": "So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy.",
      "53": "And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God."
