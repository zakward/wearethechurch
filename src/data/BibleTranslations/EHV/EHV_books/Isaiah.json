      "24": "Therefore the Lord, the Lord of Armies,\nthe Mighty One of Israel, says:\n    I must certainly get relief from my adversaries.\n    I will avenge myself on my enemies.",
      "25": "I will turn my hand against you.\n    I will smelt away all your slag.\n    I will take away all your impurities.",
      "26": "I will restore your judges as they were at first,\n    and your advisors as they were in the beginning.\nAfterward you will be called a righteous city, a faithful town.",
      "27": "Zion will be redeemed with justice,\nand those who return to her will be redeemed with righteousness.",

      "5": "O house of Jacob, come,\nand let us walk in the light of the Lord.",
      "6": "But you, Lord, have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,\nbecause they are filled up with practices from the East\nand with fortune tellers like the Philistines,\nand they join themselves to the heathen.",
