  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel asked the Lord, “Who should go up against the Canaanites for us? Who of us should be the first to wage war against them?”",
      "2": "The Lord said, “Judah should go up. I have handed over the land to them.”",
      "3": "So the tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, their brothers, “Go up with us to the territory that has been allotted to us, and together we will wage war against the Canaanites. We also will come with you into your allotment.” So Simeon went with Judah.",
      "4": "When Judah went up, the Lord delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hand. At Bezek the Israelites struck down ten thousand men.",
      "5": "They encountered Adoni-Bezek at Bezek, and they waged war against him and struck down the Canaanites and the Perizzites.",
      "6": "Adoni-Bezek fled, but they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.",
      "7": "So Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their big toes cut off, had to scrounge for scraps of food under my table. God has repaid me with exactly what I did to them.” Israel brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "The men of Judah waged war against Jerusalem and captured it. They struck the city with the edge of the sword and set it on fire.",
      "9": "After that, the men of Judah went down to wage war against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the Shephelah.",
      "10": "Judah went up against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron before this was Kiriath Arba). There they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "From there they went up against those who lived at Debir (the name of Debir before this was Kiriath Sepher).",
      "12": "Then Caleb said, “To the one who attacks Kiriath Sepher and takes it, I will give my daughter Aksah as his wife.”",
      "13": "Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s youngest brother, captured it. So Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him as his wife.",
      "14": "She came to Othniel and pressured him to ask her father for pastureland. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”",
      "15": "She said to him, “Give me this blessing: Since you gave me land in the dry Negev, give me springs of water also.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.",
      "16": "The descendants of the Kenite father-in-law of Moses went up with the people of Judah from the City of Palms to the part of the Wilderness of Judah that was in the Negev near Arad. They went and lived there among the people.",
      "17": "The tribe of Judah went along with the tribe of Simeon, its brother tribe. Together they struck down the Canaanites who lived in Zephath. They devoted the city to destruction and named the city Hormah.",
      "18": "Judah also captured Gaza with its border region, Ashkelon with its border region, and Ekron with its border region.",
      "19": "The Lord was with Judah, and Judah took possession of the hill country, but Judah could not take possession of the land belonging to the people who lived in the valleys and lowlands, because they had iron chariots.",
      "20": "Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had commanded, and he took possession of the land of the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "But the men of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites live among the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.",
      "22": "The house of Joseph likewise went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "The house of Joseph sent spies to scout Bethel (the name of the city was formerly Luz).",
      "24": "The spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us a way into the city, and we will grant you mercy.”",
      "25": "The man showed them a way into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and his whole family go.",
      "26": "The man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz. That is its name to this day.",
      "27": "But the tribe of Manasseh did not take possession of Beth Shan and its towns or Ta’anach and its towns. They did not drive out the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, so the Canaanites were determined to keep living in this land.",
      "28": "Whenever Israel grew strong, they made the Canaanites perform forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.",
      "29": "In the same way, Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living at Gezer. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them at Gezer.",
      "30": "Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them. Zebulun did subject them to forced labor.",
      "31": "Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Akko, the inhabitants of Sidon, or those in Ahlab, Akzib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob.",
      "32": "Instead, the people of Asher lived among the Canaanites, who continued to live in the land because the Asherites did not drive them out.",
      "33": "Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath. Instead, they continued to live among the Canaanites, who continued to live in the land, but the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath did perform forced labor for Naphtali.",
      "34": "The Amorites forced the men of Dan back into the hill country. They did not allow them to come down to the lowlands.",
      "35": "The Amorites were determined to continue living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Sha’albim, but the hand of the house of Joseph grew heavy on them, and they were put to forced labor.",
      "36": "The border of the Amorites stretched from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and beyond."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "The Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim, and he said, “I brought you up out of Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, ‘I will not break my covenant with you, forever.",
      "2": "As for you, do not make a covenant with the people living in this land. You must tear down their altars.’ But you did not listen to my voice. What is this you have done?",
      "3": "So I say, ‘I will not drive them out before you, but they will be traps for you, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”",
      "4": "When the Angel of the Lord spoke these things to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept loudly.",
      "5": "They named that place Bokim, and they sacrificed to the Lord there.",
      "6": "When Joshua dismissed the people, each of the descendants of Israel went to his own inheritance to take possession of the land.",
      "7": "The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, those who had seen all the great deeds that the Lord had done for Israel.",
      "8": "Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred ten years.",
      "9": "They buried him within the borders of his inheritance, in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Ga’ash.",
      "10": "After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them, who did not know the Lord or the deeds that he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "The people of Israel committed evil in the eyes of the Lord. They served the Baals,",
      "12": "and they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them. They bowed down to them, and they angered the Lord.",
      "13": "They abandoned the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtartes.",
      "14": "So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of raiders, who plundered them. He sold them into the hand of their enemies around them, and they were not able to stand up in the face of their enemies.",
      "15": "Whenever the men of Israel went out, the hand of the Lord was against them to bring disaster on them, just as the Lord had said to them and just as the Lord had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed.",
      "16": "Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges, who saved them from the hand of those who plundered them,",
      "17": "but they did not listen even to the judges! Instead, they prostituted themselves to other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way in which their fathers, who had obeyed the commands of the Lord, had once walked. This generation did not act the same way their fathers had acted.",
      "18": "Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them, the Lord was with that judge and saved them from their enemies during all the days of that judge, because the Lord had compassion when he heard their groaning under their tormenters and oppressors.",
      "19": "But then, after the death of the judge, Israel would turn back and become more corrupt than their fathers by going after other gods, by serving them, and by worshipping them. They refused to let go of their practices and their shameless ways.",
      "20": "So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel. He said, “Because this nation has violated my covenant, which I commanded to their fathers, and because they did not obey my voice,",
      "21": "I will no longer drive out from among them a single one of the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died.",
      "22": "I will do this in order to test Israel by means of them. Will Israel keep the way of the Lord and walk upon it as their fathers kept it, or not?”",
      "23": "So the Lord gave those nations a reprieve, and he did not drive them out quickly. He did not hand them over to Joshua."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "The following are the nations that the Lord left in place in order to test all the Israelites who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan.",
      "2": "(This was done so that the generations of Israelites who did not know war would learn how to wage war.)",
      "3": "Those who remained were the five serens of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwell in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.",
      "4": "They remained there to test Israel, in order to know whether or not they would obey the commands of the Lord, which he commanded to their fathers by the hand of Moses.",
      "5": "The people of Israel lived in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.",
      "6": "They took the daughters of these peoples as wives for themselves, and they gave their own daughters to the other peoples’ sons. They also served their gods.",
      "7": "Then the people of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.",
      "8": "The anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim, who was the king of Aram Naharaim. The Israelites served Cushan Rishathaim for eight years.",
      "9": "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up a deliverer for the Israelites, who saved them.\nThe deliverer was Othniel, son of Kenaz, the youngest brother of Caleb.",
      "10": "The Spirit of the Lord was upon him. He served as Israel’s judge. When he went out to wage war, the Lord gave Cushan Rishathaim, the king of Aram, into his hand, and his hand was strong against Cushan Rishathaim.",
      "11": "Then the land was quiet for forty years, and Othniel son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "Again the people of Israel committed evil in the eyes of the Lord, so the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel because they had committed evil in the eyes of the Lord.",
      "13": "Eglon took Ammonites and Amalekites along with him. He advanced and attacked Israel and took possession of the City of Palms.",
      "14": "So the people of Israel served Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.",
      "15": "Again the people of Israel called out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up a deliverer for them. The deliverer was Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite, who was left-handed.\nThe Israelites sent him with a tribute payment for Eglon king of Moab.",
      "16": "Ehud made a double-edged sword for himself, about eighteen inches long, and he strapped it under his clothing on his right thigh.",
      "17": "Ehud presented the tribute payment to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.",
      "18": "After Ehud had presented the tribute payment, he sent the men who had delivered the tribute on their way.",
      "19": "But after he himself had passed the carved images that were at Gilgal, Ehud turned back and told the king, “I have a secret for you, O king!”\nThe king said, “Quiet, everyone,” so all his attendants left the room.",
      "20": "Ehud approached Eglon as Eglon was sitting in the cool upper chamber, all alone. Ehud said, “I have something from God for you.” So Eglon stood up from the throne.",
      "21": "Ehud reached out his left hand and took the sword that was on his right thigh and drove it into Eglon’s belly.",
      "22": "As the hilt went in after the blade, Eglon’s fat closed behind the blade. Ehud did not draw the sword out from Eglon’s belly, and the contents of his bowels came out.",
      "23": "Ehud then went out to the vestibule, shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him, and locked them.",
      "24": "Then off he went!\nWhen Eglon’s servants came back, they were surprised to see that the doors of the upper chamber were locked. They said, “He must be using the toilet.”",
      "25": "They waited until the delay became embarrassing, but no one opened the doors to the upper chamber. Finally they took the key and opened the door. And there he was. Their master was lying on the ground—dead!",
      "26": "While they delayed, Ehud had escaped. He passed by the carved images and escaped to Seirah.",
      "27": "When he arrived, ram’s horns were sounded throughout the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites marched down from the hill country with Ehud leading the way.",
      "28": "He said to them, “Follow me, because the Lord has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands.” So they pursued them, captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and let no one cross.",
      "29": "At this time they struck down about ten thousand men of Moab, every one robust, each one a powerful warrior. Not one escaped.",
      "30": "This is how Moab was humbled on that day under the hand of Israel, and the land was quiet for eighty years.",
      "31": "After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. He struck down six hundred Philistines with an ox goad. He too delivered Israel."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "After Ehud died, once again the people of Israel committed evil in the eyes of the Lord.",
      "2": "So the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.",
      "3": "Again the people of Israel called out to the Lord, because Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots. He brutally oppressed the people of Israel for twenty years.",
      "4": "Deborah, a woman, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.",
      "5": "She would sit under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel would come to her for judgment.",
      "6": "She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali. She said to him, “The Lord, the God of Israel, has commanded, ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun.",
      "7": "I will lure Sisera, commander of the army of Jabin, to you at the stream Kishon along with his chariots and his horde, and I will give him into your hand.’”",
      "8": "But Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go.”",
      "9": "She answered, “All right. I will go with you, but because of the way you are going about it, the honor will not be yours. The Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "Barak called up the forces of Zebulun and Naphtali to meet at Kedesh. Ten thousand men went up on foot, and Deborah also went up with him.",
      "11": "It happened that Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the other Kenites, who were the descendants of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, and he had set up his tent out by the oak tree in Za’anannim near Kedesh.",
      "12": "When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
      "13": "Sisera led out all his chariots (nine hundred iron chariots) and all the people who were with him from Harosheth Haggoyim, and they came to the stream Kishon.",
      "14": "Deborah said to Barak, “Get up! Today is the day that the Lord has given Sisera into your hands! Is not the Lord going ahead of you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men followed him.",
      "15": "The Lord threw Sisera, all his chariots, and all his troops into confusion with the edge of the sword of Barak. So Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.",
      "16": "Barak pursued the chariots and the troops as far as Harosheth Haggoyim. Sisera’s whole army fell by the edge of the sword. Not a single man was left.",
      "17": "Sisera meanwhile fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the household of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “This way, my lord. Come here to me! Do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her, went into her tent, and she hid him with a covering.",
      "19": "He said to her, “Give me something to drink, please—just a little water, because I am thirsty.” She opened a skin of milk and gave him some milk to drink. Then she covered him up.",
      "20": "After that, he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’”",
      "21": "But then Jael wife of Heber took a tent stake, and gripping a hammer in her hand, she came to Sisera quietly and drove the stake through his temple, right through into the ground. Sisera had been fast asleep, exhausted—now he was dead!",
      "22": "When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael came out to meet him. She said to him, “Come in, and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he went with her, and there he was. Sisera was lying there dead, with the tent stake through his temple.",
      "23": "So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the people of Israel,",
      "24": "and the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan, until they cut down Jabin king of Canaan."

      "1": "On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:",
      "2": "When leaders take the lead in Israel,\nwhen the people freely offer themselves, bless the Lord!",
      "3": "Listen, kings! Lend an ear, rulers!\nI will sing. Yes, I will sing to the Lord.\nI will make music for the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "4": "Lord, when you went out from Seir,\nwhen you marched through the countryside of Edom,\n    the earth shook, the skies poured,\n    yes, the dark clouds poured water.",
      "5": "The mountains melted before the Lord—this one of Sinai—\nbefore the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "6": "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,\nin the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted,\nand travelers kept to pathways and winding roads.",
      "7": "Life in the unwalled towns came to a halt.\nIn Israel, life came to a halt until I, Deborah, arose,\nuntil I arose as a mother in Israel.",
      "8": "When Israel chose new gods, there was war at the gates.\nNeither shield nor spear was seen among the forty thousand in Israel.",
      "9": "My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel,\nto those who freely offer themselves among the people. Bless the Lord!",
      "10": "Riders on tan donkey mares, you who sit on saddle blankets,\nas well as those who walk along the way—consider this:",
      "11": "Listen to the voices of those who divide flocks between water holes,\nwhere they recount the righteous acts of the Lord,\nrighteous acts for those who live in the unwalled towns in Israel.\nThen the people of the Lord went down to the city gates.",
      "12": "Wake, awake, Deborah!\n⎣Wake up the multitudes of the people.⎦\nWake, awake, sing a song.\nRise up, Barak!\n⎣Deborah, strengthen Barak.⎦ \nLead away your captives, son of Abinoam.",
      "13": "Then a survivor subdued the mighty ones.\nThe people of the Lord came down to me as warriors.",
      "14": "Some came from Ephraim—their root is in Amalek.\nBehind you came Benjamin with your people.\nFrom Makir the commanders came down,\nand from Zebulun those carrying the staff of a scribe.",
      "15": "The officers of Issachar are with Deborah.\nYes, Issachar sent support for Barak into the valley on foot.\nBut in the divisions of Reuben there was much soul searching.",
      "16": "Why did you linger among the sheepfolds\n    to listen to the whistling for the flocks?\nConcerning the divisions in Reuben, there was much soul searching.",
      "17": "Gilead remained beyond the Jordan,\nand Dan—why did he linger in ships?\nAsher remained sitting on the seashore,\nand upon its landing places he remained.",
      "18": "Zebulun is a people who scorned death and risked their lives,\nand Naphtali stayed on the heights of the battlefields.",
      "19": "Kings came; they waged war.\nThere the kings of Canaan waged war,\n    in Ta’anach, at the waters of Megiddo,\nbut they gained no silver as plunder.",
      "20": "From the heavens the stars waged war.\nFrom their courses they fought against Sisera.",
      "21": "The torrent Kishon swept them away,\nthe torrent from ancient times, the torrent Kishon.\nKeep marching, my soul, in strength.",
      "22": "Then the horses’ hoofs thundered,\nthe stampeding, the stampeding of their mighty stallions!",

      "25": "He asked for water, but she gave him milk.\nIn a bowl fit for a nobleman she presented curdled milk.",
      "26": "Her hand reached for the tent stake,\nher right hand for the workman’s hammer,\nand she hammered Sisera.\nShe smashed his head.\nShe shattered and pierced his temple.",
      "27": "Between her feet he knelt, he fell, he lay there.\nBetween her feet he knelt, he fell.\nWhere he sank, there he fell—destroyed.",
      "28": "Out the window she peers.\nSisera’s mother wails from behind the latticework.\n“Why is his chariot so late in coming?\nWhy do I still not hear the clatter of his chariots?”",
      "29": "The wise women among her ladies answer,\nbut she keeps saying to herself,",
      "30": "“Aren’t they just finding and dividing the plunder?\nA womb—no—two wombs for every man.\nDyed goods as plunder for Sisera, dyed fabrics as spoils,\nembroidered dyed material,\nfancy embroidered fabric for my neck, plunder.”",
      "31": "Thus may all your enemies perish, Lord.\nBut those who love him will be\n    like the sun coming forth in its strength.\nThen the land was quiet for forty years."

I dreamed that a round loaf of barley bread came tumbling over and over into the Midianite camp. It crashed into a tent and struck it so that the tent fell down. It overturned the tent, and the tent collapsed!”",

      "12": "Micah ordained the Levite, so the young man became his priest and lived in Micah’s house.",
      "13": "Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will treat me well, because I have this Levite as my priest.”"

      "1": "In those days there was no king in Israel.\nAlso in those days, some members of the tribe of Dan were seeking a territory of their own in which to live, because up to that day they had not taken possession of their inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.",
      "2": "So the descendants of Dan sent out from Zorah and Eshtaol five men who were strong warriors. They were to represent their clans and to scout the land and explore it. They said to the five men, “Go explore the land.” So they went to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and they spent the night there.",
      "3": "When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. They turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What advantage is there for you here?”",
      "4": "He told them what Micah had done for him: “He hired me, and I became his priest.”",
      "5": "They said to him, “Please inquire from God, so that we will know whether the way we are going will lead to success.”",
      "6": "The priest said to them, “Go in peace. The way you are going is approved by the Lord.”",
      "7": "So the five men continued their journey until they arrived at Laish. They saw that the people there were living in the same way as the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting. There was no one to disturb them or oppress them. They were far removed from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else.",
      "8": "Then the five spies returned to their fellow tribesmen at Zorah and Eshtaol. Their brothers said to them, “What do you think?”",
      "9": "The five answered, “Get up! Let us go up against them, ⎣for we have entered the land and journeyed as far as Laish. We saw how the people lived in security in the same way as the Sidonians, but they were far from the Sidonians, and they had no dealings with Aram. Get up! Let us go up against them,⎦ for we have seen the land. We assure you it is very good. Why are you still sitting here? Do not be slow. Get going to the land and take possession of it.",
      "10": "When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, whose land is spacious. Yes, God has given into your hands a place where there is no lack of anything on earth.”",
      "11": "So the clan of Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. There were six hundred men, equipped for war.",
      "12": "They went up and camped near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (That is why the place has been called Mahaneh Dan to this present day. It is west of Kiriath Jearim.)",
      "13": "Then they traveled on from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.",
      "14": "The five men who had gone out to spy on the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that in one of these houses there is a priestly vest and a household god, an engraved and a cast idol? So now, you know what to do.”",
      "15": "They turned in and entered the house of the young Levite at the homestead of Micah, and they asked him how he was doing.",
      "16": "Meanwhile, the six hundred descendants of Dan, equipped for war, were standing at the entrance of the gate.",
      "17": "The five men who had gone to spy on the land came and took the engraved idol, the priestly vest, the household god, and the cast idol while the priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men equipped for war.",
      "18": "When these five men came into the house of Micah and took the engraved idol, the priestly vest, the household god, and the cast idol, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”",
      "19": "They told him, “Be quiet. Put your hand over your mouth. Come with us and be our father and priest! Is it better for you to be priest for the household of one man or to be priest for an entire tribe and clan in Israel?”",
      "20": "Then the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the vest, the household god, and the engraved idol, and he went along with the people.",
      "21": "So they set out on their way and sent their children and their cattle and possessions ahead of them.",
      "22": "After the Danites had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who lived in the houses around the house of Micah were called out to pursue them, and they caught up with the Danites.",
      "23": "They called to the Danites, who turned toward them and said to Micah, “What is wrong with you? Why are you shouting like this?”",
      "24": "Micah replied, “You have taken my gods that I made and my priest, and you have gone off. What is left to me? How can you ask me, ‘What is wrong with you?’”",
      "25": "The Danites said to him, “Do not let us hear your voice. If you do, those men with a bad attitude will attack you, and you will lose your life, not to mention the lives of your household.”",
      "26": "The Danites then continued on their way, and when Micah saw that they were stronger than he was, he turned around and went back to his house.",
      "27": "So the Danites took what Micah had made and also his priest, and they went up against Laish, against a quiet and unsuspecting people, and they struck them down by the edge of the sword and burned down the city.",
      "28": "The people of Laish had no one to rescue them, because they were far away from Sidon, and they did not have any alliance with anyone else. The city was located in the valley near Beth Rehob.\nThe Danites rebuilt the city and lived there.",
      "29": "They named the city Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel, but Laish had been the original name of the city.",
      "30": "So the Danites set up the engraved idol for themselves, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons became priests for the tribe of Dan, up to the day of the captivity of the land.",
      "31": "They maintained for themselves the engraved idol that Micah had made, throughout all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh."

      "3": "Then her husband got up and went after her to appeal to her heart in order to win her back. He brought with him a young man, who was his servant, and a pair of donkeys.\nHis concubine let him into her father’s house, and when the woman’s father saw him, he was happy to see him.",
      "4": "The Levite’s father-in-law, the father of the young woman, prevailed upon the man to stay with him for three days, eating, drinking, and spending the night there.",

Please stay the night. Look! The day is slipping away! Spend the night here, and enjoy yourself! You can get up early tomorrow to be on your way and return to your home.”",
      "10": "But the Levite did not want to stay another night. Instead, he got up and went on his way, and he came to Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him the pair of saddled donkeys, as well as his concubine.",
      "11": "When they were getting close to Jebus and the day was almost gone, the young man said to his master, “Let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night there.”",
      "12": "But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a foreign city that does not belong to the people of Israel. We will go on to Gibeah.”",
      "13": "He said to his young man, “Come on, we will continue on to one of these other places. We can spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”",
      "14": "So they continued on, and as the sun was going down on them, they came close to Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin.",

The Benjaminites were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike down some of the people, killing them in the open country as they had done before, along the highway that goes up to Bethel and the one to Gibeah. They killed about thirty men of Israel.",

      "23": "So that is what the Benjaminites did. They grabbed and carried off as many women as they needed from among the dancers. Then they went and returned to their family property, rebuilt their cities, and lived in them.",
