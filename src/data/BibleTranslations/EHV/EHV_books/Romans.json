      "1": "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,",
      "2": "which he promised in advance through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures.",
      "3": "This gospel is about his Son—who in the flesh was born a descendant of David,",
      "4": "who in the spirit of holiness was declared to be God’s powerful Son by his resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ, our Lord.",
      "5": "Through him we received grace and the call to be an apostle on behalf of his name, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,",
      "6": "including you, who were called by Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "To all those loved by God who are in Rome, called to be saints:\nGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.",
      "9": "To be sure, God, whom I serve with my spirit by proclaiming the gospel of his Son, is my witness to how constantly I make mention of you. In all my prayers,",
      "10": "I always ask if perhaps at last a way might be opened, if God wills, for me to come to you.",
      "11": "I certainly long to see you, in order that I may deliver some spiritual gift to you, so that you are strengthened—",
      "12": "that is, when I am with you, that we will be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, yours and also mine.",
      "13": "I do not want you to be unaware of the fact, brothers, that I have often planned to come to you but have been prevented from doing so until now. I wanted to have some fruit among you in the same way as I did among the rest of the Gentiles.",
      "14": "I have an obligation both to Greeks and non-Greeks, to the wise and to the foolish.",
      "15": "That is why I am eager to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes—to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",
      "17": "For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed by faith, for faith, just as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”",
      "18": "Indeed, God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who try to suppress the truth by unrighteousness.",
      "19": "This happens because what can be known about God is evident among them, because God made it evident among them.",
      "20": "In fact, his invisible characteristics—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, because they are understood from the things he made. As a result, people are without excuse,",
      "21": "because, even though they knew God, they did not honor him or give him thanks as God. Instead, their thinking became nonsense, and their senseless heart was darkened.",
      "22": "Although they claim to be wise, they have become fools",
      "23": "and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human, or like birds, four-footed animals, and crawling things.",
      "24": "So, as they followed the sinful desires of their hearts, God handed them over to the impurity of degrading their own bodies among themselves.",
      "25": "Such people have traded the truth about God for the lie, worshipping and serving the creation rather than the Creator, who is worthy of praise forever. Amen.",
      "26": "For this reason God handed them over to disgraceful passions. Even their females exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.",
      "27": "And, in the same way, their males, after abandoning natural sexual relations with females, were consumed by their lust for one another. Males perform indecent acts with males and receive in themselves the penalty that is fitting for their perversion.",
      "28": "And since they did not consider it worthwhile to hold on to the true knowledge of God, God handed them over to a corrupted mind to do things that should never be done.",
      "29": "They are filled with every kind of unrighteousness, evil, greed, and wickedness. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and malice. They are gossipers,",
      "30": "slanderers, God-haters, insolent mockers, arrogant boasters, and loudmouths. They dream up evil things. They disobey their parents.",
      "31": "They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and merciless.",
      "32": "Even though they know God’s righteous decree that those who do these things are worthy of death, such people not only continue to do them, but also approve of others who continue to commit such sins."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore, you are without excuse, every one of you who judges someone else, because by judging the other person you also condemn yourself, since you, who are judging, are doing the very same things.",
      "2": "And we know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth.",
      "3": "Are you thinking that you will escape God’s judgment, you who judge those who do such things and then do the same things yourself?",
      "4": "Or do you have so little regard for his rich kindness, his restraint, and his patience, that you ignore the fact that the purpose of God’s kindness is to lead you to repentance?",
      "5": "As a result of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God will reveal his righteous judgment.",
      "6": "God “will repay each person according to what he has done”—",
      "7": "eternal life to those who seek glory, honor, and immortality by persisting in doing what is good,",
      "8": "but furious anger to those who out of selfish ambition are disobeying what is true and obeying what is wrong.",
      "9": "There will be trouble and distress for the soul of every person who does what is evil—for the Jew first and for the Greek—",
      "10": "but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does what is good—for the Jew first and for the Greek.",
      "11": "For God does not show favoritism.",
      "12": "Indeed, all people who have sinned without law will also perish without law, and all the people who have sinned in connection with law will be judged by law.",
      "13": "For it is not those who hear the law who will be righteous in God’s sight, but those who do the law who will be declared righteous.",
      "14": "In fact, whenever Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires—even though they do not have the law—they are a law for themselves.",
      "15": "They demonstrate the work of the law that is written in their hearts, since their conscience also bears witness as their thoughts go back and forth, at times accusing or at times even defending them.",
      "16": "This will happen on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge people’s secrets through Jesus Christ.",
      "17": "Now if you call yourself a Jew, and you find your comfort in the law, and you boast in God;",
      "18": "and if you know his will, and you approve the things that really matter, since you are instructed by the law;",
      "19": "and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,",
      "20": "an instructor of the ignorant, and a teacher of infants (since you have the essence of knowledge and truth in the law)—",
      "21": "now then, you, the one who is teaching someone else, do you fail to teach yourself? You who preach, “Do not steal,” do you steal?",
      "22": "You who say, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?",
      "23": "You who boast in the law bring shame on God by breaking the law.",
      "24": "Yes, as it is written, “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”",
      "25": "Indeed, circumcision has value if you observe the law. On the other hand, if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
      "26": "So, if an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be credited to him as circumcision?",
      "27": "The one who is not circumcised physically, but who fulfills the law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker, even though you have the written law and circumcision.",
      "28": "In fact, a Jew who is merely one outwardly is not really a Jew, and circumcision that is only outward in the flesh is not really circumcision.",
      "29": "Rather, a real Jew is one on the inside, and his circumcision is of the heart—a spiritual circumcision, not one based on carrying out the letter of the law. That person’s praise does not come from people but from God."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew? Or what benefit is there to circumcision?",
      "2": "Much in every way! Indeed, above all else, they were entrusted with the messages of God.",
      "3": "Now what if some did not believe? Their unbelief will not nullify God’s faithfulness, will it?",
      "4": "Absolutely not! God must be true, even though everyone is found to be a liar, just as it is written:\nSo that you would be justified whenever you speak,\nand win the case when you judge.",
      "5": "Now if our unrighteousness demonstrates God’s righteousness, what shall we say? God is not unjust in bringing his wrath on us, is he? (I am speaking from a human point of view.)",
      "6": "Absolutely not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?",
      "7": "For example, someone might say, “If by my lie the truth of God increases all the more to his glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?”",
      "8": "And why not say (as some slanderously claim we say), “Let us do evil so that good may result.” Their condemnation is deserved.",
      "9": "What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all! In fact, we have already made the charge that all (both Jews and Greeks) are under sin.",
      "10": "Just as it is written:\nThere is no one who is righteous, not even one.",
      "11": "There is no one who understands. There is no one who searches for God.",
      "12": "They all turned away; together they became useless.\nThere is no one who does what is good; there is not even one.",
      "13": "Their throat is an open grave.\nThey kept deceiving with their tongues.\nThe poison of asps is on their lips.",
      "14": "Their mouth is filled with cursing and bitterness.",
      "15": "Their feet are quick to shed blood.",
      "16": "They leave a trail of destruction and suffering wherever they go.",
      "17": "The way of peace they did not know.",
      "18": "There is no fear of God in front of their eyes.",
      "19": "Now we know that whatever the law says is addressed to those who are under the law, so that every mouth will be silenced and the whole world will be subject to God’s judgment.",
      "20": "For this reason, no one will be declared righteous in his sight by works of the law, for through the law we become aware of sin.",
      "21": "But now, completely apart from the law, a righteousness from God has been made known. The Law and the Prophets testify to it.",
      "22": "This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all and over all who believe.\nIn fact, there is no difference,",
      "23": "because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God",
      "24": "and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,",
      "25": "whom God publicly displayed as the atonement seat through faith in his blood. God did this to demonstrate his justice, since, in his divine restraint, he had left the sins that were committed earlier unpunished.",
      "26": "He did this to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so that he would be both just and the one who justifies the person who has faith in Jesus.",
      "27": "What happens to boasting then? It has been eliminated. By what principle—by the principle of works? No, but by the principle of faith.",
      "28": "For we conclude that a person is justified by faith without the works of the law.",
      "29": "Or is he only the God of the Jews? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,",
      "30": "since there is one God who will justify the circumcised person by faith and the uncircumcised person through the very same faith.",
      "31": "So are we doing away with the law by this faith? Absolutely not! Instead, we are upholding the law."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered according to the flesh?",
      "2": "If indeed Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had a reason to boast—but not before God.",
      "3": "For what does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "4": "Now to a person who works, his pay is not counted as a gift but as something owed.",
      "5": "But to the person who does not work but believes in the God who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness.",
      "6": "This is exactly what David says about the blessed state of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:",
      "7": "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven\nand whose sins are covered.",
      "8": "Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.",
      "9": "Now then, does this blessing apply only to the circumcised or also to the uncircumcised? To be sure, we maintain that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.",
      "10": "So then, under what circumstances was it credited to him? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised at that time? He was not circumcised but uncircumcised,",
      "11": "and he received the mark of circumcision as the seal of the righteousness by faith that was already his while he was uncircumcised. So Abraham is the father of all the uncircumcised people who believe, so that righteousness would also be credited to them.",
      "12": "He is also the father of the circumcised people who are not merely circumcised but also walk in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
      "13": "Indeed, the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not given to Abraham or his descendants through the law, but through the righteousness that is by faith.",
      "14": "To be sure, if people are heirs by the law, faith is empty and the promise is nullified.",
      "15": "For law brings wrath. (Where there is no law, there is no transgression.)",
      "16": "For this reason, the promise is by faith, so that it may be according to grace and may be guaranteed to all of Abraham’s descendants—not only to the one who is a descendant by law, but also to the one who has the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.",
      "17": "As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”\nIn the presence of God, Abraham believed him who makes the dead alive and calls non-existing things so that they exist.",
      "18": "Hoping beyond what he could expect, he believed that he would become the father of many nations, just as he was told: “This is how many your descendants will be.”",
      "19": "He did not weaken in faith, even though he considered his own body as good as dead (because he was about one hundred years old), and even though he considered Sarah’s womb to be dead.",
      "20": "He did not waver in unbelief with respect to God’s promise, but he grew strong in faith, giving glory to God",
      "21": "and being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.",
      "22": "This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
      "23": "Now the statement “it was credited to him” was not written for him alone,",
      "24": "but also for us to whom it would be credited, namely, to us who believe in the one who raised our Lord Jesus from the dead.",
      "25": "He was handed over to death because of our trespasses and was raised to life because of our justification."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "2": "Through him we also have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we rejoice confidently on the basis of our hope for the glory of God.",
      "3": "Not only this, but we also rejoice confidently in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces patient endurance,",
      "4": "and patient endurance produces tested character, and tested character produces hope.",
      "5": "And hope will not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who was given to us.",
      "6": "For at the appointed time, while we were still helpless, Christ died for the ungodly.",
      "7": "It is rare indeed that someone will die for a righteous person. Perhaps someone might actually go so far as to die for a person who has been good to him.",
      "8": "But God shows his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
      "9": "Therefore, since we have now been justified by his blood, it is even more certain that we will be saved from God’s wrath through him.",
      "10": "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, it is even more certain that, since we have been reconciled, we will be saved by his life.",
      "11": "And not only is this so, but we also go on rejoicing confidently in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received this reconciliation.",
      "12": "So then, just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned.",
      "13": "For even before the law was given, sin was in the world. Now, sin is not charged to one’s account if there is no law,",
      "14": "and yet death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those whose sin was not like the transgression of Adam, who is a pattern of the one who was to come.",
      "15": "But the gracious gift is not like Adam’s trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of this one man, it is even more certain that God’s grace, and the gift given by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, overflowed to the many!",
      "16": "And the gift is not like the effect of the one man’s sin, for the judgment that followed the one trespass resulted in a verdict of condemnation, but the gracious gift that followed many trespasses resulted in a verdict of justification.",
      "17": "Indeed, if by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through the one man, it is even more certain that those who receive the overflowing grace of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ!",
      "18": "So then, just as one trespass led to a verdict of condemnation for all people, so also one righteous verdict led to life-giving justification for all people.",
      "19": "For just as through the disobedience of one man the many became sinners, so also through the obedience of one man the many will become righteous.",
      "20": "The law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace overflowed much more,",
      "21": "so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "What shall we say then? Shall we keep on sinning so that grace may increase?",
      "2": "Absolutely not! We died to sin. How can we go on living in it any longer?",
      "3": "Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
      "4": "We were therefore buried with him by this baptism into his death, so that just as he was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too would also walk in a new life.",
      "5": "For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.",
      "6": "We know that our old self was crucified with him, to make our sinful body powerless, so that we would not continue to serve sin.",
      "7": "For the person who has died has been declared free from sin.",
      "8": "And since we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.",
      "9": "We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he will never die again. Death no longer has control over him.",
      "10": "For the death he died, he died to sin once and for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God.",
      "11": "In the same way also consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
      "12": "Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires.",
      "13": "Do not offer the members of your body to sin as tools of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and offer the members of your body to God as tools of righteousness.",
      "14": "Indeed, sin will not continue to control you, because you are not under law but under grace.",
      "15": "What then? Should we continue to sin, because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!",
      "16": "Do you not know that when you offer yourselves to obey someone as slaves, you are slaves of the one you are obeying—whether slaves of sin, resulting in death, or slaves of obedience, resulting in righteousness?",
      "17": "Thanks be to God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to the pattern of the teaching into which you were placed.",
      "18": "After you were set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.",
      "19": "(I am speaking in a human way because of the weakness of your flesh.) Indeed, just as you offered your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness, resulting in more lawlessness, so now offer your members in the same way as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.",
      "20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.",
      "21": "So what kind of fruit did you have then? They were things of which you are now ashamed. Yes, the final result of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now, since you were set free from sin and have become slaves to God, you have your fruit resulting in sanctification—and the final result is eternal life.",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the undeserved gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Or don’t you know, brothers (since I am speaking to those who know the law), that a law has jurisdiction over a person only as long as he lives?",
      "2": "For example, a married woman is bound to her husband by law as long as he is alive, but if he dies, she is released from this law regarding her husband.",
      "3": "So then, she will be labeled an adulteress if she is joined to another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, and she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.",
      "4": "In the same way, my brothers, you also were put to death in regard to the law by the body of Christ, so that you may be joined to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we might produce fruit for God.",
      "5": "For when we were in the flesh, strong sinful desires stirred up by the law were at work in our members, with the result that we produced fruit that results in death.",
      "6": "But now we have been released from the law by dying to what held us in its grip, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the letter of the law.",
      "7": "What will we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! On the contrary, I would not have recognized sin except through the law. For example, I would not have known about coveting if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”",
      "8": "But sin, seizing the opportunity provided by this commandment, produced every kind of sinful desire in me.\nFor apart from the law, sin is dead.",
      "9": "Once I was alive without the law. But when this commandment came, sin came to life,",
      "10": "and I died. This commandment that was intended to result in life actually resulted in death for me.",
      "11": "You see, sin, seizing the opportunity provided by this commandment, deceived me and put me to death through it.",
      "12": "So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.",
      "13": "Then did what is good become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, so that it might be recognized as sin, brings about my death by this good thing, so that through this commandment sin might prove itself to be totally sinful.",
      "14": "Certainly we know that the law is spiritual, but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.",
      "15": "For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not keep doing what I want. Instead, I do what I hate.",
      "16": "And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.",
      "17": "But now it is no longer I who am doing it, but it is sin living in me.",
      "18": "Indeed, I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my sinful flesh. The desire to do good is present with me, but I am not able to carry it out.",
      "19": "So I fail to do the good I want to do. Instead, the evil I do not want to do, that is what I keep doing.",
      "20": "Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who am doing it, but it is sin living in me.",
      "21": "So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is present with me.",
      "22": "I certainly delight in God’s law according to my inner self,",
      "23": "but I see a different law at work in my members, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin, which is present in my members.",
      "24": "What a miserable wretch I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?",
      "25": "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord!\nSo then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my sinful flesh I serve the law of sin."
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "So then, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.",
      "2": "For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.",
      "3": "Indeed, what the law was unable to do, because it was weakened by the flesh, God did, when he sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to deal with sin. God condemned sin in his flesh,",
      "4": "so that the righteous decree of the law would be fully satisfied in us who are not walking according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.",
      "5": "To be sure, those who are in harmony with the sinful flesh think about things the way the sinful flesh does, and those in harmony with the spirit think about things the way the spirit does.",
      "6": "Now, the way the sinful flesh thinks results in death, but the way the spirit thinks results in life and peace.",
      "7": "For the mind-set of the sinful flesh is hostile to God, since it does not submit to God’s law, and in fact, it cannot.",
      "8": "Those who are in the sinful flesh cannot please God.",
      "9": "But you are not in the sinful flesh but in the spirit, if indeed God’s Spirit lives in you. And if someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person does not belong to Christ.",
      "10": "But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but your spirit is alive because of righteousness.",
      "11": "And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit, who is dwelling in you.",
      "12": "So then, brothers, we do not owe it to the sinful flesh to live in harmony with it.",
