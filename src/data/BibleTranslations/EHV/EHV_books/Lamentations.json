      "18": "Their heart cried out to the Lord.\n    O wall of the daughter of Zion,\n    let your tears flow like a torrent, day and night.\n    Do not let yourself become numb. Do not let your eye stop crying.",
      "19": "Get up! Shout out during the night, as the night watches begin!\n    Pour out your heart like water before the Lord’s face.\n    Lift up your hands to him to pray for the life of your children,\n    who are faint with hunger at every street corner.",
      "20": "Look, Lord, and see! With whom have you dealt so harshly?\n    Should women eat the children they produced,\n    the children they played with on their knee?\n    Should priest and prophet be killed in the Lord’s holy place?",
      "21": "In the streets young and old lie dead on the ground.\n    My virgins and my best young men have fallen by the sword.\n    You killed them on the day of your anger. You slaughtered and did not spare.",
      "22": "As you do on a day of assembly, you summoned from every side the things I dread.\n    On the day of the Lord’s anger, there was no one who escaped or survived.\n    The enemy destroyed the children I played with on my knee and raised."
