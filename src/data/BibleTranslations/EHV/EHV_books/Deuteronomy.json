      "1": "These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the area beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran on one side and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di Zahab on the other.",
      "2": "(It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)",
      "3": "In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel everything that the Lord had commanded him concerning them.",
      "4": "This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and he had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.",
      "5": "In the area east of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses took on the task of explaining clearly this law as follows. This is what he said:",
      "6": "The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb. He said, “You have stayed at this mountain long enough.",
      "7": "Turn in the other direction, start traveling, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the people living in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the Shephelah, and in the Negev, and in the coastland by the sea (the land of the Canaanites) and the Lebanon range, up to the Great River (the River Euphrates).",
      "8": "Look now, I have given you the land that is ahead of you. Go and take possession of the land that the Lord swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising to give it to them and to their descendants after them.”",
      "9": "So I said to you at that time, “I am not able to carry you by myself.",
      "10": "The Lord your God has increased your number, and here you are today, as numerous as the stars in the heavens.",
      "11": "May the Lord, the God of your fathers, add to you a thousand times as many as you are now, and may he bless you, just as he promised you.",
      "12": "But how can I manage by myself to carry the burden that you have become and the load that you are—especially your disputes?",
      "13": "Provide for yourselves, tribe by tribe, men who are wise and perceptive and with known ability, and I will appoint them as your leaders.”",
      "14": "Then you answered me, “What you propose to do is good.”",
      "15": "So I took the heads of your tribes, men who were wise and of known ability, and I appointed them as heads over you, commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and commanders of fifties and commanders of tens, as well as officers for your tribes.",
      "16": "I gave these orders to your judges at that time: “Listen to disputes among your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother Israelite, as well as with the alien who resides with him.",
      "17": "Do not show partiality in judgment. Provide a hearing for the small and the great alike. Do not be motivated by fear of any person, because judgment belongs to God. Any case that is too difficult for you, bring it before me and I will hear it.”",
      "18": "So I gave you orders at that time about everything that you should do.",
      "19": "Then we journeyed from Horeb, and we walked through that whole vast and terrifying wilderness that you saw on the road to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God had commanded us to do. When we came to Kadesh Barnea,",
      "20": "I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.",
      "21": "Look now, the Lord your God has given you the land ahead of you. Go up, take possession of it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said to you. Do not be afraid and do not be overwhelmed.”",
      "22": "Then all of you approached me and said, “Let us send out some of our men so that they can scout the land for us and bring us a report about the route that we should take and the cities that we will reach.”",
      "23": "The plan seemed good to me, so I selected from you twelve men, one man from each tribe.",
      "24": "They set out and went up to the hill country and came to the area of the Valley of Eshcol and spied on it.",
      "25": "They took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it back to us and brought us a report that said, “The land that the Lord our God is giving us is good.”",
      "26": "Still you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the order of the Lord your God.",
      "27": "You complained in your tents and said, “Because the Lord hates us, he brought us out of the land of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us.",
      "28": "Where are we going? Our brothers have made our hearts melt by saying, ‘People there are stronger and taller than we are! There are large cities with fortified walls up to the skies! Also, we have seen the descendants of Anak there!’”",
      "29": "So I said to you, “Do not be overwhelmed and do not be afraid of them.",
      "30": "The Lord your God, who is going ahead of you, will fight for you, exactly as he did for you in Egypt, right before your very eyes,",
      "31": "and just as he did in the wilderness, where you saw that the Lord your God carried you as a man carries his son, on the entire way that you walked until you came to this place.”",
      "32": "Yet even with this, you did not believe the Lord your God,",
      "33": "who went ahead of you on the journey to search out a place for you to camp. He showed you the way that you should travel, by fire during the night and by a cloud during the day.",
      "34": "When the Lord heard the tone of your words, he was angry, and he swore an oath:",
      "35": "“Not one of these people from this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,",
      "36": "except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give the land on which he walked to him and his children, because he has fully followed the Lord.”",
      "37": "The Lord was angry with me too because of you. He said, “You also will not enter there.",
      "38": "Joshua son of Nun, who is standing before you, will enter there. Strengthen him, because he will lead Israel to possess it.",
      "39": "Your toddlers, who you said would become plunder of war, and your children, who today do not yet know good and evil, will enter there. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.",
      "40": "But you, turn around and travel into the wilderness toward the Red Sea.”",
      "41": "Then you answered me, “We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us to do.” So each man among you strapped on his weapons of war, and you thought it would be easy to go up to the hill country.",
      "42": "But the Lord instructed me: “Say to them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be among you to keep you from being struck down by your enemies.’”",
      "43": "So I spoke to you, but you did not listen. You rebelled against the command of the Lord and acted presumptuously by going up to the hill country anyway.",
      "44": "Then the Amorites living in the hill country went out to meet you. They pursued you like bees, and they struck you down in Seir all the way to Hormah.",
      "45": "Then you returned and you cried out before the Lord, but the Lord did not pay attention to the noise you made. He did not listen to you.",
      "46": "So you stayed in Kadesh many days—those well-known days that you stayed there."

      "1": "Then we turned and traveled toward the wilderness on the road to the Red Sea, as the Lord had told me, and we traveled for many days to get around the area of Mount Seir.",
      "2": "Then the Lord said to me,",
      "3": "“You have been traveling around this mountainous region long enough. Turn north",
      "4": "and command the people, ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who are living in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.",
      "5": "Do not wage war against them because I am not going to give you any of their land, not even an area the size of a footprint, because I have given the Mount Seir region to Esau as a possession.",
      "6": "You may buy food from them with money so you can eat, and you may purchase water from them with money so you can drink.",
      "7": "For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your trek through this vast wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you. You have not lacked anything.’”",
      "8": "So we passed by the territory of our brothers, the people of Esau, who were living in Seir. After leaving the Arabah Road, Elat, and Ezion Geber behind us, we turned and we traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab.",
      "9": "Then the Lord said to me, “Do not be hostile toward Moab and do not wage war against them in battle, because I am not going to give you any of their land as a possession, since I have given Ar to the people of Lot as a possession.”",
      "10": "(The Emites formerly lived in it, a strong, numerous people and tall like the Anakites.",
      "11": "They, like the Anakites, are also considered to be Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emites.",
      "12": "The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau took possession of their land and destroyed them from their midst. They settled there in their place, just as Israel did in the land that the Lord gave to them as their possession.)",
      "13": "Then the Lord told us: “Now get ready and cross the Zered Canyon.” So we crossed over the Zered Canyon.",
      "14": "The time that we traveled from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Zered Canyon was thirty-eight years, until that whole generation of fighting men were eliminated from the camp, just as the Lord had sworn to them.",
      "15": "Yes indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them to destroy them from the camp until they were eliminated.",
      "16": "Just as soon as all those fighting men were eliminated from the people by their death,",
      "17": "the Lord spoke to me:",
      "18": "“Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.",
      "19": "When you come near the people of Ammon, do not be hostile toward them and do not wage war against them, because I am not going to give any of the land of the people of Ammon to you as a possession, since I have given it to the people of Lot as a possession.”",
      "20": "(It also is considered to be the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived in it formerly, but the Ammonites call them Zamzumites.",
      "21": "They are a strong and numerous people and as tall as the Anakites. But the Lord destroyed the Rephaim from among the Ammonites. The Ammonites took possession of their land and lived there in their place.",
      "22": "The Lord had done the same things for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them, and they took possession of their land and settled there in their place and remain there to this day.",
      "23": "Now the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed the Avvites who were living in villages as far as Gaza and settled in their place.)",
      "24": "Then the Lord told us: “Get ready to travel and cross over the Arnon Canyon. See, I have given into your hands Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Start to take possession of it and wage war against him.",
      "25": "This very day I will begin to put dread and fear of you on the faces of the people everywhere under heaven, so that they will hear reports about you and they will tremble, and they will be shaking because of you.”",
      "26": "So I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedmoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with an offer of peace. I said,",
      "27": "“Let us pass through your land. We will proceed only on the road. We will not turn aside to the right or to the left.",
      "28": "You can sell us food in exchange for money so we can eat, and you can give us water in exchange for money so we can drink. Only let us pass through on foot,",
      "29": "as did the people of Esau living in Seir and the Moabites living in Ar, until we can cross over the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.”",
      "30": "But Sihon king of the Amorites was not willing to let us pass through on the road, because the Lord your God gave him a stubborn attitude by making his heart obstinate, in order to give him over into your hands, as is now the case today.",
      "31": "Then the Lord said to me, “Look now, I have begun to give you Sihon and his land. Start taking action to take possession of his land.”",
      "32": "Then Sihon and all of his people went out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.",
      "33": "The Lord our God gave him to us, and we struck him down, as well as his sons and all his people.",
      "34": "So we captured each of his cities at that time. We devoted each city to destruction, with the men, women, and children. We did not leave a survivor.",
      "35": "We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, as well as the spoils of war from the cities that we captured.",
      "36": "From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon Canyon, from the city that is in the canyon, all the way up to Gilead, there was not a city that was out of reach for us. The Lord our God gave us everything.",
      "37": "But it was only the land of the people of Ammon that you did not approach: the land along both sides of the Jabbok Canyon, the cities of the hill country, and everything that the Lord our God had forbidden us to take."

    "3": {
      "1": "Then we turned and went up on the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to confront us. He and all his people came for war at Edrei.",
      "2": "But the Lord said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, because I have given him into your hands, as well as all of his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”",
      "3": "So the Lord our God gave into our hands also Og king of Bashan and all his people. We struck them down until they had no survivor remaining.",
      "4": "So we took all of his cities at that time. There was not a city that we did not take from them—sixty cities, the whole area of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",
      "5": "All of these were fortified cities with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many small unwalled towns.",
      "6": "We devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon. There was a total destruction of every city, of men, women, and children,",
      "7": "but all of the cattle and the plunder of the cities we took as spoils for ourselves.",
      "8": "So at that time we took the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites who were east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Canyon to Mount Hermon.",
      "9": "(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, but the Amorites call it Senir.)",
      "10": "We took all the cities of the tableland and all of Gilead and all of Bashan, up to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.",
      "11": "(Only Og king of Bashan had remained from what was left of the Rephaim. His bed, a bed of iron, is it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon? Its length is thirteen feet, and its width is six feet, according to the standard measure.)",
      "12": "So we took possession of this land at that time. I gave to Reuben and to Gad the land starting at Aroer, which is at the Arnon Canyon, and half of the hill country of Gilead, as well as its cities.",
      "13": "I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, all the territory of Argob (all that part of Bashan is called the land of the Rephaim).",
      "14": "Jair, the descendant of Manasseh, took all the territory of Argob up to the border of the Geshurites and the Ma’acathites, and he named the villages of Bashan after himself, Havvoth Jair, as they are called to this day.",
      "15": "I gave Gilead to Makir.",

      "17": "Also the Arabah and the Jordan served as their border from the Sea of Kinneret to the Sea of the Arabah, that is, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.",
      "18": "I gave you a command at that time: “The Lord your God gave you this land as a possession. All of your soldiers, armed for battle, are to cross over before your brother Israelites.",
      "19": "Only your wives and your children and your livestock (I know that you have a lot of livestock) may stay in your cities that I have given you,",

      "21": "I also gave a command to Joshua at that time: “With your own eyes you have been observing everything that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms to which you are crossing.",
      "22": "Do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God himself is fighting for you.”",
      "23": "I also begged the favor of the Lord at that time:",
      "24": "“My Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand. Indeed, what god in heaven or on earth is there that has done anything like your works and your mighty deeds?",
      "25": "Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land on the other side of the Jordan—this good hill country and the mountains of Lebanon.”",
      "26": "But the Lord was furious with me because of you, and he did not listen to me but said to me, “Enough from you! Do not continue to speak to me anymore about this matter.",
      "27": "Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes toward the west and the north and the south and the east. Take a good look, because you will not be crossing over this Jordan.",
      "28": "But commission Joshua for duty and strengthen him and encourage him, because he will cross over in front of these people, and he will enable them to take possession of the land that you will only see.”",

      "10": "Tell about the day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb when the Lord said to me, “Bring the people near to me and I will make sure that they hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they are living in the land, and so that they may teach their children.”",
      "11": "So you drew near and you stood under the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire up to the very heavens. There was darkness, a thick cloud, and gloom.",
      "12": "Then the Lord your God spoke to you from the middle of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but you did not see a form. You only heard the sound.",
      "13": "He declared to you his covenant that he commanded you to carry out, namely, the Ten Commandments. Then he wrote them on two tablets of stone.",
      "14": "At that time the Lord commanded me to teach you the statutes and ordinances for you to carry out in the land that you are entering in order to occupy it.",

      "18": "an image of anything that creeps on the ground, or an image of any fish that swims in the water below the earth.",
      "19": "Beware so that you do not lift up your eyes to the heavens and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the vast army of the heavens, and you are lured away, and you bow down to them and worship them—things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the nations under all the heavens.",
      "20": "But you are the ones that the Lord has chosen and has brought out of the iron furnace of Egypt, to be a nation that is his possession, as is the case today.",
      "21": "But the Lord was angry with me because of your words, and he swore that I would not cross the Jordan and would not come into the good land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.",

      "25": "But when you become the father of children, and you have grandchildren, and you have grown old in the land, if you then act corruptly by making an idol of any form, and you do evil in the eyes of the Lord your God, provoking him to anger,",
      "26": "I today call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you, that you will most certainly perish quickly from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live many days in it, because you will most certainly be destroyed.",
      "27": "The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left as a people that are few in number among the nations where the Lord your God will force you to go.",
      "28": "There you will worship gods, the work of human hands, made of wood and stone—things that do not see or hear or eat or smell.",

      "30": "When you experience misery and all these things have happened to you in future days, then you will return to the Lord your God, and you will be obedient to his voice.",
      "31": "For the Lord your God is a compassionate God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant that he promised to your fathers with an oath.",
      "32": "So ask now about the former days, long before your time, beginning from the day when God created man on the earth. Search from one end of the heavens to the other. Has there ever been anything like this great event, or has anything like it ever been heard?",
      "33": "Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the middle of fire as you heard and yet continued to live?",
      "34": "Or has a god ever tried to go and take for himself a nation from inside another nation by tests, signs, and warnings, or by war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great awe-inspiring acts like all those that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt in front of your very eyes?",
      "35": "You yourselves were shown this so that you could know that the Lord—he is God! There is none except him alone.",
      "36": "He let you hear his voice from the heavens to discipline you, and on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words from the middle of the fire.",
      "37": "Yes, because he loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by the great power of his Presence,",
