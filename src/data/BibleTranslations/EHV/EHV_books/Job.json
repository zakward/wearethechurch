  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright, a man who feared God and turned away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys. He also had a very large retinue of servants. This man was the greatest of all the men of the East.",
      "4": "His sons would regularly arrange feasts, each one in his own house on his assigned day, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of the feast were complete, Job would send for them and consecrate them. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them. Job would say, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did this regularly.",
      "6": "There came a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came into their midst.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\nSatan answered the Lord, “From roaming the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "8": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and turns away from evil.”",
      "9": "Satan answered the Lord, “Is it without cause that Job fears God?",
      "10": "You have put a protective hedge around him and his household and everything that belongs to him, haven’t you? You have blessed the work of his hands. His livestock has spread throughout the land.",
      "11": "But just stretch out your hand and strike everything that is his, and he will certainly curse you to your face!”",
      "12": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then. Everything that he has is in your hand. But you may not stretch out your hand against the man himself.” So Satan left the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their oldest brother,",
      "14": "a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys were grazing nearby,",
      "15": "when the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They put the servants to death with the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "16": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the flocks and the servants and consumed them, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "17": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and plundered the camels and took them away. They put the servants to death with the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "18": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and were drinking wine in the house of their oldest brother.",
      "19": "Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed on the young people, and they died, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "20": "Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshipped.",
      "21": "Then he said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. May the name of the Lord be blessed.”",
      "22": "In all this, Job did not sin or blame God."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Another day arrived when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came into their midst.",
      "2": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\nSatan answered the Lord, “From roaming the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "3": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to destroy him for no reason.”",
      "4": "Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! A man will give all he has for his life.",
      "5": "But stretch out your hand and strike his bones and flesh, and he will certainly curse you to your face!”",
      "6": "The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hand, but preserve his life.”",
      "7": "Satan then went out from the presence of the Lord. He struck Job with very painful sores from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.",
      "8": "So Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”",
      "10": "But he said to her, “You are talking like a woman who lacks moral judgment. If we accept the good that comes from God, shouldn’t we also accept the bad?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.",
      "11": "Three friends of Job heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, and each of them came from his own homeland: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Na’amathite. They met together and went to sympathize with Job and to comfort him.",
      "12": "When they caught sight of Job from a distance, they did not recognize him. They raised their voices and wept. Each man tore his robe and tossed dust into the air and onto his head.",
      "13": "They sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Finally, Job opened his lips and cursed the day of his birth.",
      "2": "Job spoke up and said:",
      "3": "May the day of my birth perish,\nand the night when it was said, “A child has been conceived!”",
      "4": "As for that day, let it be darkness!\nMay God above have no concern for it.\nMay light not shine on it.",
      "5": "May darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it.\nMay a dark cloud settle over it.\nMay whatever blackens the day terrify it.",
      "6": "As for that night, may deep darkness take it away!\nMay it not be included among the days of the year\nor show up in the list of months.",
      "7": "Oh let that night be barren!\nMay no joyful shout be heard in it.",
      "8": "May those who curse days cast a spell on it,\nthose who are able to awaken Leviathan.",
      "9": "May its twilight stars be darkened.\nMay it wait hopefully for light but receive none.\nMay it never see the eyelids of dawn,",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,\nand it did not hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "Why did I not die at birth\nor pass away as I came from the womb?",
      "12": "Why did my mother’s knees receive me?\nWhy were her breasts there to nurse me?",
      "13": "For then I would be lying down peacefully.\nI would be sleeping and resting quietly",
      "14": "with the kings and counselors of the earth,\n        with those who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves,",
      "15": "with high officials who accumulated gold,\n        with those who filled their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,\nlike the infants who never see the light of day?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil.\nThere the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "There the prisoners are at ease together.\nThey no longer hear the voice of the slave driver.",
      "19": "There the small and great are alike,\nand the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "Why is light given to those weighed down with grief?\nWhy is life given to those whose spirit is bitter,",
      "21": "to those who yearn for death but it does not come,\n    though they dig for it more than for buried treasure,",
      "22": "to those who will be thrilled with happiness,\nthose who will celebrate when they reach the grave?",
      "23": "Why is light given to a man whose path is hidden,\nto one whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "Now my sighing takes the place of my daily bread.\nMy groans gush forth like water,",
      "25": "because what I feared has overwhelmed me,\nand that which I dreaded has come upon me.",
      "26": "I have no ease, no quiet, no rest.\nInstead, turmoil has come."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded:",
      "2": "If someone ventures to have a word with you, will you grow impatient?\nBut who can refrain from speaking up?",
      "3": "You yourself have instructed many,\nand you have strengthened weak hands.",
      "4": "Your words have raised up people who were stumbling,\nand you have given support to buckling knees.",
      "5": "But now that this has happened to you, you grow impatient.\nThis strikes you and you are disturbed.",
      "6": "Shouldn’t your piety give you confidence?\nDon’t your blameless ways give you reason to hope?",
      "7": "Now remember this:\nWho has ever perished if he was innocent?\nWhere were the upright ever erased?",
      "8": "This is what I have observed:\nThose who plow evil and sow trouble will reap the same.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish.\nBy the blast from his nostrils they come to an end.",
      "10": "The lion roars, and the fierce lion growls,\nbut the teeth of the young lion are broken.",
      "11": "The strong lion perishes from a lack of prey,\nand the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "A word was delivered to me secretly.\nMy ears caught a whisper of it.",
      "13": "In the middle of anxious thoughts arising from visions in the night,\nat the time when deep sleep falls upon people,",
      "14": "terror and trembling came over me\nand made all my bones tremble.",
      "15": "A spirit passed in front of my face.\nThe hair on my body stood on end.",
      "16": "A figure stood in front of me,\nbut I could not tell what it was.\nA form stood before my eyes,\nand I heard a quiet voice say,",
      "17": "“Can a person be righteous before God?\nCan a man be pure before his Maker?”",
      "18": "If God does not trust his own servants,\nif he charges his messengers with error,",
      "19": "how much more those who dwell in clay houses,\n    whose foundations are in the dust,\n    who are crushed more quickly than a moth!",
      "20": "From dawn to dusk they are smashed to pieces.\nThey perish forever, and no one even notices.",
      "21": "Won’t the ropes that hold up their tents be pulled up,\nso that they die without gaining wisdom?"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Call out! Is there anyone there to answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "It’s true, the fool is killed by resentment,\nand the gullible are put to death by jealousy.",
      "3": "I myself have seen a fool putting down roots,\nbut immediately I pronounced a curse on his home.",
      "4": "His children are far from safety.\nThey are crushed at the city gate without a defender.",
      "5": "His harvest is eaten by the hungry,\n    who snatch it away, even from among the thorns,\n    and the thirsty swallow his children’s wealth.",
      "6": "Disaster does not just spring up from the dust,\nnor does trouble sprout from the soil.",
      "7": "No, mankind is born for trouble as surely as flames fly upward.",
      "8": "But I want to appeal to God.\nI want to present my case to him.",
      "9": "He does great things that are beyond investigation,\nand miracles that are too many to be counted.",
      "10": "He provides rain for the earth.\nHe waters the fields in the countryside.",
      "11": "He raises the lowly to the heights,\nand he lifts those who mourn to safety.",
      "12": "He foils the plots of clever schemers,\n    so that their hands achieve no success.",
      "13": "He traps the wise in their schemes,\nand the plans of the devious come to a swift end.",
      "14": "By day they encounter darkness,\nand at noon they grope around as if it were night.",
      "15": "He saves the poor from mouths that cut like a sword\nand from the hand of the strong.",
      "16": "He does this so that the helpless will have hope,\nand injustice will shut its mouth.",
      "17": "Consider this:\nHow blessed is the man whom God corrects!\nDo not reject the discipline of the Almighty!",
      "18": "For though he may inflict wounds, he also bandages them.\nThough he may strike, his hands also heal.",
      "19": "From six calamities he will rescue you.\nIn seven no harm will touch you.",
      "20": "In famine he will redeem you from death,\nand in battle he will redeem you from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "You will be hidden from the lash of the tongue,\nand you will not be afraid of devastation when it comes.",
      "22": "You will laugh at devastation and hunger.\nYou will not be afraid of the wild animals of the countryside,",
      "23": "because there will be a covenant between you and the stones in the field,\nand the wild animals will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "You will know that your tent is secure,\nand when you inspect your property, you will find nothing missing.",
      "25": "You will know that your offspring will be many,\nand your descendants will be like grass from the earth.",
      "26": "You will come to the grave at a ripe old age,\n    like a stack of sheaves that is gathered in season.",

      "7": "I absolutely refuse to touch it.\nIt is no better than sickening food.",
