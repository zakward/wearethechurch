    "1": {
      "1": "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
      "2": "This is how it is written in the prophet Isaiah:\nLook, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nwho will prepare the way for you.",
      "3": "A voice of one calling out in the wilderness,\n“Prepare the way of the Lord.\nMake his paths straight.”",
      "4": "John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
      "5": "The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.",
      "6": "John was clothed in camel’s hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "He preached, “One more powerful than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals!",
      "8": "I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "Just as Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
      "11": "And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am well pleased with you.”",
      "12": "The Spirit immediately sent Jesus out into the wilderness.",
      "13": "He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels were serving him.",
      "14": "After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.",
      "15": "“The time is fulfilled,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near! Repent, and believe in the gospel.”",
      "16": "As Jesus was going along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, since they were fishermen.",
      "17": "Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”",
      "18": "Immediately they left their nets and followed him.",
      "19": "Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending the nets.",
      "20": "Immediately Jesus called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.",
      "21": "Then they went into Capernaum.\nOn the next Sabbath day, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
      "22": "They were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them as one who has authority and not as the experts in the law.",
      "23": "Just then there was a man with an unclean spirit in their synagogue. It cried out,",
      "24": "“What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
      "25": "Jesus rebuked the spirit, saying, “Be quiet! Come out of him!”",
      "26": "The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions, and after crying out with a loud voice, it came out of him.",
      "27": "Everyone was so amazed that they began to discuss this with each other. They said, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”",
      "28": "News about him spread quickly through all the region of Galilee.",
      "29": "They left the synagogue and went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.",
      "30": "Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever. Without delay they told Jesus about her.",
      "31": "He went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.",
      "32": "That evening, when the sun had set, the people kept bringing to him all who were sick and demon-possessed.",
      "33": "The whole town gathered at the door.",
      "34": "He healed many people who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.",
      "35": "Jesus got up early in the morning, while it was still dark, and went out. He withdrew to a solitary place and was praying there.",
      "36": "Simon and his companions searched for him,",
      "37": "and, when they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”",
      "38": "He told them, “Let’s go somewhere else, to the neighboring villages, so that I can preach there too. In fact, that is why I have come.”",
      "39": "Then he went throughout the whole region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.",
      "40": "A leper came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged him, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”",
      "41": "Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him. “I am willing,” he told him. “Be clean.”",
      "42": "Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was healed.",
      "43": "Then Jesus gave him a stern warning and immediately sent him away.",
      "44": "He told him, “See that you do not say anything to anyone. Instead go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifices for your cleansing that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”",
      "45": "But after the man left, he began to proclaim it widely. He spread the word so much that Jesus was no longer able to enter a town openly but stayed outside in deserted places. Yet people kept coming to him from all directions."

    "2": {
      "1": "When Jesus again entered Capernaum some days later, people heard that he was home.",
      "2": "So many people were gathered together that there was no more room, not even by the door, and he was speaking the word to them.",
      "3": "Some people came to him bringing a paralyzed man, carried by four men.",
      "4": "Since they could not bring the man to Jesus because of the crowd, they dug through the roof above where he was. When they had made an opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralyzed man was lying.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "But there were some experts in the law sitting there and thinking in their hearts,",
      "7": "“Why does this fellow speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”",
      "8": "Jesus immediately knew in his spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. He asked them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier: to tell the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your stretcher, and walk’?",
      "10": "But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralyzed man,",
      "11": "“I tell you, get up, take your stretcher, and go home.”",
      "12": "At once the man got up, picked up the stretcher, and went out in front of everyone. So they were all amazed and glorified God. They said, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
      "13": "Jesus went out again along the sea. The whole crowd went to him, and he taught them.",
      "14": "As he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him. And Levi got up and followed him.",
      "15": "Then when Jesus was reclining at a table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples because many of them also were following him.",
      "16": "When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why is he eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
      "18": "John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came and asked Jesus, “Why is it that John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples do not fast?”",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “The friends of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then on that day they will fast.",
      "21": "No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the patch shrinks, the new tears away from the old, and a worse tear is made.",
      "22": "No one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will pour out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.”",
      "23": "Once on a Sabbath day, Jesus was passing through the grain fields, and his disciples began to pick heads of grain as they walked along.",
      "24": "The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”",
      "25": "He replied to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry (he and his companions)?",
      "26": "He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for anyone to eat, except for the priests. He also gave some to his companions.”",
      "27": "Then Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "So the Son of Man is the Lord even of the Sabbath.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there with a withered hand.",
      "2": "They were watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day, so that they could accuse him.",
      "3": "He said to the man with the withered hand, “Step forward!”",
      "4": "Then he said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.",
      "5": "Then he looked around at them with anger, deeply grieved at the hardness of their hearts. He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored.",
      "6": "The Pharisees left and immediately began to conspire against Jesus with the Herodians, plotting how they might kill him.",
      "7": "Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples. A large crowd followed him from Galilee, Judea,",
      "8": "Jerusalem, Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, as well as from around Tyre and Sidon. A large crowd came to him when they heard all that he was doing.",
      "9": "He told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that the people would not crush him.",
      "10": "Since he had healed many people, all those who had illnesses were pressing forward to touch him.",
      "11": "Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him, crying out, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "But he warned them sternly that they should not tell who he was.",
      "13": "Jesus went up the mountain, summoned those he wanted, and they came to him.",
      "14": "He appointed twelve whom he designated apostles, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach",
      "15": "and to have authority to drive out demons.",
      "16": "He appointed the Twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;",
      "17": "then James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the nickname Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”;",
      "18": "also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus; finally, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.",
      "20": "They went into a house. A crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat a meal.",
      "21": "When his own people heard this, they went out to take control of him, because they were saying, “He is out of his mind.”",
      "22": "The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”",
      "23": "Jesus called them together and spoke to them in parables. “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.",
      "26": "And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished.",
      "27": "On the other hand, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he ties up the strong man first. Then he can plunder his house.",
      "28": "Amen I tell you: Everything will be forgiven people, their sins and whatever blasphemies they may speak.",
      "29": "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”",
      "30": "Jesus said this because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "Then his mother and his brothers arrived. While they were standing outside, they sent word to Jesus, calling for him.",
      "32": "A crowd was sitting around him. They began to tell him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”",
      "33": "He replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”",
      "34": "He looked at those who sat around him in a circle and he said, “Look, my mother and my brothers!",
      "35": "For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Another time Jesus began to teach by the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the sea. The whole crowd was on the seashore.",
      "2": "Then he taught them many things in parables. As he taught them, he said,",
      "3": "“Listen! There was a sower who went out to sow.",
      "4": "As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.",
      "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up right away because it did not have deep soil.",
      "6": "When the sun rose, it was scorched, and because it did not have much root, it withered.",
      "7": "Some seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, so it did not produce fruit.",
      "8": "Still other seed fell on good ground and yielded fruit, sprouting and growing and producing a crop: some thirty, some sixty, and some one hundred times as much as was sown.”",
      "9": "Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
      "10": "When Jesus was alone, those who were around him with the Twelve asked him about the parables.",
      "11": "He said to them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but everything comes in parables to those who are outside,",
      "12": "so that\nthey will certainly see but not perceive,\nand they will certainly hear but not understand.\nOtherwise, they might turn and be forgiven.”",
      "13": "Then he asked them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand any of the parables?",
      "14": "The sower sows the word.",
      "15": "These are the ones along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and immediately takes away the word that was sown in them.",
      "16": "Some are like the ones sown on rocky ground: as soon as they hear the word, they immediately welcome it with joy.",
      "17": "Yet since they have no root in themselves, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately fall away.",
      "18": "Still others are sown among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word,",
      "19": "but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth and desires for other things enter in and choke the word, so it becomes unfruitful.",
      "20": "But the ones sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, accept it, and produce fruit: some thirty, some sixty, and some one hundred times as much as was sown.”",
      "21": "He also said to them, “A lamp is not brought out to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it placed on a lampstand?",
      "22": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not come to light.",
      "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
      "24": "He went on to tell them, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you.",
      "25": "Yes, whoever has will be given more. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”",
      "26": "He said, “The kingdom of God is like this: A man scatters seed on the ground,",
      "27": "and while he sleeps and rises, night and day, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.",
      "28": "The ground produces fruit on its own: first the blade, then the head, then the full grain in the head.",
      "29": "When the crop is ready, he swings the sickle without delay, because the harvest has come.”",
      "30": "Then he said, “To what should we compare the kingdom of God? Or with what parable may we picture it?",
      "31": "It is like a mustard seed, which when sown on the ground is one of the smallest of all the seeds planted in the ground.",
      "32": "Yet when it is planted, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches so that the birds of the sky can nest under its shade.”",
      "33": "With many similar parables he continued to speak the word to them, as much as they were able to hear.",
      "34": "He did not speak to them without a parable. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.",
      "35": "On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”",
      "36": "After leaving the crowd behind, the disciples took him along in the boat, just as he was. Other small boats also followed him.",
      "37": "A great windstorm arose, and the waves were splashing into the boat, so that the boat was quickly filling up.",
      "38": "Jesus himself was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and said, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to drown?”",
      "39": "Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind stopped, and there was a great calm.",
      "40": "He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still lack faith?”",
      "41": "They were filled with awe and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They went to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes.",
      "2": "As soon as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs to meet him.",
      "3": "The man lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.",
      "4": "For he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he pulled the chains apart and broke the shackles in pieces. Nobody had the strength to subdue him.",
      "5": "Night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was constantly crying out and cutting himself with stones.",
      "6": "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down in front of him.",
      "7": "He cried out with a loud voice, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you to swear by God not to torment me.”",
      "8": "For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”",
      "9": "Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\n“My name is Legion,” he replied, “because we are many.”",
      "10": "He begged Jesus repeatedly that he would not send them out of the region.",
      "11": "There was a large herd of pigs there feeding on the hillside.",
      "12": "The demons begged him, “Send us to the pigs so we may enter them.”",
      "13": "Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits went out and entered the pigs. Then the herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.",
      "14": "Those who were feeding the pigs ran and reported this in the city and the countryside.\nPeople came to see what had happened.",
      "15": "When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.",
      "16": "Those who had seen it described for these people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and they told them about the pigs.",
      "17": "They began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.",
      "18": "As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to stay with Jesus.",
      "19": "But Jesus would not let him. Instead, he told him, “Go home to your people, and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you.”",
      "20": "The man left and began to proclaim in the Decapolis everything Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.",
      "21": "When Jesus had again crossed over in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him near the sea.",
      "22": "Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet",
      "23": "and repeatedly pleaded with him, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.”",
      "24": "Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following him, pressing tightly against him.",
      "25": "A certain woman who was there had a discharge of blood for twelve years.",
      "26": "She had suffered much under the care of many physicians and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.",
      "27": "When she heard what was being said about Jesus, she went up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe.",
      "28": "She said, “If I just touch his robe, I will be healed.”",
      "29": "Immediately her flow of blood stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.",
      "30": "At that moment, Jesus knew that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my robe?”",
      "31": "His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing tightly against you and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’”",
      "32": "Nevertheless he kept looking around to see who had done this.",
      "33": "The woman was trembling with fear since she knew what had happened to her. She came forward, fell down in front of him, and told him the whole truth.",
      "34": "He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed of your suffering.”",
      "35": "While he was still speaking, people from the synagogue ruler’s house arrived, saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?”",
      "36": "But when Jesus heard this report, he told the synagogue ruler, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe.”",
      "37": "He did not allow anyone to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.",
      "38": "They went into the house of the synagogue ruler, and Jesus saw a commotion with people weeping and wailing loudly.",
      "39": "When he entered, he said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.”",
      "40": "They laughed at him. But after he put everyone out, he took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him and went in where the child was.",
      "41": "Grasping the hand of the child, he said to her, “Talitha, koum!” (When translated, that means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!”)",
      "42": "Immediately the little girl stood up and began to walk around. (She was twelve years old.) They were completely and utterly amazed.",
      "43": "Then he gave them strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and he told them to give her something to eat."

    "6": {
      "1": "Jesus left there and went to his hometown. His disciples followed him.",
      "2": "When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were amazed. They asked, “Where did this man learn these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to this man? How is it that miracles such as these are performed by his hands?",
      "3": "Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.",
      "4": "Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own house.”",
      "5": "He could not do any miracles there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.",
      "6": "He was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.",
      "7": "Jesus called the Twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority over the unclean spirits.",
      "8": "He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their money belts.",
      "9": "They were to put on sandals but not to wear two coats.",
      "10": "He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area.",
      "11": "Any place that will not receive you or listen to you, as you leave there, shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them.”",
      "12": "They went out and preached that people should repent.",
      "13": "They also drove out many demons. They anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.",
      "14": "King Herod heard about this because Jesus’ name had become well known. Herod was saying, “John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead! That is why these powers are at work in him.”",
      "15": "But others were saying, “He is Elijah.” Still others were saying, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”",
      "16": "When Herod heard this, he said, “This is John, the man I beheaded. He was raised.”",
      "17": "For it was Herod who had sent men to arrest John. He had him bound in prison because Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.",
      "18": "Indeed, John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”",
      "19": "Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to put him to death, but she could not,",
      "20": "because Herod feared John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, so he kept him safe. When Herod listened to John, he was perplexed in many ways, yet he gladly kept listening to him.",
      "21": "An opportune day came when it was Herod’s birthday. He gave a banquet for his nobles, the military officers, and the prominent men of Galilee.",
