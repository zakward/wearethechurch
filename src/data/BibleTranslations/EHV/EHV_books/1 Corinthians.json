      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!",
      "4": "I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus.",
      "5": "You were enriched in him in every way, in all your speaking and all your knowledge,",
      "6": "because the testimony about Christ was established in you.",
      "7": "As a result you do not lack any gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "He will also keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful, who called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.",
      "10": "Brothers, I am making an appeal to you using the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I ask that you all express the same view and not have any divisions among you, but that you be joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.",
      "11": "For the news I heard about you, my brothers, from members of Chloe’s household, is that there are rivalries among you.",
      "12": "What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”",
      "13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?",
      "14": "I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "so that no one can say that I baptized you into my own name.",
      "16": "(I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides them, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)",
      "17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel—not with the wisdom used in speeches, so that the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.",
      "18": "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.",
      "19": "In fact, it is written:\nI will destroy the wisdom of the wise;\nthe intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nothing.",
      "20": "Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Jewish law? Where is the probing thinker of the present age? Has God not shown that the wisdom of this world is foolish?",
      "21": "Indeed, since the world through its wisdom did not know God, God in his wisdom decided to save those who believe, through the foolishness of the preached message.",
      "22": "Yes, Jews ask for signs, Greeks desire wisdom,",
      "23": "but we preach Christ crucified—which is offensive to Jews and foolishness to Greeks,",
      "24": "but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "We preach Christ crucified, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
      "26": "For example, consider your call, brothers. Not many of you were wise from a human point of view, not many were powerful, and not many were born with high status.",
      "27": "But God chose the foolish things of the world to put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world to put to shame the things that are strong,",
      "28": "and God chose the lowly things of the world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to do away with the things that are,",
      "29": "so that no one may boast before God.",
      "30": "But because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us the wisdom from God, namely, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption.",
      "31": "God did this so that, just as it is written, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”"

    "2": {
      "1": "As for me, brothers, when I came to you, I did not come with superior speech or wisdom in order to proclaim to you the testimony of God.",
      "2": "For I had no intention of knowing anything among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",
      "3": "I came to you in weakness, in fear, and with much trembling.",
      "4": "My message and my preaching were not marked by persuasive words of human wisdom, but by a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,",
      "5": "so that your faith would not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.",
      "6": "Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature, but it is not a wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are being reduced to nothing.",
      "7": "Instead we speak God’s wisdom that has been hidden in mystery—before the ages, God foreordained that this wisdom would result in our glory.",
      "8": "None of the rulers of this world knew it. (If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.)",
      "9": "But as it is written:\nWhat no eye has seen and no ear has heard\nand no human mind has conceived—\nthat is what God has prepared for those who love him.",
      "10": "But God revealed it to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.",
      "11": "Indeed, who among men knows a man’s thoughts except the man’s spirit within him? So also, no one else knows God’s thoughts except God’s Spirit.",
      "12": "What we received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might know the blessings freely given to us by God.",
      "13": "We also speak about these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual truths with spiritual words.",
      "14": "However, an unspiritual person does not accept the truths taught by God’s Spirit, because they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually evaluated.",
      "15": "But the spiritual person evaluates all things, and he himself is evaluated by no one.",
      "16": "Indeed, “Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who will instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ."

      "2": "I fed you with milk, not solid food, because you were not yet ready. Why, even now you are still not ready,",
      "3": "because you are still people who are following the flesh. Indeed, insofar as jealousy, strife, and factions have a place among you, are you not people who are following the flesh? Are you not behaving in a merely human way?",
      "4": "When one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not being merely human?",
      "5": "What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are ministers through whom you believed, and each served as the Lord gave him his role.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.",
      "7": "So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but it is God who causes the growth.",
      "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters are united, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
      "9": "For God is the one whom we serve as coworkers, and you are God’s field, God’s building.",
      "10": "In keeping with the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder, I laid a foundation, and someone else is building on it. But let each person be careful how he builds on it.",
      "11": "In fact, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "But if anyone is building on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
      "13": "each person’s work will become evident. The Day will make it plain, because it is going to be revealed in fire, and the fire will test each person’s work to show what sort of work it is.",
      "14": "If what someone has built remains, he will receive a reward.",
      "15": "If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but it will be like an escape through fire.",
      "16": "Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and that is what you are.",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may become wise.",
      "19": "To be sure, the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,”",
      "20": "and again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise; he knows that it is worthless.”",
      "21": "Therefore let no one boast about men. For all things belong to you—",
      "22": "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All things belong to you,",
      "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."

      "2": "In this connection, moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.",
      "3": "But it is a trivial matter to me if I am evaluated by you or by a day in a human court. Why, I do not even evaluate myself.",
      "4": "I do not in fact know of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this; rather, the one who evaluates me is the Lord.",
      "5": "Therefore judge nothing ahead of time, until the Lord comes. He will bring to light whatever is hidden in darkness and also reveal the intentions of hearts. Then there will be praise for each person from God.",
      "6": "Brothers, I turned these things into a lesson using myself and Apollos as examples. I did this for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not be arrogant, favoring one person over the other.",
      "7": "For who makes you so special? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?",
      "8": "Oh, you are already filled! You have already become rich! You have begun to reign without us! If only that were really true, so that we could reign with you!",
      "9": "For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, in the lowliest position, like men sentenced to death, because we have been made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people.",
      "10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak—but you are so strong! You are honored! But we are despised.",
      "11": "At the present we still hunger and thirst and lack proper clothing. We are treated roughly, and we have no settled place to live in.",
      "12": "We toil, working with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we bless. When persecuted, we endure.",
      "13": "When slandered, we speak kind words. We have been treated like the world’s garbage, like everyone’s trash, right up to the present time.",
      "14": "I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my dear children.",
      "15": "Indeed, even if you would have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you would not have many fathers. I say this, because in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.",
      "16": "I urge you, therefore, be imitators of me.",
      "17": "That is why I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dearly loved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "Some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.",
      "19": "But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out about the power, not the talk, of those who are arrogant.",
      "20": "For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk, but in power.",
      "21": "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"

      "3": "Even though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and as one who is present, I have already decided about the man who has done such a thing.",
      "4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit is there, along with the power of our Lord Jesus,",

      "7": "Purge out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, just as you are unleavened. For our Passover lamb has been sacrificed, namely, Christ!",
      "8": "So let us keep celebrating the festival, not with old yeast, not with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "9": "When I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with the sexually immoral,",
      "10": "I did not at all mean the sexually immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world.",
      "11": "But in this situation, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother if he is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.",
      "12": "For what business is it of mine to judge people outside the church? Do you not judge those inside?",

      "4": "So if you have lawsuits involving matters of this life, do you appoint those people as your judges whom the church considers of no account?",
      "5": "I say this to make you feel ashamed. Is it really the case that there is not one wise man among you who would be able to decide a dispute between his brothers?",
      "6": "Instead, brother sues brother, and that in front of unbelievers!",
      "7": "The fact that you have lawsuits with one another is already a complete failure on your part. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?",
      "8": "Instead, you yourselves do the wronging and defrauding, and you do it to your brothers!",
      "9": "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor males who have sex with males,",

      "11": "(but if she does leave, she is to remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband is not to divorce his wife.",
      "12": "But I, not the Lord, say to the rest: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to go on living with him, he is not to divorce her.",
      "13": "If any woman has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to go on living with her, she is not to divorce her husband.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified in connection with his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified in connection with her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.",
      "15": "But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases, and God has called us to live in peace.",

      "21": "Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it bother you. But if you are able to become free, take advantage of it.",
      "22": "For the slave who was called to be in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person. Likewise, the free person who was called is Christ’s slave.",

      "24": "Brothers, let each person remain before God in the situation he was in when he was called.",

      "27": "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you unattached? Do not seek a wife.",

      "31": "and those who use the world, as if not getting any use out of it. For the way of life that belongs to this world is passing away.",
      "32": "I would like you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord and thinks about how to please the Lord.",
      "33": "But the married man is concerned about the things of the world and thinks about how to please his wife,",
      "34": "and so he is divided. The unmarried woman and the virgin are concerned about the things of the Lord, so as to be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world and thinks about how to please her husband.",
      "35": "I am saying this for your own benefit, not to impose a restriction, but to encourage honorable, undistracted devotion to the Lord.",
      "36": "But if someone thinks he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if his feelings are strong and it seems necessary, he should do what he desires. It is not a sin. They should marry.",
