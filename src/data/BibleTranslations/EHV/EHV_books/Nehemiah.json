      "1": "The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah.\nIn the month of Kislev of the twentieth year, I was in Susa, the citadel.",
      "2": "Hanani, one of my brothers, came to me with men from Judah. I asked them about the remnant of the Jews, who had survived the captivity and had escaped from it, and about Jerusalem.",
      "3": "They said to me, “The survivors from the captivity who are there in the province are in great misery and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned.”",
      "4": "When I heard about these things, I sat down and wept. I mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of Heaven.",
      "5": "I said:\nPlease, Lord, the God of Heaven, the great and awe-inspiring God, who preserves the covenant and faithfulness for those who love him and keep his commands:",
      "6": "Let your ear be attentive and your eyes be open as you hear the prayer of your servant today, which I am now praying before you day and night, concerning the Israelites, who are your servants. I am also confessing the sins of the people of Israel that we committed against you. I and my father’s house have also sinned.",
      "7": "We have acted very corruptly against you, and we have not kept the commands, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that you commanded Moses your servant.",
      "8": "Please remember the command you gave to Moses your servant when you said, “If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples.",
      "9": "But when you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even if you have been scattered to the end of heaven, from there I will gather them, and I will bring them to the place where I have chosen to make my name dwell.”",
      "10": "They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed with your great power and your mighty hand.",
      "11": "Please, my Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayers of your servants who are delighted to revere your name. Make your servant successful today, and give him mercy in this man’s presence.\nI was cupbearer to the king."

      "1": "In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, wine was being served to the king, and I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence,",
      "2": "so the king said to me, “Why do you look sad, since you are not sick? This must be sadness in your heart.”\nThen I was very much afraid.",
      "3": "I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why shouldn’t I look sad when the city, the place of my ancestors’ tombs, lies in ruins, and its gates have been consumed by fire?”",
      "4": "Then the king said to me, “What do you want?”\nSo I prayed to the God of Heaven,",
      "5": "and I said to the king, “If it seems good to the king, and if you look upon your servant with favor, then send me to Judah, to the city where my ancestors’ tombs are, and let me rebuild it.”",
      "6": "The king said to me, while the queen was sitting next to him, “How long will your journey be and when will you return?”\nThe king was pleased to send me, so I gave him a definite time.",
      "7": "I also said to the king, “If it seems good to the king, please give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will grant me safe passage through that province until I come to Judah,",
      "8": "also a letter to Asaph, superintendent of the king’s forest, so that he will give me lumber to lay beams for the gates of the citadel of the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” The king gave them to me, because the good hand of my God was upon me.",
      "9": "Then I came to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I gave them the king’s letters. The king had sent army officers and cavalry with me.",
      "10": "When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very upset that a man had come to seek the welfare of the Israelites.",
      "11": "So I arrived at Jerusalem and was there for three days.",
      "12": "At that time I got up in the middle of the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what God had placed into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.",
      "13": "At night I went out through the Valley Gate and went toward the vicinity of the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate. I began inspecting the walls of Jerusalem, which had been breached, and its gates, which had been consumed by fire.",
      "14": "Then I crossed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal that I was riding to get through.",
      "15": "So I kept going up the valley and inspecting the wall during the night. Then I turned around and went back the same way and came in through the Valley Gate.",
      "16": "The officials did not know where I had gone and what I was doing. I had not yet told the Jews—the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest of the people who would be doing the work.",
      "17": "So I said to them, “You see the very bad situation we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned. Come, let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be disgraced.”",
      "18": "Then I told them that the hand of my God had been good to me, and I also told them the words the king had said to me.\nThey said, “Let’s get up and rebuild!” Then they encouraged each other for this good work.",
      "19": "When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they ridiculed us and held us in contempt. They said, “What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”",
      "20": "I responded to them by saying, “The God of Heaven will make us successful. We, his servants, will rise up and rebuild. But you have no portion or right or heritage in Jerusalem.”"

      "1": "When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, it infuriated him, and he became very angry. He ridiculed the Jews",
      "2": "and said in front of his allies and the army of Samaria, “What are those pathetic Jews doing? Will they restore it by themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in one day? Will they refurbish the stones that came from the piles of rubble that have been burned?”",
      "3": "Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him. He said, “Whatever they are building, if even a fox climbed on it, it would break apart the wall made from their stones.”",
      "4": "Listen, O our God, because we are an object of contempt. Turn their ridicule back on their own heads. Hand them over as plunder in a land of captivity.",
      "5": "Do not cover over their guilt, and may their sin not be blotted out before you, because they have provoked your anger in the presence of the builders.",
      "6": "So we built the wall, and the entire wall was completed, up to half its height, because the people were determined to do it.",
      "7": "Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the repair of Jerusalem’s walls had progressed and the breaches had begun to be filled, they were infuriated.",
      "8": "So all of them conspired to come to attack Jerusalem and to throw it into confusion.",
      "9": "However, we prayed to our God, and because of the enemies, we posted a guard over the builders day and night.",
      "10": "Then the people of Judah said, “The strength of those bearing the burden is failing. There is so much rubble. We will not be able to build the wall!”",
      "11": "Then our adversaries said, “They will not know about it or realize what we are doing, until we come among them and kill them and bring the work to a halt.”",
      "12": "When the Jews who lived near them came, they repeatedly told us, “No matter which way you turn, they will be upon us.”",
      "13": "So I stationed people behind the wall at the lowest places, at its open spots. I stationed the people by clans with their swords, spears, and bows.",
      "14": "Then I looked and got up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and fearsome. So fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”",
      "15": "When our enemies heard that their plan was known to us and that God had frustrated their strategy, all of us returned to the wall, each man to his own work.",
      "16": "From that day on, half of the young men who were serving under me were doing the work, and half of them were holding shields, spears, and bows and wearing armor. The officers were stationed behind the whole house of Judah.",
      "17": "The people who were building the wall and those who were carrying the materials for building were doing their work with one hand, while the other hand held a weapon.",
      "18": "As they built, the builders were armed, each man with his sword on his hip. The man who sounded the ram’s horn was next to me.",
      "19": "Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “There is a lot of work, and it is spread out, and we are separated along the wall—all the people are far away from each other.",
      "20": "Wherever you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, gather with us at that spot. Our God will fight for us.”",
      "21": "So we continued to work with half of the people holding spears, from the crack of dawn until the stars came out.",
      "22": "Also at that time I said to the people, “Let every man and his servant spend the night in Jerusalem. They will serve as a guard for us at night, and in the daytime they will work.”",
      "23": "Neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who were behind me—none of us took off our clothes. Each man had his weapon in his hand, even when getting a drink of water."

      "1": "Now there was a great outcry by the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.",
      "2": "There were those who were saying, “We and our sons and our daughters are many! We need to acquire grain so that we can eat and stay alive.”",
      "3": "There were others who were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and houses so that we can acquire grain during the famine.”",
      "4": "There were others who were saying, “We borrowed money to pay the royal tax on our fields and vineyards.",
      "5": "Although our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen, and our children are as good as their children, we must subject our sons and our daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we have no power to prevent it, since our fields and vineyards belong to others.”",
      "6": "It infuriated me when I heard their outcry and these words.",
      "7": "My heart guided me, and I accused the nobles and the officials. I said to them, “Each of you is loaning money at interest to his brother Israelite.”\nI called for a large meeting to deal with them.",
      "8": "I said to them, “As much as possible, we have bought back our fellow Judeans who have been sold to the Gentiles, and yet, you sell your countrymen so that they can be resold to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say.",
      "9": "So I said, “What you are doing is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God because of the ridicule from the Gentiles, who are our enemies?",
      "10": "In addition, I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and grain. I urge you. Let’s abandon the practice of charging this interest.",
      "11": "I urge you. Today give them back their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, their homes, and the money they were charged as interest, also the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil for which you have been charging them.”",
      "12": "They said, “We will give it back, and we will not seek anything else from them. In this way we will do what you say.”\nSo I called the priests and made them swear to act according to this promise.",
      "13": "I also shook out the folds of my garment and said, “In this way may God shake out from his home and from his property every man who does not keep this promise. May he be shaken out and emptied in this way.”\nThe entire assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the Lord. Then the people kept this promise.",
      "14": "In addition, from the day that he appointed me to be the governor of the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years—I and my brothers did not eat the governor’s food allowance.",
      "15": "However, the previous governors who served before me had placed a heavy burden on the people. They took food and wine from them—valued at forty silver shekels. Even the lower officials lorded over the people. But because of the fear of God, I did not do this.",
      "16": "In addition, I dedicated myself to the work on this wall (although we had acquired no land), and all of my servants were gathered there for the work.",
      "17": "Moreover, at my table there were one hundred fifty Judeans and officials, and others who came to us from the nations around us.",
      "18": "Whatever was prepared for each day was at my expense: one ox, six choice sheep, and some birds, and every ten days plenty of every kind of wine. But even with this, I still did not requisition the governor’s food allowance, because the required service weighed heavily on this people.",
      "19": "Remember me, my God, for good, considering all that I have done for this people."

    "6": {
      "1": "When it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and there was no breach left in it (although at that time I had not installed doors in the gates),",
      "2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me: “Come, let’s meet together in Kephirim in the Plain of Ono.” (However, they were planning to harm me.)",
      "3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am working on an important project, and I am not able to come down. Why should the project stop while I leave it and come down to you?”",
      "4": "They sent messages like this to me four times, and I answered them that same way each time.",
      "5": "Then Sanballat sent his servant to me with a message like this for a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.",
      "6": "In it was written, “It is rumored among the nations, and Gashmu also says that you and the Jews are planning to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you will be their king.",
      "7": "You have also set up prophets to make a proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘A king is in Judah.’ Now reports like these will be heard by the king. So now come, let us consult with one another.”",
      "8": "So I sent a reply to him: “These things that you are saying have not been done, since you are simply making them up.”",
      "9": "So all of them were trying to intimidate us, thinking, “Their hands will grow weary of the work, and it will not be finished.”\nSo now, strengthen my hands!",
      "10": "Then I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. (He was restricted.) He said, “Let’s meet at the house of God in the middle of the temple. Let’s close the doors of the temple, since they are coming to kill you—at night they are coming to kill you.”",
      "11": "I said, “Should a man like me flee? Should someone like me go to the temple to save my life? I won’t go!”",
      "12": "I realized that God had not sent him, but he had spoken the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
      "13": "For this purpose he was hired—to make me afraid so that I would do this and sin. Then they would have given me a bad reputation, so that they could discredit me.",
      "14": "My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were trying to intimidate me.",
      "15": "So the wall was finished in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.",
      "16": "As all our enemies heard about it, all the nations that were around us became afraid and lost their confidence. They knew that this work had been accomplished by our God.",
      "17": "Furthermore, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah were coming to them,",
      "18": "because many in Judah were bound to him by oath because he was the son-in-law of Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.",
      "19": "They were also talking about his good deeds in my presence, and they were reporting my words to him. Tobiah was sending letters to try to intimidate me."

      "3": "I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem should not be left open until the heat of the day, but while the guards are still on duty, they are to shut the doors and secure them. Appoint guards from the residents of Jerusalem, some at their guard posts and some in front of their houses.”",
      "4": "Now the city was wide open and spacious, but there were few people in it, and no houses were being built.",
      "5": "So my God placed into my heart a plan to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people so they could be enrolled by genealogy. I found the genealogical record of those who were the first to come up from Babylon. I found this written in it:",
