      "2": "Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upstairs room in Samaria, and he was injured. So he sent messengers and told them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will survive this injury.”",
      "3": "But an angel of the Lord said to Elijah from Tishbe, “Get up. Go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, ‘Is there no God in Israel, so that you are going to seek out Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?",
      "4": "Therefore, this is what the Lord says. You will not get up from the bed you have gotten into. You will certainly die.’” So Elijah went.",
      "5": "The messengers returned to the king, so he said to them, “Why have you come back?”",
      "6": "They told him, “A man came up to meet us and told us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him: This is what the Lord says. Is there no God in Israel, so that you are sending men to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, you will not get up from the bed you have gotten into. You will surely die.’”",
      "7": "He said to them, “How would you describe the man who came up to meet you and said these words to you?”",
      "8": "They told him, “He was dressed in clothing made of hair, with a leather belt tied around his waist.”\nThen Ahaziah said, “That was Elijah from Tishbe!”",
      "9": "So he sent a captain of fifty men to Elijah. He went up to him, and there Elijah was, sitting on top of a hill. Then the captain said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’”",
      "10": "Then Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, let fire fall from the sky and consume you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from the sky and consumed him and his fifty men.",
      "11": "Then the king sent another captain of fifty men to him, and the captain said, “Man of God, this is what the king says: ‘Come down at once!’”",
      "12": "Elijah answered, “If I am a man of God, then let fire fall from the sky and consume you and your fifty men!” Then the fire of God fell from the sky and consumed him and his fifty men.",
      "13": "So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. The third captain went and got down on his knees before Elijah and begged for mercy. He said to Elijah, “Man of God, let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your eyes.",
      "14": "Look, fire from the sky fell and consumed the first two captains and their companies of fifty men. But now, let the lives of your servants be precious.”",
      "15": "Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not fear him.” So Elijah stood up and went down with him to the king.",
      "16": "Then Elijah told the king, “This is what the Lord says. Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron—Is there no God in Israel to inquire of?—therefore, you will not get up from the bed you have gotten into. You will certainly die.”",
      "17": "Then he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah did not have a son, Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.",
      "18": "As for the rest of Ahaziah’s acts which he did, are they not written in the annals of the kings of Israel?"

      "1": "When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah was traveling with Elisha from Gilgal.",
      "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Bethel.”\nBut Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.",
      "3": "The sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master away from you?”\nThen he said, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”",
      "4": "Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here because the Lord has sent me to Jericho.”\nBut he said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went to Jericho.",
      "5": "Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master away from you?”\nHe said, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”",
      "6": "Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here because the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.”\nBut he said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.",
      "7": "Then fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood and watched them from a distance, while the two of them were standing at the Jordan.",
      "8": "Elijah took his cloak, folded it together, and struck the water. The water divided to the right and to the left. Then the two of them crossed on dry land.",
      "9": "When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask me for whatever I can do for you before I am taken from you.”\nThen Elisha said, “Let there be a double portion of your spirit on me.”",
      "10": "He said, “You have asked for a difficult thing. If you see me being taken from you, it will surely be yours. But if not, then it will not.”",
      "11": "While they were walking and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire came and separated them. So Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.",
      "12": "Elisha was watching and crying out, “My father! My father! Israel’s chariot and its charioteers!” Then he did not see him anymore. He grabbed his clothing, and he ripped it into two pieces.",
      "13": "Then he picked up Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen from him. He returned and stood at the edge of the Jordan.",
      "14": "He took Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen from him, and he struck the water and said, “Where now is the Lord, the God of Elijah? Yes, where is he?” As soon as he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left so that Elisha could cross.",
      "15": "When the sons of the prophets, who were watching him from Jericho, saw this, they said, “Elijah’s spirit is resting on Elisha.” They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.",
      "16": "They said to him, “Look, here are your servants, fifty strong men. Please, let them go and search for your master in case the Spirit of the Lord lifted him up and then set him down on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.”\nBut he said, “Don’t send them.”",
      "17": "But they urged him to the point of embarrassment, so he said, “Send them.” So they sent the fifty men. They searched for three days, but they did not find him.",
      "18": "When they returned to Elisha, he was staying in Jericho. He said to them, “Didn’t I say to you, ‘Don’t go’?”",
      "19": "Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Look, the site of the city is good, as my lord can see, but the water is bad, and the land deprives people of children.”",
      "20": "So he said, “Bring me a new dish and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.",
      "21": "Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt in. He said, “This is what the Lord says. I have healed this water. No longer will death or loss of children come from it.”",
      "22": "So the water has remained healed to this day, according to the word which Elisha spoke.",
      "23": "He went up from there to Bethel. While he was going up on the road, young boys came out from the city and mocked him. They said, “Go up, baldy! Go up, baldy!”",
      "24": "So he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two female bears came out of the woods, and they tore forty-two boys to pieces.",
      "25": "From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel, and then he returned to Samaria."

      "1": "Now Jehoram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he ruled as king for twelve years.",
      "2": "He did evil in the eyes of the Lord but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred memorial stones for Baal which his father had made,",
      "3": "but he clung to the sins which Jeroboam son of Nebat caused Israel to commit. He did not turn from them.",
      "4": "Mesha king of Moab raised sheep. He brought tribute to the king of Israel consisting of one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.",
      "5": "When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "So King Jehoram went out from Samaria at that time, and he mobilized all Israel.",
      "7": "He sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to wage war against Moab?”\nJehoshaphat replied, “I will go with you. I am like you. My people are like your people. My horses are like your horses.”",
      "8": "Then Jehoshaphat asked, “By what road should we go up?”\nJehoram answered, “By the road through the wilderness of Edom.”",
      "9": "Then the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom marched for seven days by a roundabout way. There was no water for the army or for the animals which were along with them.",
      "10": "Then the king of Israel said, “This is terrible! The Lord has summoned these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab!”",
      "11": "But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire of the Lord through him?”\nOne of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”",
      "12": "Then Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is in him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to meet him.",
      "13": "Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do we have in common? Go to your father’s prophets and your mother’s prophets!”\nThen the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the Lord has summoned these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”",
      "14": "Then Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord of Armies lives, before whom I stand, if I did not respect the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or notice you.",
      "15": "But now bring me a musician.”\nWhile the musician was playing, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.",
      "16": "He said, “This is what the Lord says. Make this valley full of ditches.",
      "17": "Yes, this is what the Lord says: You will not see wind. You will not see rain. But this valley will be full of water and you will drink—you and your livestock and your animals.",
      "18": "This is nothing in the eyes of the Lord. He will also give Moab into your hands.",
      "19": "You will destroy all their fortified cities and all their main towns. You will cut down every good tree. You will stop up every spring of water. You will ruin every good plot of land with stones.”",
      "20": "In the morning, at the time for the regular offering, suddenly there was water coming from the direction of Edom. So the land was full of water.",
      "21": "All Moab heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. They summoned all those who were old enough to strap on a sword and took their stand at the border.",
      "22": "They got up early in the morning as the rising sun was shining on the water. When the Moabites saw the water from a distance, it was red like blood.",
      "23": "They said, “Look! Blood! The kings fought and killed each other. Now, get to the plunder, Moab!”",
      "24": "So they went to Israel’s camp, but Israel rose up and struck Moab, and the Moabites fled from them. Israel advanced against them to strike down Moab.",
      "25": "Israel tore down the cities. Each man threw a stone on every good plot of land and covered all of them. They stopped up every spring, and they cut down every good tree. Only in Kir Hareseth were the stones left standing. Then the troops armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it.",
      "26": "When the king of Moab saw that he was losing the battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they were not able to do it.",
      "27": "So he took his firstborn son, who would have become king in his place, and he offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. There was great anger against Israel, so they withdrew from him and returned to their own country."

      "1": "The wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead. You know that your servant feared the Lord. But now the moneylender is coming to take my two sons as slaves.”",
      "2": "Then Elisha said to her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”\nShe said, “Your servant has nothing at all in the house except a jar of olive oil.”",
      "3": "He told her, “Go and ask all your neighbors for jars—empty jars. Don’t ask for only a few.",
      "4": "Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Then pour oil into all the jars. When each one is full, set it aside.”",
      "5": "So she went and shut the door to her house behind her and her sons. They brought the jars, and she poured.",
      "6": "When a jar was filled, she said to her son, “Bring me another jar.”\nFinally he said, “There aren’t any more.” Then the oil stopped.",
      "7": "So she went and told the man of God. He said, “Go and sell the oil and pay your debt. Then you and your sons can live off what’s left.”",
      "8": "One day Elisha went to Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to eat a meal with her. So whenever he passed by, he would stop there for a meal.",
      "9": "Then she said to her husband, “Listen. I know that the man who passes by here all the time is a holy man of God.",
      "10": "Let’s make a small upper room on the roof, and let’s put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. Then whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.”",
      "11": "One day when Elisha came there, he went into the room and lay down.",
      "12": "Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call the woman of Shunem.” He called her, and she stood in front of him.",
      "13": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘You have been very concerned about us. What can we do for you? Is there something we can request for you from the king or from the commander of the army?’”\nShe said, “I am living among my own people.”",
      "14": "Then he said, “What can be done for her?”\nThen Gehazi said, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”",
      "15": "He said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood at the doorway.",
      "16": "Then he said to her, “At this time next year, you will be holding a son.”\nBut she said, “No, my lord, you man of God. Do not deceive your servant.”",
      "17": "But the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son at that same time of year, just as Elisha said to her.",
      "18": "The boy grew up, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.",
      "19": "Then he said to his father, “My head! My head!”\nHis father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”",
      "20": "So he picked him up and carried him to his mother, and the boy sat on her lap until noon. Then he died.",
      "21": "Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God. She shut the door behind her and went out.",
      "22": "Then she called to her husband and said, “Send one of the servants to me with one of the donkeys, so that I can run to the man of God and come back.”",
      "23": "He said, “Why are you going to him today? It’s not the new moon, and it’s not the Sabbath.”\nBut she said, “It’s all right.”",
      "24": "Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead the way. Don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.”",
      "25": "So she went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.\nWhen the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! That’s the woman from Shunem!",
      "26": "Now run to meet her and say, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your son all right?’”\nShe answered, “We’re all right.”",
      "27": "Then she came to the man of God at the mountain, and she grasped his feet. Gehazi stepped forward to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is in distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me. He has not told me.”",
      "28": "Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Didn’t I say, ‘Don’t give me false hope’?”",
      "29": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Hike up your garments for travel, and take my staff in your hand and go! If you meet someone, do not greet him, and if someone greets you, do not answer. Put my staff on the boy’s face.”",
      "30": "But the boy’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.",
      "31": "Gehazi went ahead of them and put the staff on the boy’s face. But there was no sound, and there was no response. So he went back to Elisha and told him, “The boy did not wake up.”",
      "32": "When Elisha came to the house, there the boy was—dead, lying on his bed.",
      "33": "So he went in and he shut the door behind the two of them. Then he prayed to the Lord.",
      "34": "He got up and lay down on top of the boy. He put his mouth to the boy’s mouth, his eyes to the boy’s eyes, his palms to the boy’s palms. Then he bent down over him, and the boy’s flesh became warm.",
      "35": "He went back into the house and paced back and forth. Then he went up and bent down over him, and the boy sneezed seven times. Then the boy opened his eyes.",
      "36": "Then Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call the woman of Shunem!” So he called her, and she came in. He said, “Pick up your son.”",
      "37": "So she came in and fell at Elisha’s feet and bowed down to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.",
      "38": "Then Elisha returned to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting with him, and he said to his servant, “Put the large cooking pot on the fire, and cook some stew for the sons of the prophets.”",
      "39": "One of the men went out to the field to gather plants. He found a wild vine and picked some gourds from it. He filled his garment with them. Then he came in and cut them into pieces for the pot of stew. They did not know what they were,",
      "40": "but they served it to the men to eat. While they were eating the stew, they cried out, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” So they could not eat it.",
      "41": "But he said, “Take some flour and throw it into the pot.” Then he said, “Serve it to the people.” They ate, and there was nothing harmful in the pot.",
      "42": "A man came from Baal Shalishah and brought the man of God some bread from the first ripe grain, twenty loaves of barley bread, and some new grain in his sack. Elisha said, “Set it before the people so that they can eat.”",
      "43": "His attendant said, “How can I set this before one hundred men?” But he said, “Set it before the people so that they may eat, for this is what the Lord says: They will eat and have some left over.” So he set it before them. They ate, and they had some left over, just as the Lord had said."

      "1": "Na’aman, the commander of the king of Aram’s army, was a great man in the opinion of his master. He was highly honored because the Lord had provided victory for Aram through him. Although he was a powerful warrior, he had leprosy.",
      "2": "Raiding parties had once gone out from Aram and brought back a young girl. She served Na’aman’s wife.",
      "3": "She said to her mistress, “I wish my master stood before the prophet who is in Samaria, because he would cure him of his leprosy.”",
      "4": "So Na’aman went and told his master what the servant girl from the land of Israel had said.",
      "5": "Then the king of Aram said, “Go there. I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Na’aman went, and he took ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.",
      "6": "Then he took the letter to the king of Israel. The letter said, “Now, when you receive this letter, you will know that I am sending my officer Na’aman to you so that you can cure him of his leprosy.”",
      "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothing and said, “Am I God that I can kill and make alive? Why is he sending a man to me for me to heal him from his leprosy? See how he is looking for a pretext to fight against me.”",
      "8": "But when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”",
      "9": "So Na’aman went with his horses and chariots and stopped in front of the door of Elisha’s house.",
      "10": "But Elisha sent a messenger out to him to say, “Go and wash seven times in the Jordan. Then your flesh will be restored and you will be clean.”",
      "11": "But Na’aman was angry and he left, saying, “Look, I said to myself, ‘He will certainly come out and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and wave his hand over the place, and I will be cured of the leprosy!’",
      "12": "Aren’t the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a burning rage.",
      "13": "But his servants approached and spoke to him. They said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not do it? How much more when he says to you, ‘Wash and be clean’?”",
      "14": "So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, just as the man of God had said. Then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a small child, and he was clean.",
      "15": "Then he and his whole escort went back to the man of God. He stood in front of Elisha and said, “To be sure, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Now accept a gift from your servant.”",
      "16": "But Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord lives, in whose presence I stand, I will not take anything.” Even though Na’aman urged him to accept something, he refused.",
      "17": "Then Na’aman said, “If you do not want anything, please give me, your servant, as much dirt as two donkeys can carry, for your servant will never again burn incense or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord.",
      "18": "But may the Lord forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there and he supports himself on my arm, then I too have to bow down in the house of Rimmon. When I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord forgive your servant this one thing.”",
      "19": "Then Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.”\nWhen Na’aman had gone some distance from him,",
      "20": "Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “My master was too easy on this Aramean, Na’aman, when he did not accept anything that he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”",
      "21": "So Gehazi chased after Na’aman. When Na’aman saw him running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him. He said, “Is everything all right?”",
      "22": "Then Gehazi said, “Yes, everything is all right. My master sent me to say, ‘Look, just now two young men from the hill country of Ephraim, from the sons of the prophets, have come to me. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.”",
      "23": "Na’aman said, “Certainly! Take two talents!” He urged Gehazi and tied up the two talents of silver in two bags with the two sets of clothing. Then Na’aman gave them to his two servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.",
      "24": "When he came to the hill, he took the gifts from them. Then he hid them in the house and sent the men back, so they left.",
      "25": "Then he went in and attended his master.\nElisha said to him, “Where were you, Gehazi?”\nGehazi said, “Your servant didn’t go anywhere.”",
      "26": "Then Elisha said to him, “Didn’t my heart go along when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take silver, or to accept clothing or olive groves or vineyards or sheep or cattle or male and female servants?",

      "7": "Then he said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.",
      "8": "Now when the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he would make plans with his officials, saying, “My camp will be at such and such a place.”",
      "9": "But the man of God would send a message to the king of Israel, saying, “Be careful when you pass this place because the Arameans are going down there.”",

      "11": "The king of Aram was enraged because of this. He summoned his officials and said to them, “Won’t you tell me who of us is for the king of Israel?”",
      "12": "One of his officials said, “No, my lord the king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words which you speak in your bedroom.”",
