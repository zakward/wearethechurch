      "4": "He did this when he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, so that we would be holy and blameless in his sight. In love",
      "5": "he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ. He did this in accordance with the good purpose of his will,",

      "7": "In him we also have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in keeping with the riches of his grace,",
      "8": "which he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight.",
      "9": "He made known to us the mystery of his will in keeping with his good purpose, which he planned in Christ.",
      "10": "This was to be carried out when the time had fully come, in order to bring all things together in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth.",
      "11": "In him we have also obtained an inheritance, because we were predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in keeping with the purpose of his will.",

      "13": "In him, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and in him, when you also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.",
      "14": "He is the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of God’s own possession, so that his glory would be praised.",
      "15": "This is why, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,",
      "16": "I never stop giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.",
      "17": "I keep praying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, will give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in knowing Christ fully.",

      "20": "It is as great as the working of his mighty strength, which God worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,",
      "21": "far above all rule, authority, power, and dominion, and above every name that is given, not only in this age but also in the one to come.",

      "3": "Formerly, we all lived among them in the passions of our sinful flesh, as we carried out the desires of the sinful flesh and its thoughts. Like all the others, we were by nature objects of God’s wrath.",
      "4": "But God, because he is rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,",
      "5": "made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved!",

      "12": "remember that at that time you were separated from Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of the promise. You were without hope and without God in the world.",
      "13": "But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.",
      "14": "For he himself is our peace. He made the two groups one by destroying the wall of hostility that divided them",
      "15": "when he abolished the law of commandments and regulations in his flesh. He did this to create in himself one new person out of the two, in this way making peace.",
      "16": "And he did this to reconcile both to God in one body through the cross by putting the hostility to death on it.",
      "17": "He also came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.",
      "18": "For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.",

      "5": "This mystery was not made known to people in past generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets.",
      "6": "This mystery is that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and people who also share in the promise through the gospel.",

      "9": "and to enlighten everyone about the administration of this mystery. In past ages this mystery remained hidden in God, who created all things.",
      "10": "He did this so that, through the church, the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.",
      "11": "This was done according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
      "12": "In him we can freely approach God with confidence through faith in him.",

      "10": "He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.",

      "13": "This is to continue until we all reach unity in the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, resulting in a mature man with a stature reaching to the measure of the fullness of Christ.",
      "14": "The goal is that we would no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, when people use tricks and invent clever ways to lead us astray.",
      "15": "Instead, speaking the truth in love, we would in all things grow up into Christ, who is the head.",
      "16": "From him the whole body, being joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows in accordance with Christ’s activity when he measured out each individual part. He causes the growth of the body so that it builds itself up in love.",

      "18": "They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their hearts.",
      "19": "Because they have no sense of shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality, with an ever-increasing desire to practice every kind of impurity.",

      "22": "As far as your former way of life is concerned, you were taught to take off the old self, which is corrupted by its deceitful desires,",
      "23": "and to be renewed continually in the spirit of your mind,",
      "24": "and to put on the new self, which has been created to be like God in righteousness and true holiness.",

      "29": "Do not let any unwholesome talk come from your mouths. Say only what is beneficial when there is a need to build up others, so that it will be a blessing to those who hear.",
      "30": "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.",
      "31": "Get rid of every kind of bitterness, rage, anger, quarreling, and slander, along with every kind of malice.",

      "4": "Obscenity, foolish talk, and coarse joking are also out of place. Instead, give thanks.",
      "5": "Certainly you are aware of this: No immoral, impure, or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, who is God.",

      "10": "Try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord,",
      "11": "and do not participate in fruitless deeds of darkness. Instead, expose them.",
      "12": "For it is shameful even to mention the things that are done by people in secret.",
      "13": "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes things visible.",
      "14": "Therefore it is said, “Awake, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”",

      "19": "by speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (singing and making music with your hearts to the Lord),",
      "20": "by always giving thanks for everything to God the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
      "21": "and by submitting to one another in reverence for Christ.",

      "25": "Husbands, love your wives, in the same way as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her",
      "26": "to make her holy, by cleansing her with the washing of water in connection with the Word.",
      "27": "He did this so that he could present her to himself as a glorious church, having no stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but so that she would be holy and blameless.",
      "28": "In the same way, husbands have an obligation to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
      "29": "To be sure, no one has ever hated his own body, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,",
      "30": "because we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.",
