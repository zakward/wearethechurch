    "1": {
      "1": "This is what happened after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord.\nThe Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,",
      "2": "“Moses my servant is dead. So prepare to cross the Jordan River that lies in front of you. You and all this people, prepare to go into the land that I am about to give to the people of Israel.",
      "3": "I have given you every place where the sole of your foot has stepped, just as I promised Moses.",
      "4": "From the Wilderness and from Lebanon to the Great River, the Euphrates River—all the land of the Hittites—as far as the Mediterranean Sea, where the sun sets, this will be your territory.",
      "5": "No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, I will be with you. I will not abandon you, and I will not forsake you.",
      "6": "“Be strong and courageous, because you will divide this land among these people, this land which I swore to their fathers that I would give to this people.",
      "7": "Just be strong and very courageous. Be careful to act according to the entire Law which my servant Moses commanded for you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go.",
      "8": "This Book of the Law must never depart from your mouth, and you are to meditate on it day and night, so that you will act faithfully according to everything written in it, because then you will prosper in everything you do, and you will succeed.",
      "9": "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified and do not be overwhelmed, because the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”",
      "10": "So Joshua gave this order to the officers of the people:",
      "11": "“Go through the camp and give this order to the people: ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, because within three days you will be crossing over this Jordan to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving to you as a possession.’”",
      "12": "To the Reubenites and the Gadites and to half of the tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,",
      "13": "“Remember the command that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you when he said, ‘The Lord your God is granting you rest, and he has given you this land.’",
      "14": "Your wives, your children, and your cattle will stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but you yourselves, all of your strong warriors in their military units, are to cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers",
      "15": "until the Lord gives rest to them as he has to you and they too take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them. Then you may return to the land allotted to you so that you may fully possess the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to you in the area east of the Jordan, toward the sunrise.”",
      "16": "Then they answered Joshua, “Everything that you have commanded us we will do. We will go to any place you send us.",
      "17": "Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, we will likewise obey you. May the Lord your God be with you, just as he was with Moses.",
      "18": "Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey whatever you command him will be put to death. Just be strong and courageous!”"

      "1": "Now Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Shittim to be spies. He said, “Go and look over the land and Jericho.” So they set out and came to the house of a woman who was a prostitute. Her name was Rahab. They settled in to spend the night there.",
      "2": "It was reported to the king of Jericho: “Some Israelite men came here tonight to spy on the land.”",
      "3": "So the king of Jericho sent messengers to Rahab. They said, “Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who came to your house, because they have come to spy on the whole land.”",
      "4": "Now the woman had taken the two men and had hidden both of them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they were from.",
      "5": "When the gate was about to be shut at dark, the men left. I do not know where the men went. Go after them quickly so you can overtake them.”",
      "6": "But she actually had taken them up to the roof and had concealed them among the stalks of flax that she had spread out on the roof.",
      "7": "The men of Jericho then went to pursue them along the route to the Jordan that led to the fords. The city gate was closed just after the pursuers had gone out to pursue the spies.",
      "8": "But before the men lay down, Rahab came up to them on the roof.",
      "9": "She said to the men, “I know that the Lord has given you the land. Because of you, terror has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land are melting in fear before you.",
      "10": "Indeed, we have heard that the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea in front of you when you came out of Egypt, and we heard what you did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan—to Sihon and to Og. We heard that you devoted them to destruction.",
      "11": "We heard, and our hearts melted, and no one’s courage could hold up anymore against you, because the Lord your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.",
      "12": "So now, please swear to me by the Lord that since I have shown kindness to you, you in turn will show kindness to my father’s house. Give me a trustworthy sign",
      "13": "that you will preserve the lives of my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and everyone who belongs to them, and that you will spare our lives.”",
      "14": "The men said to her, “If you do not reveal what we are doing, our lives are pledged for your lives, even to the point of death. Then when the Lord gives us the land, we will show mercy and faithfulness to you.”",
      "15": "She let them down through the window with a rope, since her house was built into the city wall, and she was living inside the wall.",
      "16": "She said to them, “To the hill country! Get moving, so the pursuers do not catch up with you. Hide there for three days until the pursuers return, and then you can go on your way.”",
      "17": "The men said to her, “When we come into the land, we will be free from this oath that you made us swear",
      "18": "unless you tie this bright red cord in the window through which you let us down, and you gather your father and mother, your brothers, and your father’s entire household into your house.",
      "19": "If any one of them goes outside the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be free of guilt. Anyone who is with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads if a hand is laid on him.",
      "20": "If you reveal what we are doing, we will be free from the oath that you made us swear.”",
      "21": "She said, “It will be done just as you have said!” Then she sent them out, and they went away. She tied the bright red cord in the window.",
      "22": "After they left, they went up into the hill country and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers had searched for them all along the route, but they found nothing.",
      "23": "So then the two men set out to return. After they had come down from the hill country, they crossed the river and came to Joshua son of Nun. They reported to him everything that had happened to them.",
      "24": "They said to Joshua, “The Lord has without doubt given the entire land into our hands. What’s more, all the inhabitants of the land are melting in fear before us.”"

    "3": {
      "1": "After Joshua had gotten up early in the morning, he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and arrived at the Jordan. They stayed there until they crossed over.",
      "2": "After three days the officers went through the camp",
      "3": "and gave this order to the people: “As soon as you see the priests from the tribe of Levi carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, you are to set out from your position and follow the ark.",
      "4": "But keep a distance between you and the ark—about three thousand feet. Do not get too close to it, so that you can determine which way you should go, because you have never crossed over this way before.”",
      "5": "Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, because tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.”",
      "6": "Then Joshua said to the priests, “Lift up the Ark of the Covenant and pass by in front of the people.” So they lifted up the Ark of the Covenant and went ahead of the people.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel so that they will know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.",
      "8": "You are the one who will give this order to the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant: ‘As soon as you come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you are to stand still in the Jordan.’”",
      "9": "Joshua said to the people of Israel, “Come closer to me and listen to the words of the Lord your God.”",
      "10": "Then Joshua said, “This is how you will know that the Living God is among you and that he will most certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites:",
      "11": "Look, the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth is about to cross over the Jordan ahead of you.",
      "12": "So now choose for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.",
      "13": "As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing down from upstream will be cut off, and they will stand up in one heap.”",
      "14": "So the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of the people.",
      "15": "As soon as the priests carrying the ark came to the Jordan, and as soon as their feet dipped into the edge of the water (the Jordan is full and overflows all its banks during all the days of the grain harvest),",
      "16": "the waters flowing down from upstream came to a standstill. The waters piled up in one heap, very far away, at Adam, the town that is next to Zarethan, and the waters flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah, that is, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed the Jordan opposite Jericho.",
      "17": "The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel was crossing over on dry ground, until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the Lord told Joshua,",
      "2": "“Take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,",
      "3": "and give them the following orders: ‘Pick up twelve stones from here in the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the feet of the priests are standing securely. Carry them over with you and put them at the place where you will stay tonight.’”",
      "4": "So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had selected from the people of Israel—a man from each tribe.",
      "5": "Joshua said to them, “Go to the middle of the Jordan in front of the Ark of the Lord your God. There each man is to lift up one stone on his shoulder. The number will correspond to the number of the tribes descended from the sons of Israel,",
      "6": "so that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in the future, ‘What do these stones mean for you?’",
      "7": "Then you shall respond to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off in front of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. When the ark passed through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will serve as a permanent memorial for the people of Israel.”",
      "8": "So the people of Israel did just as Joshua had ordered. They picked up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, corresponding to the number of the tribes descended from the sons of Israel, as the Lord had instructed Joshua. They carried the stones over with them to their lodging place and deposited them there.",
      "9": "Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant had stood. They are there to this day.",
      "10": "The priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people had been accomplished, just as Moses had commanded Joshua. The people moved swiftly and completed the crossing.",
      "11": "When all the people had finished crossing, the Ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people.",
      "12": "The descendants of Reuben, the descendants of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, arranged by their military units, had crossed over ahead of the people of Israel, just as Moses had commanded them,",
      "13": "about forty thousand men armed for battle. They crossed over to the plain near Jericho to wage war in the presence of the Lord.",
      "14": "That day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they honored him, just as they had honored Moses, all the days of his life.",
      "15": "The Lord said to Joshua,",
      "16": "“Command the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Testimony that they should come up out of the Jordan.”",
      "17": "So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”",
      "18": "When the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came up from the middle of the Jordan, as soon as the soles of their feet reached dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and it overflowed all its banks as before.",
      "19": "The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and set up camp at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.",
      "20": "Those twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.",
      "21": "He said to the people of Israel, “When your children in the future ask their fathers, ‘What are these stones?’",
      "22": "you shall teach your children, ‘On dry land Israel crossed over this Jordan.’",
      "23": "For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of you until you crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up in front of us until we had crossed over.",
      "24": "He did this so that all the peoples of the earth would know that the hand of the Lord is strong, so that you would fear the Lord your God always.”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "When all the kings of the Amorites who were in the region west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the people of Israel until we had crossed over, their hearts melted, and they lost all courage in the presence of the Israelites.",
      "2": "At that time the Lord said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise the sons of Israel again, a second time.”",
      "3": "So Joshua made flint knives, and he circumcised the sons of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins.",
      "4": "This is the reason Joshua had to circumcise the men of Israel again: All the people who came up out of Egypt—all the males, the fighting men—died in the wilderness along the way after they came out of Egypt.",
      "5": "All the people who came out of Egypt had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey after they had come out from Egypt had not been circumcised.",
      "6": "Yes, for forty years the Israelites walked through the wilderness until the whole nation was gone—all the fighting men who had gone out from Egypt, who had not listened to the voice of the Lord. The Lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land that the Lord had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.",
      "7": "So it was their sons, whom the Lord had raised up in their place, whom Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised, since the people had not circumcised them during the journey.",
      "8": "When the whole nation had been circumcised, they stayed at their places in the camp until they recuperated.",
      "9": "Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is Gilgal to this day.",
      "10": "While the people of Israel were camped at Gilgal, they celebrated the Passover on the plain near Jericho on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening at sunset.",
      "11": "They ate from the produce of the land on the day after the Passover. On that very day they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain.",
      "12": "The manna stopped the day after the first day that they had eaten from the produce of the land. The people of Israel no longer received manna. Instead, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year.",
      "13": "When Joshua was at Jericho, he looked up and saw a man was standing right there in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said, “Are you one of us or one of our enemies?”",
      "14": "The man said, “Neither! I have now come as the commander of the army of the Lord.” Joshua fell with his face to the ground and worshipped. Then he said to him, “What does my Lord have to say to his servant?”",
      "15": "The commander of the army of the Lord said to Joshua, “Take your sandals off your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy.” So Joshua did so."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Jericho was shut up tight because of the Israelites. There was no one going out and no one coming in.",
      "2": "So the Lord said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho and its king into your hands even though they are strong warriors.",
      "3": "You shall march around the city with all the fighting men. Circle the city one time. Do this for six days.",
      "4": "Seven priests shall carry seven special ram’s horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times with the priests blowing the ram’s horns.",
      "5": "When there is a long blast on the special ram’s horn of jubilee, when you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, all the people shall shout with a loud war cry. Then the wall of the city will collapse on itself, and the people will go up into the city, one man after another.”",
      "6": "So Joshua son of Nun called for the priests and said to them, “Lift up the Ark of the Covenant, and seven priests shall carry seven special ram’s horns in front of the Ark of the Lord.”",
      "7": "Then he said to the people, “Move out. March around the city. The armed contingent shall march in front of the Ark of the Lord.”",
      "8": "When Joshua had given orders to the people, the seven priests with the seven special ram’s horns moved forward in front of the Lord, blowing the ram’s horns continuously, with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord following them.",
      "9": "The armed contingent was marching ahead of the priests, who were blowing the ram’s horns, and the rear guard was following the ark. The priests kept blowing the ram’s horns as they went.",
      "10": "But to the people Joshua had given the order, “Do not shout and do not let your voice be heard. Do not let a word go out of your mouth until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout!”",
      "11": "So he had the Ark of the Lord go around the city, sending it out to circle the city one time. Then they came back to the camp and spent the night there.",
      "12": "Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests lifted up the Ark of the Lord.",
      "13": "The seven priests with the seven special ram’s horns moved forward in front of the Ark of the Lord, blowing the ram’s horns continuously. The armed contingent was marching in front of them, and the rear guard was following behind the Ark of the Lord. The priests kept blowing the ram’s horns as they went.",
      "14": "They marched around the city one time on the second day, and then they returned to the camp. They did this for six days.",
      "15": "Then on the seventh day they got up early, at daybreak, and they marched around the city seven times, following the directions they had been given. It was only on the seventh day that they marched around the city seven times.",
      "16": "Then on the seventh time, the priests blew the ram’s horns, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout, because the Lord has given you the city!",
      "17": "The city will be devoted to destruction. The city and everything in it will be devoted to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute will live—she along with all who are with her in the house—because she hid the agents whom we sent.",
      "18": "But you must keep away from the things devoted to destruction, or you will make yourselves subject to destruction by taking some of the devoted things, and you will make the camp of Israel subject to destruction and bring disaster upon it.",
      "19": "But all the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord. They must go into the treasury of the Lord.”",
      "20": "So the people shouted, and the priests blew the ram’s horns. When the people heard the sound of the ram’s horns, they shouted with a loud war cry. Then the wall collapsed on itself, and the people went up into the city, one man after another. So they captured the city.",
      "21": "Then they applied the decree of destruction by the edge of the sword to everything that was in the city—both men and women, young and old, and also the oxen, sheep, and donkeys.",
      "22": "To the two men who had spied on the land Joshua said, “Go to the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and everyone who belongs to her, just as you swore to her.”",
      "23": "So the young men who had acted as spies went and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and everyone who belonged to her. They brought out all her family members, and they settled them outside the camp of Israel.",
      "24": "But the city and everything in it they burned with fire. Only the silver and gold and the bronze and iron vessels were placed into the treasury of the House of the Lord.",
      "25": "But Joshua spared the lives of Rahab the prostitute and her father’s household and everyone who belonged to her, and she has lived within Israel to this day, because she hid the agents that Joshua sent to spy on Jericho.",
      "26": "At that time Joshua swore an oath:\nCursed before the Lord is the man who sets out to rebuild this city, Jericho.\nAt the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation,\nand at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.",
      "27": "So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread through the whole land."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "The people of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things. Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things, and the anger of the Lord burned against the people of Israel.",
      "2": "Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He said to them, “Go up and spy on the land.” So the men went up and spied on Ai.",
      "3": "They returned to Joshua and told him, “All the people do not need to go up. Let about two or three thousand men go up, and they can defeat Ai. Do not trouble all the people with going up there, because there are only a few people in Ai.”",
      "4": "So about three thousand men from among the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai.",
      "5": "The men of Ai struck dead about thirty-six of them. They pursued them from the city gate as far as Shebarim, and they struck them dead on the way down the descent. So the hearts of the people melted and turned to water.",
      "6": "Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell down with his face to the ground in front of the Ark of the Lord until evening—he and the elders of Israel. They also threw dust on their heads.",
      "7": "Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord God! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to place us into the hand of the Amorites to exterminate us? If only we had been willing to settle in the area on the other side of the Jordan!",
      "8": "Please bear with me, my Lord! What can I say after Israel has turned its back before its enemies?",
      "9": "Now the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will you do for your great name?”",
      "10": "Then the Lord gave directions to Joshua:\nYou, get up! Why are you falling on your face?",
      "11": "Israel has sinned! They have transgressed the covenant that I commanded for them! Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things. They have stolen! They have deceived! Yes, they have even placed the devoted things that they stole among their own goods.",
      "12": "That is why the people of Israel are not able to stand before their enemies. They turned their backs before their enemies because they have become liable to destruction. I will not continue to be with you unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.",
      "13": "Get up and consecrate the people. You are to tell them: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says. Things devoted to destruction are in your midst, Israel. You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove the devoted things from your midst.",
      "14": "In the morning you are to present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord identifies is to come forward by clans. The clan that the Lord identifies is to come forward by households. The household that the Lord identifies is to come forward one man at a time.",
      "15": "Then the man who is caught with the devoted things is to be burned with fire—he and all that belongs to him—because he transgressed the covenant of the Lord and because he committed sacrilege in Israel.",
      "16": "Joshua got up early in the morning, and he had Israel come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe of Judah was identified.",
      "17": "Then he had the tribe of Judah come forward, and he identified the clan of the Zerahites. Next, he had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by individual families, and Zabdi’s family was identified.",
      "18": "Then he had Zabdi’s household come forward one man at a time, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was identified.",
      "19": "Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory now to the Lord, the God of Israel, and give him praise. Now tell me what you did. Do not conceal it from me.”",
      "20": "Achan answered Joshua, “It is true. I am the one who has sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this is what I did:",
      "21": "Among the plunder I saw an expensive Mesopotamian robe, a fine one, and two hundred shekels of silver and one wedge of gold—it weighed fifty shekels. I coveted them and I took them. Now they are hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver is underneath it.”",
      "22": "So Joshua sent agents. They ran to the tent, and there it was! The robe was hidden in his tent, and the silver was underneath it!",
      "23": "They took them from the middle of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel, where they poured them out before the Lord.",
      "24": "Then Joshua took Achan son of Zerah and the silver, the garment, and the wedge of gold, as well as Achan’s sons and his daughters, his ox, his donkey and his flock, and his tent and everything that belonged to him—so all Israel, led by Joshua, brought them up to the Valley of Achor.",
      "25": "Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster on us? The Lord will bring disaster on you this day!”\nThen all Israel stoned Achan to death. They also burned him and them with fire, and they pelted them with stones.",
      "26": "They erected a large heap of stones over Achan, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from the heat of his anger. For that reason the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day."

      "2": "You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king, but its plunder and its livestock you may take as spoils of war for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city on the west side of it.”",
      "3": "So Joshua and the whole military force got ready to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, strong warriors, and sent them out during the night.",

      "30": "Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,",
      "31": "just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the people of Israel. According to the directions written in the Book of the Law of Moses, it was an altar of uncut stones, upon which no one had used an iron tool. They offered up burnt offerings to the Lord on it, and they also sacrificed fellowship offerings.",
