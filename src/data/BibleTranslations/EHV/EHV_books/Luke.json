      "59": "On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. They wanted to call him Zechariah after the name of the father.",
      "60": "But his mother answered, “No. He will be called John.”",
      "61": "They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”",
      "62": "They made signs to his father, to see what he wanted to name him.",
      "63": "He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.",

      "65": "Fear came on all who lived around them. In the entire hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.",
      "66": "And everyone who heard this took it to heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” Clearly, the hand of the Lord was with him.",
      "67": "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:",
      "68": "Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nbecause he has visited us and prepared redemption for his people.",

      "3": "Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”\n“It is as you say,” Jesus replied.",
      "4": "Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”",
      "5": "But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people, teaching all through Judea, beginning from Galilee all the way here.”",
      "6": "When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.",
      "7": "When he learned that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.",
      "8": "When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad. For a long time, he had wanted to see him, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle performed by him.",
      "9": "He questioned him with many words, but Jesus gave him no answer.",
      "10": "The chief priests and the experts in the law stood there, vehemently accusing him.",
      "11": "Herod, along with his soldiers, treated him with contempt and ridiculed him. Dressing him in bright clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.",
      "12": "Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that day. Before this they had been enemies of each other.",
      "13": "Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,",
      "14": "and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who is misleading the people. Look, I have examined him in your presence. I have found in this man no basis for the charges you are bringing against him.",
      "15": "Herod did not either, for he sent him back to us. See, he has done nothing worthy of death.",
      "16": "So I will have him flogged and release him.”",
      "17": "Pilate needed to release one prisoner to them at the Festival.",
      "18": "But they all shouted together with one voice: “Take him away! Release Barabbas to us!”",

      "22": "He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has he done? I have found no grounds for sentencing him to death. So I will whip him and release him.”",
      "23": "But they kept pressuring him with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. And their voices were overwhelming.",
      "24": "So Pilate decided that what they demanded would be done.",
      "25": "He released the one they had asked for, who had been thrown in prison for rebellion and murder, but he handed Jesus over to their will.",
      "26": "As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country. They placed the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
      "27": "A large crowd of people was following him, including women who were mourning and wailing for him.",
      "28": "Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.",
      "29": "Be sure of this: The days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never gave birth, and the breasts that never nursed.’",
      "30": "Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’",
      "31": "For if they do these things to the green wood, what will happen to the dry?”",
      "32": "Two other men, who were criminals, were led away with Jesus to be executed.",
      "33": "When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.",
      "34": "Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”\nThey cast lots to divide his garments among them.",
      "35": "The people stood watching. The rulers were ridiculing him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!”",
      "36": "The soldiers also made fun of him. Coming up to him, they offered him sour wine,",
      "37": "saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”",
      "38": "There was also an inscription written above him: “This is the King of the Jews.”",
      "39": "One of the criminals hanging there was blaspheming him, saying, “Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!”",
      "40": "But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?",
      "41": "We are punished justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we have done, but this man has done nothing wrong.”",
      "42": "Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.”",
      "43": "Jesus said to him, “Amen I tell you: Today you will be with me in paradise.”",
      "44": "It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,",
      "45": "while the sun was darkened. Then the curtain of the temple was torn in two.",
      "46": "Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” When he had said this, he breathed his last.",
      "47": "When the centurion saw what had happened, he began to glorify God, saying, “This man really was righteous.”",
      "48": "When all the groups of people who had gathered to see this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their chests.",
      "49": "All those who knew Jesus, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.",
      "50": "Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man.",
      "51": "He had not agreed with their plan and action. He was looking forward to the kingdom of God.",
      "52": "This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.",
      "53": "He took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb that was cut out of rock, where no one had yet been laid.",
      "54": "It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning.",
      "55": "The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed after Joseph, and they observed the tomb and how his body was laid there.",

      "6": "He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee",
      "7": "that the Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”",
      "8": "Then they remembered his words.",
