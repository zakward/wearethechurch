      "1": "The Elder,\nTo dear Gaius, whom I love in the truth:",
      "2": "Dear friend, I pray that you are doing well in every way and have good health, just as your soul is doing well.",
      "3": "Indeed, I was overjoyed when brothers came and testified to your truthfulness because you are walking in the truth.",
      "4": "I have no greater joy than when I hear that my children are walking in the truth.",
      "5": "Dear friend, you are being faithful in what you are doing for the brothers even though they are strangers.",
      "6": "They have testified before the church about your love. You will do well to send them off in a manner worthy of God.",
      "7": "They went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.",
      "8": "Therefore, we have an obligation to support such men, so that we may be coworkers for the truth.",
      "9": "I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, does not welcome us.",
      "10": "For this reason, if I do come, I will call attention to what he is doing. He is disparaging us with wicked words, and he is not content with that. He also refuses to welcome the brothers. He even hinders and puts out of the church those who wish to welcome them.",
      "11": "Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does what is good is from God. The one who does what is evil has not seen God.",
      "12": "Demetrius has been endorsed by everyone, even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.",
      "13": "I had many things to write you, but I do not want to do it with pen and ink.",
      "14": "I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.",
      "15": "Peace to you. Your friends here send their greetings to you. Greet our friends there by name."
