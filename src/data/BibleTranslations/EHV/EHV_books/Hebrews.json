      "3": "The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact imprint of the divine nature. He sustains all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high.",
      "4": "The Son became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.",
      "5": "For to which of the angels did God ever say:\nYou are my Son. Today I have begotten you?\nAnd again:\nI will be his Father, and he will be my Son.",
      "6": "And again, when he brought his firstborn into the world, he said:\nLet all God’s angels worship him.",
      "7": "About the angels he says:\nHe makes his messengers winds and his ministers flaming fire.",
      "8": "But about the Son he says:\nGod, your throne is forever and ever,\nand the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.",
      "9": "You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness.\nTherefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy\n    beyond your companions.",
      "10": "And he says:\nIn the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth,\nand the heavens are the works of your hands.",

      "12": "You will roll them up like a robe,\nand they will be changed like a garment.\nBut you are the same,\nand your years will never end.",
      "13": "To which of the angels has he ever said:\nSit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool under your feet?",
      "14": "Are not all angels ministering spirits sent out to serve for the benefit of those who are going to inherit salvation?"

    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore, we need to pay even more attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.",
      "2": "For if the message that was spoken through angels was valid, and every transgression and disobedient act received a just punishment,",
      "3": "how will we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? First the message was spoken by the Lord; then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.",
      "4": "God also testified to it with signs and wonders, various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his will.",
      "5": "For God did not place the coming world, about which we are speaking, under the control of angels.",
      "6": "But there is a place where someone has testified:\nWhat is man that you remember him,\nor the Son of Man that you look after him?",
      "7": "You made him lower than the angels for a little while.\nYou crowned him with glory and honor.",
      "8": "You put everything in subjection under his feet.\nIndeed, in putting everything in subjection to him, God left nothing that is not in subjection to him. At the present time, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.",
      "9": "But we look to Jesus (the one who was made lower than the angels for a little while, so that by God’s grace he might taste death for everyone), now crowned with glory and honor, because he suffered death.",
      "10": "Certainly it was fitting for God (the one for whom and through whom everything exists), in leading many sons to glory, to bring the author of their salvation to his goal through sufferings.",
      "11": "For he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have one Father. For that reason, he is not ashamed to call them brothers.",
      "12": "He says:\nI will declare your name to my brothers.\nWithin the congregation I will sing your praise.",
      "13": "And again:\nI will trust in him.\nAnd again:\nHere I am and the children God has given me.",
      "14": "Therefore, since the children share flesh and blood, he also shared the same flesh and blood, so that through death he could destroy the one who had the power of death (that is, the Devil)",
      "15": "and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death.",
      "16": "For surely he was not concerned with helping angels but with helping Abraham’s offspring.",
      "17": "For this reason, he had to become like his brothers in every way, in order that he would be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God, so that he could pay for the sins of the people.",

      "3": "In fact, Jesus is worthy of greater glory than Moses, in the same way that the builder of a house has more honor than the house.",
      "4": "For every house is built by someone, and God is the one who built everything.",
      "5": "Moses was faithful as a servant within God’s whole house by testifying to the things that would be spoken.",
      "6": "But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house. We are his house, if we hold on firmly to our confidence and the hope about which we boast until the end.",
      "7": "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:\nToday, if you hear his voice,",
      "8": "do not harden your hearts\nas in the rebellion,\nduring the time of testing in the wilderness.",
      "9": "Your fathers tested and tried me,\neven though they saw my works",
      "10": "for forty years.\nThat is why I was angry with that generation\nand said, “In their heart they are always going astray,\nand they did not learn my ways.”",
      "11": "So I swore an oath in my wrath,\n“They will never enter my rest.”",
      "12": "Watch out, brothers, so that there is not an evil, unbelieving heart in any of you that turns away from the living God.",
      "13": "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “today,” so that none of you are hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.",
      "14": "For we have become people who share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firmly until the end.",
      "15": "As it is said:\nToday, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.",
      "16": "Who was it who heard and rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who left Egypt, led by Moses?",
      "17": "And with whom was God angry for forty years? Surely it was with the ones who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness, wasn’t it?",
      "18": "And about whom did he swear an oath that they would not enter his rest, if it wasn’t concerning those who were disobedient?",
      "19": "So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."

      "2": "In fact, we have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united in faith with those who did listen.",
      "3": "Indeed, we who believe are going to enter his rest.\nIt happened just as he vowed when he said:\nSo I swore an oath in my wrath,\n“They will never enter my rest.”\nAnd yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world.",
      "4": "For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in this way:\nAnd God rested on the seventh day from all his works.",
      "5": "And again in this statement:\nThey will never enter my rest.",
      "6": "Therefore, since it is still the case that some do enter this rest, and yet those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not enter because of disobedience,",
      "7": "God again set a certain day, namely, “today,” when he later said through David, as quoted before:\nToday, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts.",
      "8": "For, if Joshua had given them rest, then God would not have spoken later about another day.",
      "9": "So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.",
      "10": "For the one who enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God rested from his work.",
      "11": "Therefore, let us make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.",
      "12": "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword. It penetrates even to the point of dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow, even being able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart.",
      "13": "And there is no creature hidden from him, but everything is uncovered and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we will give an account.",
      "14": "Therefore, since we have a great high priest, who has gone through the heavens, namely, Jesus the Son of God, let us continue to hold on to our confession.",
      "15": "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin.",
      "16": "So let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
    },

      "1": "To be sure, every high priest is chosen from the people and is appointed to represent the people in the things pertaining to God, so that he may offer gifts, as well as sacrifices, for sins.",

      "3": "And for this reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the people.",
      "4": "No one takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.",
      "5": "In the same way, Christ did not take the glory of becoming a high priest on himself, but God said to him:\nYou are my Son.\nToday I have begotten you.",
      "6": "He also said the same thing in another place:\nYou are a priest forever, like Melchizedek.",
      "7": "In the days of his flesh, he offered prayers and pleas with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.",
      "8": "Although he was the Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.",
      "9": "After he was brought to his goal, he became the source of eternal salvation for everyone who obeys him,",
      "10": "because he was designated by God as a high priest, like Melchizedek.",
      "11": "We have much to say about this, and it is difficult to explain, because you have become too lazy to listen.",
      "12": "In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the beginning principles of God’s word all over again. You have become people who need milk, not solid food.",
      "13": "For everyone who lives on milk is not acquainted with the word of righteousness, because he is still an infant.",
      "14": "But solid food is for mature people, who have their senses trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Therefore, leaving the beginning discussion of Christ, let us press on toward matters that require greater maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith in God,",

      "3": "And we will do this, if God permits.",
      "4": "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift and shared in the Holy Spirit,",
      "5": "who have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,",
      "6": "and who then fell away, to be restored to repentance because they are crucifying the Son of God again, to their own harm, and exposing him to public ridicule.",
      "7": "For the land that drinks the rain that often falls on it and produces plants useful to those farming it, this land receives a blessing from God.",
      "8": "But the land that grows thorns and thistles is worthless and will soon be cursed—its end is to be burned.",
      "9": "But even if we speak this way, we are confident of better things for you, dear friends, things belonging to salvation.",
      "10": "For God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love that you showed for his name’s sake, when you served the saints, and while you continue to serve them.",
      "11": "And we want each of you to continue to show the same eagerness, so that you may have the full assurance of your hope until the end.",
      "12": "Our goal is that you would not become lazy but imitators of those who inherited the promise through faith and patient endurance.",
      "13": "For God made a promise to Abraham, and since God had no one greater to swear by, “He swore by himself.”",
      "14": "He said, “I will most certainly bless you and make you increase in number.”",
      "15": "And so in this way, after Abraham had waited patiently, he received the promise.",
      "16": "To be sure, people swear by someone who is greater, and the oath serves as a confirmation for them that ends all disputes.",
      "17": "Because God wanted to show the heirs of the promise with even greater certainty that his plan was unchangeable, he guaranteed his promise with an oath.",
      "18": "He did this so that, through two unchangeable things (in which it is impossible that God would lie), we, who have fled for refuge by taking hold of this hope that is held out to us, might have strong encouragement.",
      "19": "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul. It is sure and firm, and it goes behind the inner curtain,",
      "20": "where Jesus entered ahead of us on our behalf, because he became a high priest forever like Melchizedek."

      "1": "This Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, is the one who met Abraham as he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,",
      "2": "and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, Melchizedek means “king of righteousness,” and then “king of Salem,” which is “king of peace.”",
      "3": "He is without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, and resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.",
      "4": "Consider how great this man was. Even Abraham, the patriarch, gave him a tenth from the best of the spoils.",
      "5": "According to the law, those sons of Levi who received the priesthood have a command to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brother Israelites, even though they also came from Abraham’s body.",
      "6": "But here the one who was not descended from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.",
      "7": "And without any question, it is the lesser who is blessed by the greater.",
      "8": "In the one case, those who are mortal collect the tenth; in the other case, the one who collects has testimony in Scripture that he lives.",
      "9": "And, through Abraham, even Levi, who collects the tenth, has paid a tenth, so to speak,",
      "10": "because he was still in the body of his forefather when Melchizedek met Abraham.",
      "11": "So if everything could have been brought to its goal through the Levitical priesthood (for the people received the law on the basis of that priesthood), what further need was there for another priest to arise who was like Melchizedek, yet not said to be like Aaron?",
      "12": "For when the priesthood is changed, by necessity a change in the law also happens.",
      "13": "Yet these things are said about the one who belonged to another tribe, from which no one had served at the altar.",
      "14": "It is certainly clear that our Lord is descended from Judah. Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe.",
      "15": "And this becomes even clearer if another priest arises like Melchizedek,",
      "16": "who became a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement about physical descent, but on the basis of the power of an endless life.",
      "17": "For it has been testified in Scripture about him:\nYou are a priest forever, like Melchizedek.",
      "18": "To be sure, the former requirement is annulled, because it was weak and useless—",
      "19": "for the law did not bring anything to its goal—but now a better hope is introduced, by which we approach God.",
      "20": "And something like this did not happen without an oath. Indeed, others who became priests did so without an oath,",
      "21": "but this one became a priest with an oath, through the one who said to him:\nThe Lord has sworn an oath\nand will not change his mind:\n“You are a priest forever.”",
      "22": "In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.",
      "23": "There were many who became priests because death prevented any of them from continuing to remain in office.",
      "24": "But because this one endures forever, he has a permanent priesthood.",
      "25": "So for this reason he is able to save forever those who come to God through him, because he always lives to plead on their behalf.",
      "26": "This is certainly the kind of high priest we needed: one who is holy, innocent, pure, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.",
      "27": "Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices on a daily basis, first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people. In fact, he sacrificed for sins once and for all when he offered himself.",
      "28": "For the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been brought to his goal forever."

      "2": "He is the minister in the Holy Place, which is the true sanctuary, which the Lord set up, not man.",
      "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices, and for that reason this priest also needed to have something that he offered.",
      "4": "If this priest were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are priests who are designated by the law to offer gifts.",
      "5": "They serve at a place that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, a place exactly like that about which Moses was told when he was about to complete the tent. For God said, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.”",
      "6": "But now, Jesus has obtained a ministry that is as much superior as the covenant that he mediates is better, because it has been established on the basis of better promises.",
      "7": "Indeed, if that first covenant were without fault, there would have been no reason to look for a second.",
      "8": "But because God found fault with the people, he said:\nLook, the days are coming, says the Lord,\nwhen I will make a new covenant\nwith the house of Israel\nand with the house of Judah.",
      "9": "It will not be like the covenant\nthat I made with their forefathers\nat the time when I took them by the hand\nto lead them out of Egypt.\nBecause they did not remember my covenant,\nI ignored them, says the Lord.",
      "10": "This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord.\nI will put my laws into their mind,\nand I will write them on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\nand they will be my people.",
      "11": "Never again will a man teach his fellow citizen\nor his brother, saying, “Know the Lord,”\nbecause they will all know me,\nfrom the least of them to the greatest.",

      "14": "how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works, so that we worship the living God?",
      "15": "For this reason, he is the mediator of a new covenant. A death took place as payment for the trespasses committed under the first covenant, so that those who are called would receive the promised eternal inheritance.",
      "16": "For where a will exists, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made the will.",
      "17": "For a will takes effect at the time of death, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is still living.",
      "18": "For this reason, the first covenant was not ratified without blood.",
      "19": "Indeed, after every command was spoken by Moses to all the people, in accordance with the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and a hyssop branch, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.",
