      "6": "His father had never rebuked him by saying, “Why are you acting like this?”\nAdonijah also was very handsome and had been born next in line after Absalom.",
      "7": "Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest conspired with Adonijah and gave him their support.",

      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and specially fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth, which was near En Rogel Spring. He invited all of his brothers, the king’s sons, and all of the king’s officials from Judah.",

      "11": "Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know about it?",
      "12": "Now let me give you some advice on how to save your life and the life of your son Solomon:",
      "13": "Go to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, didn’t you swear to me your servant and promise me, “Your son Solomon will be king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Then why has Adonijah become king?’",
      "14": "Then, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”",
      "15": "So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber. The king was very old, and Abishag from Shunem was taking care of him.",
      "16": "Bathsheba knelt and bowed down before the king. The king said, “Why have you come?”",
      "17": "She said, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God and promised, ‘Your son Solomon will be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.’",
      "18": "But now, look, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, did not know about it.",
      "19": "He has sacrificed cattle, specially fattened calves, and sheep in abundance. He has invited all the king’s sons, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he has not invited your servant Solomon.",
      "20": "Now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, waiting for you to tell them who will sit on my lord the king’s throne after him.",

      "22": "Just then, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",
      "23": "The king was told, “The prophet Nathan is here.” Nathan went in and bowed down to the ground before the king.",
      "24": "Nathan said, “Did you, my lord the king, say, ‘Adonijah will be king after me, and he will sit on my throne’?",
      "25": "Today he has gone out and sacrificed a great many cattle, specially fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. They are even eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "But he has not invited me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon.",
      "27": "Has this command about who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him really come from my lord the king, even though you have not made this known to your servants?”",
      "28": "Then King David responded, “Call Bathsheba for me.” She came in and stood before the king.",
      "29": "The king swore, “As surely as the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from every tight spot,",
      "30": "just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, that Solomon your son will be king after me and he will sit on my throne in my place, I will indeed make it happen this very day.”",
      "31": "Bathsheba knelt down on the ground and bowed before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”",
      "32": "King David said, “Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” So they came in before the king.",
      "33": "The king said to them, “Take your lord’s servants with you. Have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon Spring.",
      "34": "There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him as king over Israel. Then you are to blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "35": "Then you are to follow him, as he goes in and sits on my throne, and he will be king in my place. I decree that he will be leader over Israel and Judah.”",
      "36": "Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada responded to the king, “Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, confirm this!",
      "37": "Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may he also be with Solomon. May he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!”",
      "38": "So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went out. They had Solomon ride on the mule that belonged to King David and brought him down to Gihon Spring.",
      "39": "Then Zadok the priest took the horn of olive oil from the Tent and anointed Solomon. After that they blew the ram’s horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "40": "All the people followed Solomon. The people were playing flutes and rejoicing so greatly that the ground shook from the sound.",
      "41": "When Adonijah and all his guests heard it, they stopped eating. Joab heard the sound of the ram’s horn and asked, “Why is the noise from the city so loud?”",
      "42": "Just then, while he was still speaking, Jonathan, son of Abiathar the priest, came in. Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a worthy man, and you must be bringing good news.”",
      "43": "Jonathan responded to Adonijah:\nNot at all! Our lord King David has made Solomon king!",
      "44": "The king sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites with Solomon, and they placed him on the king’s mule.",
      "45": "Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king at Gihon, and they went up from there rejoicing. The city is in an uproar. That is the noise you have been hearing.",
      "46": "Also, Solomon has taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom.",
      "47": "The king’s servants have come to bless our lord King David, saying, “May your God treat the name of Solomon even more favorably than your name, and may his throne be greater than your throne.”\nThe king bowed in worship on his bed,",
      "48": "and the king spoke the following words: “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has provided someone to sit upon my throne and has permitted my eyes to see it.”",
      "49": "Then all of Adonijah’s guests quickly got up, and each one went his own way.",
      "50": "Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he went and held on to the horns of the altar.",
      "51": "Solomon was told, “Adonijah is so afraid of King Solomon that he has grabbed the horns of the altar, and he is saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me this day that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”",
      "52": "Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, but if he is caught planning evil, he will die.”",
      "53": "Then King Solomon had Adonijah brought down from the altar. He came in and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon told him, “Go to your house.”"

      "3": "Fulfill your duties to the Lord your God. Walk in his ways. Keep his statutes, his commands, his ordinances, and his decrees as they are written in the Law of Moses, so that you may have success in everything you do and everywhere you turn,",
      "4": "in order that the Lord may keep this word that he spoke to me: “If your sons are careful to walk before me faithfully with their whole heart and soul, then you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.”",
      "5": "Furthermore, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to two commanders of the army of Israel, to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, spilling blood in peacetime as if it were happening in war. He spattered that blood on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet, as if it were war.",
      "6": "Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace.",
      "7": "Keep faith with the sons of Barzillai from Gilead, and let them eat at your table, because they did the same for me when I fled from your brother Absalom.",
      "8": "Watch out for Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim of the tribe of Benjamin, since he is still with you. He cursed me bitterly on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, “I will not kill you with the sword.”",
      "9": "But now, do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man. You will know what you should do to him. Bring his gray hair down to the grave in blood.",
      "10": "David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.",
      "11": "David was king over Israel for forty years. He was king in Hebron for seven years, and he was king in Jerusalem for thirty-three years.",
      "12": "Solomon was seated on the throne of his father David, and his kingship was firmly established.",
      "13": "Adonijah son of Haggith came to Solomon’s mother Bathsheba. She said to him, “Do you come in peace?”\n“Yes, in peace,” he answered.",
      "14": "Then he said, “May I have a word with you?”\nShe said, “Yes. Speak up.”",
      "15": "He said, “You know that the kingship was mine, and all Israel looked for me to be king. But things changed, and the kingship went to my brother instead, because the Lord gave it to him.",
      "16": "But now, I am asking you for one request. Do not turn me away.”\nShe said, “Tell me what it is.”",
      "17": "He said, “Ask King Solomon (for he will not turn you down) to give me Abishag from Shunem as my wife.”",
      "18": "Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak to the king for you.”",
      "19": "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king met her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and also set up a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat at his right hand.",
      "20": "She said, “I am asking you for one small request. Do not turn me down.”\nThe king answered her, “Ask, mother, for I will not turn you down.”",
      "21": "She said, “Please give Abishag from Shunem to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”",
      "22": "King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you ask for Abishag from Shunem to be given to Adonijah? You might as well ask for the kingship for him. After all, he is my brother, my older brother! Yes, request it for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!”",
      "23": "Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, “May God punish me severely and double it, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request that he has made!",
      "24": "Now, as surely as the Lord lives, who has appointed me and seated me on the throne of my father David and has established my house just as he said he would, Adonijah will die today!”",
      "25": "Then King Solomon gave an order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and killed him.",
      "26": "To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to your estate in Anathoth because you deserve to die. But I will not kill you today because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before my father David and because you shared in all my father’s sufferings.”",
      "27": "So Solomon drove Abiathar out from serving as priest for the Lord to fulfill the word of the Lord which had been spoken against the house of Eli in Shiloh.",
      "28": "When the news reached Joab, he fled to the Tent of the Lord and held on to the horns of the altar, for he had supported Adonijah, although he had not supported Absalom.",
      "29": "When King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the Tent of the Lord and that he was there by the side of the altar, Solomon sent word to ⎣Joab, saying, “What happened to you that caused you to flee to the altar?” Joab said, “Because I was afraid of you, I fled to the Lord.” So Solomon sent word to⎦ Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go! Strike him down!”",
      "30": "Benaiah went to the Tent of the Lord and called to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’”\nJoab answered, “No. I will die here.”\nSo Benaiah reported back to the king, “This is what Joab said, and this is how I responded.”",
      "31": "The king said to him, “Do just as he said. Strike him dead and bury him. Remove from me and from my father’s house the blood that Joab shed without cause.",
      "32": "The Lord has brought the blood he shed back on his own head, because he struck down two men who were more righteous and better than he was. He killed them with the sword, but my father David did not know about it. The blood of Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah,",
      "33": "has come back on Joab’s head and on the heads of his descendants forever. But for David and his descendants and his house and his throne, there will be peace forever from the Lord.”",
      "34": "So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him. He buried him at his house in the wilderness.",
      "35": "Then the king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army. He placed Zadok the priest into Abiathar’s position.",
      "36": "The king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there. Do not go out of the city—ever!",
      "37": "On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure that you will die. Your blood will be on your own head.”",
      "38": "Shimei said to the king, “Your decision is good. Your servant will do just as my lord the king has said.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for some time.",
      "39": "At the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Achish son of Ma’akah, the king of Gath. Shimei was told, “Listen! Your slaves are in Gath.”",

      "41": "Solomon was told that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned.",
      "42": "The king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not swear to you by the Lord and warn you that you could be sure that on the day you dared to go out of Jerusalem you would die? And didn’t you answer me, ‘Your decision is good. I have heard what you said’?",
      "43": "Why then did you not keep your oath to the Lord and obey the command I gave you?”",
      "44": "The king also said to Shimei, “In your heart you know all the evil that you did to my father David. Now the Lord has brought your evil back on your own head.",
      "45": "Now may King Solomon be blessed, and may David’s throne be firmly established before the Lord forever.”",

      "10": "In the eyes of the Lord, Solomon’s request was good.",
      "11": "So God said to him, “Because you have asked for this, and you have not asked for a long life, nor have you asked for riches, nor have you asked for the lives of your enemies, but you have asked for discernment to reach just verdicts,",
      "12": "therefore I will act according to your words. Yes, I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you before you, nor will anyone like you rise up after you.",
