      "3": "Therefore, now you are to tell this people that this is what the Lord of Armies says to them.\nReturn to me, declares the Lord of Armies, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Armies.",
      "4": "Do not be like your forefathers, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed, “This is what the Lord of Armies says. Return, return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.”\nBut our forefathers did not listen, nor did they pay attention to me, declares the Lord.",
      "5": "Your forefathers—where are they now? And those prophets—did they go on living indefinitely?",
      "6": "But my words and my statutes, which I commanded to my servants the prophets, caught up with our forefathers, didn’t they?\nThen they returned and said, “Because of our ways and our deeds, the Lord of Armies has done to us just as he planned to do to us.”",
      "7": "On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, that is, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.",
      "8": "I saw a vision at night. In it I saw a man seated on a red horse, standing among myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.",
      "9": "So I asked, “My lord, what are these?”\nThe angel who was speaking with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.”",
      "10": "Then the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “These are the ones the Lord sent to range throughout the earth.”",
      "11": "They reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have ranged throughout the earth. Look! All the earth is resting and quiet.”",
      "12": "Then the angel of the Lord said, “Lord of Armies, how long will you withhold compassion from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom you were indignant these seventy years?”",
      "13": "The Lord responded with kind and compassionate words to the angel who was speaking with me.",
      "14": "So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, “Proclaim this. This is what the Lord of Armies says.”\nI am very zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion,",
      "15": "and I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are complacent. When I was angry only a little, they added to the evil.",
      "16": "Therefore, this is what the Lord says. I have turned to Jerusalem with compassionate feelings. My house will be built in Jerusalem, declares the Lord of Armies, and the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.",
      "17": "Proclaim also this: This is what the Lord of Armies says. Once again my towns will overflow with prosperity. Once again the Lord will console Zion. Once again he will choose Jerusalem.",

      "3": "At that moment, when the angel who was speaking with me was about to leave, another angel came to meet him and",
      "4": "said, “Run and tell this young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited as a city without walls because of the large number of people and livestock in it.",
      "5": "For I myself will be a wall of fire around it, declares the Lord, and I will be the glory within it.”",
      "6": "Attention! This is urgent! Flee from the land of the north, declares the Lord, for I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, declares the Lord.",
      "7": "Attention, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.",
      "8": "For this is what the Lord of Armies says. For the sake of his glory he sent me to the nations that plundered you, because whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye.",
      "9": "Yes, I myself will swing my hand over them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves. Then you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me.",
      "10": "Sing loudly and rejoice, daughter of Zion. Yes, look! I am coming, and I will dwell among you, declares the Lord.",
      "11": "Many nations will be joined to the Lord on that day, and they will become my people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me to you.",

      "3": "Now Joshua was clothed in filthy clothing and was standing in front of the Angel.",
      "4": "Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to those who were standing in front of him: “Remove his filthy clothing.”\nThen he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken your guilt away from you, so that I may clothe you in a special robe.”",
      "5": "I said, “Let them place a clean turban on his head.” So they placed a clean turban on his head and got him dressed, while the Angel of the Lord was standing by.",
      "6": "Then the Angel of the Lord spoke solemnly to Joshua:",
      "7": "This is what the Lord of Armies says. If you will walk in my ways and carry out my ministry, then you will also govern my house and watch over my courts, and I will give you access among those who are standing here.",
      "8": "Now listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates who sit in front of you—because these men are a sign. Look! I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.",
      "9": "Look carefully at the stone that I placed in front of Joshua! On one stone with seven facets I will engrave an inscription, declares the Lord of Armies, and I will remove the guilt of this land in a single day.",

      "3": "There are two olive trees beside it, one to the right of the bowl, and one to its left.”",
      "4": "I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”",
      "5": "The angel who was speaking with me answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”\nI answered, “No, my lord.”",
      "6": "So he said to me:\nThis is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel. Not by might, not by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of Armies.",
      "7": "What are you, you great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a level plain. Then he will bring out the capstone with shouts of “Grace! Grace be with it!”",
      "8": "Then the word of the Lord came to me:",
      "9": "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me to you.",
      "10": "For who despises the day of small things? They will rejoice to see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.\nThese seven are the eyes of the Lord that range throughout the whole earth.",
      "11": "Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees to the right and left of the lampstand?”",
      "12": "I asked him a second time, “What are the two olive branches that are beside the two gold conduits that pour out the golden oil?”",
      "13": "He said to me, “Don’t you know what these are?”\nI said, “No, my lord.”",

      "2": "He asked me, “What do you see?”\nI said, “I see a flying scroll! It is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.”",
      "3": "Then he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the face of the whole earth: On the basis of the curse, everyone who steals will be expelled in one direction, and everyone who swears falsely will be expelled in the other direction.",
      "4": "I will send it out, declares the Lord of Armies, and it will go to the house of the thief and to the house of the one who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and consume it, both wood and stone.”",
      "5": "Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me, “Lift up your eyes, now, and see what is going out.”",

      "7": "As I watched, the lead cover was lifted, and I saw that there was a woman sitting inside the basket.",
      "8": "He said, “This is Wickedness.” Then he pushed her down inside the basket, and he pushed the lead weight onto its opening.",
      "9": "Then I lifted up my eyes and looked again. There were two women coming toward me! The wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork. They lifted up the basket between the earth and the heavens.",
      "10": "So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”",
      "11": "He told me, “To build a house for it in the land of Shinar. When it is ready, it will be set there on its foundation.”"

      "3": "The third chariot had white horses. The fourth chariot had dappled horses. All of them were powerful.",

      "6": "The driver with the black horses is going toward the land of the north, and the one with the white horses is following after them, and the one with the dappled horses is going toward the land of the south.”",
      "7": "Now the powerful horses came out, and they were eager to range throughout the earth. He said, “Go! Range throughout the earth.” So they ranged throughout the earth.",
