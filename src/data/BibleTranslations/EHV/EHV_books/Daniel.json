      "1": "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.",
      "2": "The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into Nebuchadnezzar’s hand, along with some of the vessels of the House of God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar, into the house of his god. He brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.",
      "3": "The king told Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring some young Israelite men from the royal family or from the nobility.",
      "4": "He was to choose young men who had no blemish, who were good looking, who had insight into all kinds of wisdom, who possessed knowledge, understanding, and learning, and who were capable of serving in the king’s palace, in order to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.",
      "5": "The king assigned them daily rations from the special royal food and from the king’s own wine. He ordered that they should be trained for three years. At the end of training they were to serve the king.",
      "6": "In this group of young men were the Judeans Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",
      "7": "The chief of the officials gave them new names. He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar, Hananiah the name Shadrak, Mishael the name Meshak, and Azariah the name Abednego.",
      "8": "Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the special food of the king or with the wine that he drank. So he sought permission from the chief official, so that he would not have to defile himself.",
      "9": "God made the chief of the officials favorable and sympathetic toward Daniel.",
      "10": "Then the chief of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink. Why should he see your faces looking less healthy than those of the other young men who are your age? You put my life at risk before the king.”",
      "11": "Daniel said to the superintendent whom the chief of the officials had placed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
      "12": "“Please test your servants for ten days. Tell them to give us only vegetables, and we will eat them and drink water.",
      "13": "Observe our appearance and the appearance of the young men who eat the special royal food. Then deal with your servants based on what you see.”",
      "14": "So he listened to what they said about this and tested them for ten days.",
      "15": "At the end of ten days, their appearance was noticeably better than that of the others. They were healthier than any of the young men who had been eating the special royal food.",
      "16": "So the superintendent permanently took away the special royal food and the wine they were to drink and gave them only vegetables.",
      "17": "As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and insight into all kinds of literature, as well as wisdom. In addition, Daniel also understood every kind of vision and dream.",
      "18": "At the end of the time which the king had set for them to be brought to him, the chief of the officials brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "19": "The king spoke with them, and none of the others were found to be comparable to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they served the king.",
      "20": "In every matter concerning wisdom and understanding that the king sought from them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and spell casters in his entire kingdom.",
      "21": "So Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus."

    "2": {
      "1": "In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had a dream. His spirit was troubled, but he fell back to sleep again.",
      "2": "The king gave orders to summon the magicians, the spell casters, the sorcerers, and the astrologers to relate the king’s dream to him. So they came and stood before the king.",
      "3": "The king said to them, “I had a dream, and my spirit was troubled because I did not understand the dream.”",
      "4": "The astrologers said to the king in Aramaic, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will explain its meaning.”",
      "5": "The king answered the astrologers, “My decision is final. If you do not tell me the dream and what it means, your body shall be cut to pieces, and your houses will be made into a pile of rubble.",
      "6": "However, if you explain the dream and its meaning, you will receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me. So, explain to me the dream and its meaning!”",
      "7": "They responded a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will explain its meaning.”",
      "8": "The king answered, “Now I know for sure that you are buying time because you see that my decision is final.",
      "9": "If you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. You have conspired to give me a lying and cheating response until the situation changes. So, tell me the dream, and I will know that you are also able to explain its meaning to me.”",
      "10": "The astrologers responded to the king, “There is no person on earth who is able to reveal what the king wants. No great and powerful king has ever asked for a thing like this from any magician, spell caster, or astrologer.",
      "11": "The thing that the king is asking is difficult. There is no one who can reveal it to the king except the gods, who do not dwell with mortal flesh.”",
      "12": "Because of this the king became very angry. He was enraged and gave orders to put the wise men of Babylon to death.",
      "13": "The decree was issued that all the wise men were to be executed. So executioners looked for Daniel and his companions to execute them.",
      "14": "Then Daniel responded with good judgment and tact to Ariok, the chief of the king’s executioners, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.",
      "15": "He said to Ariok, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” So Ariok explained the situation to Daniel.",
      "16": "Daniel then entered the court and asked the king to give him time so that he could reveal the interpretation to the king.",
      "17": "Next, Daniel went to his house and explained the situation to Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, his companions.",
      "18": "They were to seek mercy from the God of Heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions would not be put to death with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.",
      "20": "Daniel said,\nMay the name of God be blessed forever and ever,\nbecause wisdom and power are his.",
      "21": "He changes times and eras.\nHe removes kings,\nand he brings kings to power.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\nand knowledge to those who have good judgment.",
      "22": "He reveals deep things and hidden things.\nHe knows what is in the dark,\nand the light dwells with him.",
      "23": "To you, God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, because you have given me wisdom and power. Now you have made known to me what we requested from you, because you have made known to us the thing the king asked about.",
      "24": "As a result of this, Daniel went to Ariok, whom the king had assigned to put the wise men of Babylon to death. Daniel went and said this to him: “Do not put the wise men of Babylon to death. Bring me before the king, and I will explain the meaning to the king.”",
      "25": "Then Ariok immediately brought Daniel before the king. This is what Ariok said to the king: “I have found a man from among the Judean exiles who will make the interpretation known to the king.”",
      "26": "The king said to Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar), “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I saw and its meaning?”",
      "27": "Daniel answered the king, “The mystery that the king is asking about, no wise men, spell casters, magicians, or diviners are able to explain it to the king.",
      "28": "However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. This is your dream; the visions in your head while you were on your bed were this:",
      "29": "For you, Your Majesty, while you were on your bed, thoughts arose about things that will come after this, and the Revealer of Mysteries made known to you what will happen.",
      "30": "But the reason that this mystery was revealed to me was not because I have more wisdom in me than any other living being. Rather, it was revealed to me so that the meaning could be made known to Your Majesty and so that you may know the thoughts of your heart.",
      "31": "You, Your Majesty, were looking, and there was a very great statue. That statue, which was large and extremely bright, was standing in front of you. Its appearance was frightening.",
      "32": "The statue looked like this: Its head was fine gold, its chest and its arms were silver, its abdomen and its thighs were bronze,",
      "33": "its shins were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay.",
      "34": "You continued to watch until a stone was cut, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet that were iron and clay, and it smashed them.",
      "35": "Then all at once the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed and became like the chaff on the threshing floors of summer. The wind carried them away, and no trace of them could be found. However, the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the entire earth.",
      "36": "This is the dream.\nSo now we will interpret its meaning for Your Majesty.",
      "37": "You, Your Majesty, are the king of kings to whom the God of Heaven has given a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.",
      "38": "Wherever there are people, wild animals, and birds of the air, God has given them into your hand, and he has made you ruler over all of them. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "After you another kingdom will arise that will be inferior to yours. Then another kingdom, a third kingdom of bronze will arise. This kingdom will rule the entire earth.",
      "40": "A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron, since iron crushes and shatters everything. So, like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all of these other kingdoms.",
      "41": "Because you saw feet and toes partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, this will be a divided kingdom. It will have some of the hardness of iron, because you saw iron mixed with common clay.",
      "42": "What is more, the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay. This means that part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle.",
      "43": "You saw iron mixed with common clay. This means that the different parts of the kingdom will be a mixture of different races of people, and they will not remain united to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.",
      "44": "In the days of those kings, the God of Heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another race of people. It will crush and put an end to all of these kingdoms, but it will stand forever,",
      "45": "just as you saw that a stone was cut from the mountain, but not by human hands, and it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to Your Majesty what will happen after this. The dream is sure, and its interpretation is certain.",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown and paid homage to Daniel. He commanded that a sacrificial gift and incense be offered to him.",
      "47": "The king said, “Truly your God is the God of Gods, the Lord of Kings, and the Revealer of Mysteries, because you were able to reveal this mystery.”",
      "48": "Then the king promoted Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "When Daniel requested it, the king appointed Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. Daniel remained in the royal court."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue. It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide. He set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
      "2": "King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all of the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "3": "Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all of the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of King Nebuchadnezzar’s statue. They stood in front of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "4": "The herald called out loudly, “To you peoples, nations, and languages, this command is given:",
      "5": "When you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the harp, the triangular harp, the drum, and all kinds of musical instruments, you will fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar set up.",
      "6": "Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.”",
      "7": "Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the harp, the triangular harp, and all kinds of musical instruments, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshipped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
      "8": "At that time, some Chaldeans approached the king and maliciously accused the Jews.",
      "9": "They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Your Majesty, may you live forever!",
      "10": "You, Your Majesty, gave an order that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the harp, the triangular harp, the drum, and all kinds of musical instruments must fall down and worship the golden statue,",
      "11": "and whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.",
      "12": "There are Jews whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely, Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego. These men do not pay attention to you, Your Majesty. They do not serve your gods, and they do not worship the gold statue that you set up.”",
      "13": "Then in a furious rage Nebuchadnezzar said to bring Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king.",
      "14": "Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods and that you do not worship the golden statue that I set up?",
      "15": "Now, if you are ready, at the time when you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the harp, the triangular harp, the drum, and all kinds of musical instruments, you must fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace. What god will be able to save you from my hands?”",
      "16": "Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need to answer you about this matter.",
      "17": "Since our God, whom we serve, does exist, he is able to save us from the blazing fiery furnace. So, he may save us from your hand, Your Majesty.",
      "18": "But if he does not, you should know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods, and we will not worship the golden statue that you set up.”",
      "19": "Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed against Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego. He said to heat the furnace seven times hotter than it was usually heated.",
      "20": "He ordered some men, who were soldiers from his army, to bind Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego in order to throw them into the blazing fiery furnace.",
      "21": "So these men were bound in their coats, their pants, their turbans, and their other clothing, and they were thrown into the middle of the blazing fiery furnace.",
      "22": "Because the king’s order was urgent and the furnace was extremely hot, those men who carried Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego were killed by the intense heat of the fire.",
      "23": "But these three men, Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego, who had been tied up, fell into the blazing fiery furnace.",
      "24": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar was startled and immediately stood up. He said to his advisors, “Didn’t we throw three men, who had been tied up, into the middle of the fire?”\nThey answered the king, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”",
      "25": "He said, “Look! I see four men, who are untied and walking around in the middle of the fire, unharmed. What is more, the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”",
      "26": "Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing fiery furnace. He said, “Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out!” Then Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego came out from the middle of the furnace.",
      "27": "The satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the royal advisors gathered together and looked at these men. The fire had no power over their bodies. Not a hair on their head was singed, their robes were not damaged, and the smell of fire had not stuck to them.",
      "28": "Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego, who sent his angel and saved his servants, who trusted in God and ignored the king’s command. They gave up their bodies and did not pay homage or worship any god except their God.",
      "29": "So I have issued an order that every people, nation, and language that speaks any blasphemy against the God of Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego shall be cut to pieces, and his house shall be turned into a pile of rubble, because there is no other god who is able to save like this.”",
      "30": "Then the king promoted Shadrak, Meshak, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."

      "1": "From King Nebuchadnezzar:\nTo all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell on the entire earth:\nMay your peace and prosperity increase.",

      "3": "How great are his signs!\n    How mighty are his wonders!\n    His kingdom is an eternal kingdom,\n    and his dominion extends from generation to generation.",
      "4": "When I, Nebuchadnezzar, was carefree in my house and prospering in my palace,",
      "5": "I saw a dream that frightened me. The images I saw while I was on my bed and the visions in my head alarmed me.",
      "6": "So I issued a decree to bring before me all of the wise men of Babylon so that they could give the interpretation of the dream and make it known to me.",
      "7": "Then the magicians, the spell casters, the astrologers, and the diviners came, and I told them the dream. However, they could not make its meaning known to me.",
      "8": "Afterward, Daniel came before me (whose name is Belteshazzar, like the name of my god, and a spirit of the holy gods dwells in him), and I told him the dream.",
      "9": "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that a spirit of the holy gods dwells in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you, take a look at the dream I saw and interpret it for me.",
      "10": "I was seeing visions in my head while I was on my bed:\nThere was a tree standing in the middle of the earth, and its height was great.",
      "11": "The tree grew and became strong. Its height reached to heaven, and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.",
      "12": "Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit was plentiful. On it there was enough food for all. Under the tree the wild animals had shade, and the birds of the air lived in its branches. All living creatures fed themselves from it.",
      "13": "I was on my bed, watching the visions in my head, and I saw a watcher, who was a holy one, come down from heaven.",
      "14": "He called out loudly, and this is what he said:\nChop down the tree and cut off its branches. Strip its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.",
      "15": "However, leave the stump with its root in the ground, with an iron and bronze band around it. Leave it with the grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew from the sky. Let its place be with the animals among the plants of the earth.",
      "16": "Let its mind be changed from that of a human, let the mind of an animal be given to it, and let seven times pass over it.",
      "17": "The proclamation is a decree of the watchers, and the matter is a command of the holy ones, so that all the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdoms of men. He gives them to whomever he wishes, and he appoints the lowliest men over them.",
      "18": "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now, you, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, because none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to make the meaning known to me. But you are able, because a spirit of the holy gods is in you.",
      "19": "Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was horrified for a moment, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream and its meaning trouble you.”\nBelteshazzar answered, “My Lord, if only the dream were about your enemies and its meaning about your foes!”",
      "20": "The tree which you saw grew and became strong. Its height reached to heaven, and it was visible to the whole earth.",
      "21": "Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit was abundant. On it there was food for all. The wild animals lived under it, and the birds of the air lived in its branches.",
      "22": "You are the tree, Your Majesty. For you have grown, and you have become great. Your greatness has increased and reached to heaven. Your dominion reaches to the ends of the earth.",
      "23": "And you, Your Majesty, saw a watcher, who was a holy one, coming down from heaven, and he said, “Chop down the tree and destroy it. However, leave the stump with its roots in the ground, with an iron and bronze band around it. Let it be with the grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew from the sky. Its place will be with the wild animals, until seven times pass over it.”",
      "24": "This is the interpretation, Your Majesty:\nIt is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord, the king.",
      "25": "You will be driven away from humans, and your dwelling will be with the wild animals. You will have to eat plants as bulls do, and you will be wet with the dew from the sky. Seven times will pass over you until you know that the Most High rules the kingdoms of men, and he gives them to whomever he wishes.",
      "26": "Because they said to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will remain yours when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.",
      "27": "Therefore, Your Majesty, let my advice be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins with righteousness and from your guilty deeds by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be extended.",
      "28": "All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "29": "At the end of twelve months he was walking on top of the palace of his kingdom in Babylon.",
      "30": "The king said, “Isn’t this the great Babylon that I built for a royal residence by my mighty power and my majestic glory?”",
      "31": "While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven. It said, “It is announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar: The kingdom has been taken away from you.",
      "32": "You will be driven away from humans, and your dwelling will be with the wild animals. Grass will be fed to you as grass is fed to bulls, and seven times will pass over you until you know that the Most High rules the kingdoms of men, and he gives them to whomever he wishes.”",
      "33": "Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven away from humans. So he ate grass as bulls do, and his body was wet with the dew from the sky until his hair grew long like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.",
      "34": "At the end of the set time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me. So I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified the one who lives forever, because his dominion is an eternal dominion, and his kingdom lasts forever and ever.",
      "35": "All of the inhabitants of the earth are considered to be nothing, and he does as he wishes with the army of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. So there is no one who can hold back the hand of the Most High and say to him, “What have you done?”",
      "36": "At that time my reason returned to me, and my splendor and glory returned to me for the honor of my kingdom. So my advisors and nobles looked for me. I was reinstated over my kingdom, and I became even more majestic than I was before.",
      "37": "Now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and honor the King of Heaven, because all his works are true, and his ways are just. All those who walk in arrogance he is able to humble."

      "3": "Then they brought the gold vessels that they had taken from the temple, that is, the House of God in Jerusalem. So the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.",
      "4": "They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone.",
      "5": "At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, opposite the lampstand, and the king saw the back of the hand that was writing.",
      "6": "Then the king’s cheerful appearance changed, his face grew pale, and his thoughts troubled him. His legs went limp, and his knees knocked together.",
      "7": "The king called out loudly to bring the spell casters, the astrologers, and the diviners. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever is able to read this writing and explain its meaning will be clothed in purple, with a gold chain around his neck, and he will rule as third highest in the kingdom.”",
      "8": "Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they were not able to read the writing or tell the king what it meant.",
      "9": "Then King Belshazzar was really terrified. He grew even paler, and his nobles were perplexed.",

      "11": "There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, enlightenment, insight, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. So King Nebuchadnezzar your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, spell casters, astrologers, and diviners,",
      "12": "because an outstanding spirit and knowledge and insight in interpreting dreams and explaining riddles and solving knotty problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be summoned, and he will explain the meaning of the writing.”",
      "13": "Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to Daniel, “Are you Daniel, one of the Judean exiles whom my father the king brought from Judah?",
      "14": "I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and enlightenment and insight and outstanding wisdom are found in you.",
      "15": "Now, those wise men who are the spell casters were brought before me to read this writing and to make its meaning known to me, but they were not able to explain the meaning of the message.",
      "16": "Yet I have heard about you that you are able to explain meanings clearly and to solve knotty problems. Therefore, if you are able to read the writing and make its meaning known to me, you will be clothed in purple, with a gold chain around your neck, and you will rule as the third in the kingdom.”",
      "17": "Then Daniel answered the king:\nKeep your gifts for yourself, or give your rewards to someone else! Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king, and I will make its meaning known to him.",
      "18": "As for you, Your Majesty—the Most High God gave the kingdom, greatness, splendor, and glory to Nebuchadnezzar, your father.",
      "19": "So because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and were afraid in his presence. He killed whomever he wanted, and he let live whomever he wanted. Also, he promoted anyone he wanted, and he demoted anyone he wanted.",

He was fed grass as bulls are fed, and his body was wet with dew from the sky, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdoms of men, and he raises up over them anyone he desires.",

Then you praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, who do not see and do not hear and do not know. But you did not honor the God who holds your breath in his hand and who controls all your ways.",

However, they were unable to come up with an accusation or any evidence of corruption, because he was trustworthy and no neglect of duty or evidence of corruption could be found against him.",

Three times each day he would get on his knees and pray and offer praise before his God. He continued to do that, just as he had been doing before this.",

The order is established as a law of the Medes and the Persians that cannot be revoked.”",

      "20": "As he came near the pit, he cried out in a fearful voice. The king said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God, whom you serve continually, able to rescue you from the lions?”",
      "21": "Then Daniel spoke with the king. “Your Majesty, may you live forever!",
      "22": "My God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions. They have not hurt me because he found me innocent in his presence. Also before you, Your Majesty, I have committed no crime.”",
      "23": "Then the king was very glad and said that Daniel should be brought up from the pit. So Daniel was brought up from the pit, and he was unharmed because he trusted in his God.",
      "24": "The king gave the order, and those men who maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions’ den—they, their children, and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the pit when the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.",

It devoured and crushed. With its feet it trampled whatever was left. Now it was different from all the beasts that came before it. It had ten horns.",
      "8": "I was thinking about the horns when suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them. Three of the horns that had already been there were uprooted to make room for it. I noticed eyes like human eyes on that horn, and it had a mouth which was speaking boastfully.",

What is more, that horn had eyes and a mouth that was speaking boastful things. Its appearance was greater than that of the other horns that were with it.",
