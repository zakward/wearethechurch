      "6": "For this reason I am reminding you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.",
      "7": "For God did not give us a timid spirit, but a spirit of power and love and sound judgment.",
      "8": "So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Instead, join with me in suffering for the gospel while relying on the power of God.",
      "9": "He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began,",
      "10": "and it has now been revealed through the appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.",
      "11": "For this gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles,",

      "16": "As for pointless chatter, avoid it, for it will lead to an ever greater measure of godlessness,",
      "17": "and their message will spread like gangrene. This includes Hymenaeus and Philetus,",
      "18": "who have veered away from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are overturning the faith of some.",

      "3": "unloving, not able to reconcile with others, slanderous, without self-control, savage, haters of what is good,",
      "4": "treacherous, reckless, puffed up with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,",
      "5": "holding to an outward form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such people.",
