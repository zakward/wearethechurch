      "12": "But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number, and the more they spread out. The Egyptians were filled with dread because of them.",

      "16": "He said, “When you help the Hebrew women give birth, while they are still on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a son, you are to kill him, but if you see that it is a daughter, let her live.”",

      "11": "After some time, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their forced labor. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own people.",
      "12": "After he looked this way and that, and he saw that no one was there, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.",
      "13": "The next day when he went out, he came upon two Hebrew men who were fighting. He said to the one in the wrong, “Why were you striking your fellow Hebrew?”",
      "14": "The man said, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me just as you killed the Egyptian?”\nMoses was afraid and thought, “What I have done has definitely become known.”",

      "18": "When the daughters came to Reuel, their father, he said, “Why have you returned so early today?”",
      "19": "They said, “An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”",
      "20": "Reuel said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why have you left the man there? Invite him to have something to eat.”",
      "21": "Moses agreed to stay with the man. The man gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as a wife.",
      "22": "She gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, for he said, “I have become an alien living in a foreign land.”",
      "23": "After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of their slavery. They cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.",

      "9": "Now indeed, the Israelites’ cry for help has come to me. Yes, I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them.",
      "10": "Come now, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”",
      "11": "But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”",

      "15": "God also told Moses, “Say this to the Israelites: ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation.’",
      "16": "“Go, gather the elders of Israel together and tell them: ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have certainly been paying attention to you and to what they have done to you in Egypt.",
      "17": "So I have said that I will bring you up from the misery in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’",
      "18": "“They will listen to your voice. Then you and the elders of Israel will go to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the Lord, our God.’",
      "19": "“But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless he is forced to do so by a powerful hand.",
      "20": "So I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in their midst. Afterward he will let you go.",

      "3": "He said, “Throw it on the ground.”\nMoses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, so he ran away from it.",
      "4": "The Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand and take it by the tail.”\nHe stretched out his hand and took hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand.",
      "5": "The Lord said, “This sign is being given to you so that the Israelites will believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”",

      "11": "So the Lord said to him, “Who made a mouth for people? Or who makes someone mute or deaf, able to see or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?",
      "12": "Now go, and I will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you will speak.”",
      "13": "But he said, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”",

      "15": "You will speak to him and put the words into his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his, and I will teach you what you are to do.",
      "16": "He will speak to the people for you so that it will be as if he were your mouth, and you were God to him.",
      "17": "You will also take this staff in your hand, the one with which you will perform the signs.”",
      "18": "Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Let me go and return to my own people, who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.”\nJethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”",
      "19": "The Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt, for everyone who wanted to kill you is dead.”",
      "20": "So Moses took his wife and his sons, placed them on a donkey, and set out to return to the land of Egypt. Moses took the staff of God in his hand.",
      "21": "The Lord said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, make sure that you perform in the presence of Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put into your hand. However, I will make his heart hard, and he will not let the people go.",
      "22": "You will then say to Pharaoh, ‘The Lord says: Israel is my son, my firstborn,",
      "23": "and I have said to you, “Let my son go to serve me,” but you have refused to let him go. Watch out. I will kill your son, your firstborn.’”",
      "24": "At a lodging place along the way, the Lord confronted him and sought to kill him.",
      "25": "Then Zipporah took a flint blade, cut off her son’s foreskin, and cast it at his feet. Then she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”",
      "26": "So the Lord left him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)",
      "27": "The Lord had said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.”\nSo he went, met Moses at the mountain of God, and kissed him.",
      "28": "Moses told Aaron all the words that the Lord had sent him to speak and all the signs he had commanded him to perform.",

      "30": "Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses and performed the signs in the sight of the people.",

      "16": "No straw is given to your servants, yet they tell us, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”",
      "17": "But he said, “Lazy! You are lazy! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’",
