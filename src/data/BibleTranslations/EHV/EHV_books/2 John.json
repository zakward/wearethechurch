      "1": "The Elder,\nTo the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—not only I, but also everyone who knows the truth—",
      "2": "because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever:",
      "3": "Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, in truth and love.",
      "4": "I was overjoyed to find out that some of your children are walking in the truth, in keeping with the command we received from the Father.",
      "5": "And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing a new command to you, but the one we have had from the beginning—let us love one another.",
      "6": "And this is love: that we walk according to his commands. This is the command: Just as you have heard from the beginning, keep on walking in it.",
      "7": "Many deceivers who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh have gone out into the world. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.",
      "8": "Watch yourselves so that you do not lose what we have labored for but receive a full reward.",
      "9": "Anyone who goes on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son.",
      "10": "If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house. Do not even wish him well.",
      "11": "For the one who wishes him well shares in his wicked works.",
      "12": "I have many things to write to you, but I did not want to do it with paper and ink. I hope instead to be with you and speak to you face to face so that our joy may be made complete.",
      "13": "The children of your chosen sister greet you."
