      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He was with God in the beginning.",
      "3": "Through him everything was made, and without him not one thing was made that has been made.",
      "4": "In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.",
      "5": "The light is shining in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.",
      "6": "There was a man, sent from God, whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came as an eyewitness to testify about the light so that everyone would believe through him.",
      "8": "He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.",
      "9": "The real light that shines on everyone was coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not recognize him.",
      "11": "He came to what was his own, yet his own people did not accept him.",
      "12": "But to all who did receive him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.",
      "13": "They were born, not of blood, or of the desire of the flesh, or of a husband’s will, but born of God.",
      "14": "The Word became flesh and dwelled among us. We have seen his glory, the glory he has as the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John testified about him. He cried out, “This was the one I spoke about when I said, ‘The one coming after me outranks me because he existed before me.’”",
      "16": "For out of his fullness we have all received grace upon grace.",
      "17": "For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has ever seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is close to the Father’s side, has made him known.",
      "19": "This is the testimony John gave when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He confessed and did not deny. He confessed, “I am not the Christ.”",
      "21": "And they asked him, “Who are you then? Are you Elijah?”\nHe said, “I am not.”\n“Are you the Prophet?”\n“No,” he answered.",
      "22": "Then they asked him, “Who are you? Tell us so we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”",
      "24": "They had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "So they asked John, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”",
      "26": "“I baptize with water,” John answered. “Among you stands one you do not know.",
      "27": "He is the one coming after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.”",
      "28": "These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘The one coming after me outranks me because he existed before me.’",
      "31": "I myself did not know who he was, but I came baptizing with water so that he would be revealed to Israel.”",
      "32": "John also testified, “I saw the Spirit descend like a dove from heaven and remain on him.",
      "33": "I myself did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I saw this myself and have testified that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "The next day, John was standing there again with two of his disciples.",
      "36": "When John saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "When Jesus turned around and saw them following him, he asked, “What are you looking for?”\nThey said to him, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”",
      "39": "He told them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying. They stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.",
      "41": "The first thing Andrew did was to find his own brother Simon and say to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “the Christ”).",
      "42": "He brought him to Jesus.\nLooking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon, son of Jonah. You will be called Cephas” (which means “Peter”).",
      "43": "The next day, Jesus wanted to leave for Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”",
      "46": "Nathanael said to him, “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?”\n“Come and see!” Philip told him.",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Truly, here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”",
      "48": "Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?”\nJesus answered, “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus replied, “You believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that!”",
      "51": "Then he added, “Amen, Amen, I tell you: You will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "Three days later, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there.",
      "2": "Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”",
      "4": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My time has not come yet.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”",
      "6": "Six stone water jars, which the Jews used for ceremonial cleansing, were standing there, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.",
      "7": "Jesus told them, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim.",
      "8": "Then he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” And they did.",
      "9": "When the master of the banquet tasted the water that had now become wine, he did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew). The master of the banquet called the bridegroom",
      "10": "and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have had plenty to drink, then the cheaper wine. You saved the good wine until now!”",
      "11": "This, the beginning of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
      "12": "After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.",
      "13": "The Jewish Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers sitting at tables.",
      "15": "He made a whip of cords and drove everyone out of the temple courts, along with the sheep and oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.",
      "16": "To those selling doves he said, “Get these things out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a place of business!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "So the Jews responded, “What sign are you going to show us to prove you can do these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”",
      "20": "The Jews said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! And you are going to raise it in three days?”",
      "21": "But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body.",
      "22": "When Jesus was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and what Jesus had said.",
      "23": "While he was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many believed in his name as they observed the miraculous signs he was doing.",
      "24": "But Jesus, on his part, was not entrusting himself to them, because he knew them all.",
      "25": "He did not need anyone to testify about man, because he himself knew what was in man."

    "3": {
      "1": "There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.",
      "2": "He came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do these miraculous signs you are doing unless God is with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus replied, “Amen, Amen, I tell you: Unless someone is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Amen, Amen, I tell you: Unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God!",
      "6": "Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh. Whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be surprised when I tell you that you must be born from above.",
      "8": "The wind blows where it pleases. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "“How can these things be?” asked Nicodemus.",
      "10": "“You are the teacher of Israel,” Jesus answered, “and you do not know these things?",
      "11": "Amen, Amen, I tell you: We speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen. But you people do not accept our testimony.",
      "12": "If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended into heaven, except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.",
      "14": "“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,",
      "15": "so that everyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.",
      "18": "The one who believes in him is not condemned, but the one who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.",
      "19": "This is the basis for the judgment: The light has come into the world, yet people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "In fact, everyone who practices wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light, or else his deeds would be exposed.",
      "21": "But the one who does what is true comes toward the light, in order that his deeds may be seen as having been done in connection with God.”",
      "22": "After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside where he spent some time with them and was baptizing.",
      "23": "John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,",
      "24": "for John had not been thrown into prison yet.",
      "25": "Then an argument broke out between John’s disciples and a certain Jew about purification.",
      "26": "His disciples came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him!”",
      "27": "John answered, “A man cannot receive a single thing, unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves are witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’",
      "29": "The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens for him, is overjoyed when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is now complete.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.”",
      "31": "The one who comes from above is superior to everyone. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in a way that belongs to the earth. The one who comes from heaven is superior to everyone.",
      "32": "He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony.",
      "33": "The one who has received his testimony has certified that God is true.",
      "34": "In fact, the one whom God has sent speaks God’s words, for God gives the Spirit without measure.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.",
      "36": "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son will not see life; instead, God’s wrath remains on him."

      "1": "Jesus found out that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John,",
      "2": "though it was not Jesus himself who was baptizing but his disciples.",
      "3": "So he left Judea and went back again to Galilee.",
      "4": "He had to go through Samaria.",
      "5": "So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there. Then Jesus, being tired from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”",
      "8": "(His disciples had gone into town to buy food.)",
      "9": "The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)",
      "10": "Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "“Sir,” she said, “you don’t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. So where do you get this living water?",
      "12": "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you? He gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his animals.”",
      "13": "Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,",
      "14": "but whoever drinks the water I will give him will never be thirsty ever again. Rather, the water I will give him will become in him a spring of water, bubbling up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "“Sir, give me this water,” the woman said to him, “so I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”",
      "16": "Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband, and come back here.”",
      "17": "“I have no husband,” the woman answered.\nJesus said to her, “You are right when you say, ‘I have no husband.’",
      "18": "In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.”",
      "19": "“Sir,” the woman replied, “I see that you are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews insist that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But a time is coming and now is here when the real worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for those are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ). “When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”",

      "27": "Just then his disciples returned and were surprised that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking to her?”",
      "28": "Then the woman left her water jar and went back into town. She said to the people,",
      "29": "“Come, see the man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”",
      "30": "They left the town and came to him.",
      "31": "Meanwhile, the disciples kept urging him, “Rabbi, eat.”",
      "32": "But Jesus said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”",
      "33": "Then the disciples said to each other, “Did anyone bring him something to eat?”",
      "34": "Jesus told them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘Four more months and the harvest will be here’? Pay attention to what I am telling you. Open your eyes and look at the fields, because they are already ripe for harvest.",
      "36": "The reaper is getting paid and is gathering grain for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.",
      "37": "Indeed in this case the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap a harvest for which you did no hard work. Others have done the hard work, and you have benefitted from their labor.”",
      "39": "Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony: “He told me everything I ever did.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more believed because of his message.",

      "43": "After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.",
      "44": "Now Jesus himself had testified that a prophet is not honored in his own country.",

      "46": "Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine.\nIn Capernaum, there was a certain royal official whose son was sick.",
      "47": "When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, because his son was about to die.",
      "48": "Jesus told him, “Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders, you certainly will not believe.”",
      "49": "The royal official said to him, “Lord, come down before my little boy dies.”",
      "50": "“Go,” Jesus told him, “your son is going to live.”\nThe man believed this word that Jesus spoke to him and left.",
      "51": "Already as he was going down, his servants met him with the news that his boy was going to live.",
      "52": "So he asked them what time his son got better. They told him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”",
      "53": "Then the father realized that was the exact time when Jesus had told him, “Your son is going to live.” And he himself and his whole household believed.",

      "2": "Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool, called Bethesda in Aramaic, which has five colonnades.",
      "3": "Within these lay a large number of sick people—blind, lame, or paralyzed—who were waiting for the movement of the water.",
      "4": "For an angel would go down at certain times into the pool and stir up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.",
      "5": "One man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had already been sick a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”",
      "7": "“Sir,” the sick man answered, “I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I’m going, someone else goes down ahead of me.”",

      "9": "Instantly the man was healed. He picked up his mat and walked.\nThat day was the Sabbath.",
      "10": "So the Jews told the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! You are not permitted to carry your mat.”",
      "11": "He answered them, “The one who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”",
      "12": "Then they asked him, “Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”",
      "13": "But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.",
      "14": "Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Look, you are well now. Do not sin anymore so that nothing worse happens to you.”",
      "15": "The man went back and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well.",
      "16": "So the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working right up to the present time, and I am working too.”",
      "18": "This is why the Jews tried all the more to kill him, because he was not merely breaking the Sabbath, but was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Jesus answered them directly, “Amen, Amen, I tell you: The Son can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. Indeed, the Son does exactly what the Father does.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And he will show him even greater works than these so that you will be amazed.",
      "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he wishes.",
      "22": "“In fact, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,",
      "23": "so that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.",

      "28": "“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice",
      "29": "and will come out. Those who have done good will rise to live, but those who have practiced evil will rise to be condemned.",
      "30": "I can do nothing at all on my own. I judge only as I hear. And my judgment is just, for I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.",
