      "2": "The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah,",
      "3": "and continued through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, up to the time of the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.",
      "4": "The word of the Lord came to me.",
      "5": "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you,\nand before you were born, I set you apart.\nI appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.",
      "6": "But I said, “Ah, Lord God! I really do not know how to speak! I am only a child!”",
      "7": "The Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am only a child.’ You must go to everyone to whom I send you and say whatever I command you.",
      "8": "Do not be afraid of them, because I am with you, and I will rescue you, declares the Lord.”",
      "9": "Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. The Lord said to me:\nThere! I have now placed my words in your mouth.",
      "10": "Look, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms\nto uproot and to tear down,\nto destroy and to overthrow,\nto build and to plant.",
      "11": "Again the word of the Lord came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?”\nI answered, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”",
      "12": "The Lord said to me, “That is correct. You have observed accurately. And this vision means that I am watching over my word to fulfill it.”",
      "13": "The word of the Lord came to me a second time: “What do you see?”\nI answered, “I see a boiling pot tipped away from the north.”",
      "14": "Then the Lord said to me:\nDisaster will boil over from the north on everyone who lives in the land.",
      "15": "Listen, I am summoning all the clans from the northern kingdoms, declares the Lord. They will come, and each one will set up his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem. They will come against all the surrounding walls and against all the cities of Judah.",
      "16": "I will pronounce my judgments against Judah because of their wickedness. They have abandoned me. They have made burnt offerings to other gods, and they have bowed down to the work of their own hands.",
      "17": "Now you, get ready. Rise up and tell them everything I am commanding you. Do not be frightened by them, or I will frighten you in their presence.",
      "18": "Look, today I have made you like a fortified city, like an iron pillar, and like bronze walls, to take a stand against the whole land. Stand against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.",

      "5": "this is what the Lord says.\nWhat fault did your fathers find in me,\nthat they departed so far from me?\nThey followed worthless idols,\nand so they became worthless themselves.",
      "6": "They did not say,\n“Where is the Lord, who brought us up from the land of Egypt?\nWhere is the one who led us through the wilderness,\n    through a desert wasteland filled with ravines,\n    through a land of drought and the shadow of death,\n    a land which no one passes through,\n    a land where no human being lives?”",

      "15": "Young lions have roared at him.\nThey have growled loudly.\nThey have made his land desolate.\nHis towns are burned and deserted.",
      "16": "The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\n    have shaved the top of your head.",
      "17": "Have you not brought this on yourself\n    by deserting the Lord your God\n    while he led you on the way?",
      "18": "So why are you on the road to Egypt\n    to drink the water of the Shihor?\nAnd why are you on the road to Assyria\n    to drink the water of the River?",
      "19": "It is your own evil that will bring discipline on you.\nYour backsliding will judge you.\nKnow and see how evil and bitter it is for you\n    to forsake the Lord your God,\n    to have no fear of me,\ndeclares the Lord God of Armies.",

      "21": "But I planted you as a very good vine,\nhealthy and from reliable stock.\nHow then did you turn against me?\nHow then did you turn into a wild vine?",
      "22": "Even if you scrub yourself with cleanser\nand use a lot of strong soap,\nthe stain of your guilt is before me, declares the Lord.",
      "23": "How can you say, “I have not defiled myself.\nI have not gone after the Baals”?\nLook what you did in the valley!\nThink about what you did!\nYou were a fast female camel\n    running wildly all over the place,",
      "24": "or a wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness,\n    sniffing the wind in her passion.\nWho can control her when she is in heat?\nNone of the males who pursue her will become tired.\nThey will find her in her mating time.",
      "25": "Stop before your shoes wear out\nand your throat becomes dry!\nBut you say, “It’s hopeless!\nI love strange gods, and I must pursue them.”",
      "26": "As a thief is shamed when he is caught,\nso the house of Israel will be shamed—\nthe people, their kings, their officials,\ntheir priests, and their prophets.",
      "27": "They say to wood, “You are my father.”\nThey say to stone, “You gave birth to me.”\nThey have turned their backs to me\nand not their faces.\nBut when a time of trouble comes, they say,\n“Get up and save us!”",
      "28": "Where are the gods you made for yourselves?\nLet them rise up,\nif they are able to save you in a time of trouble.\nAfter all, Judah, you have as many gods as you have towns.",
      "29": "Why do you bring charges against me?\nYou have all rebelled against me, declares the Lord.",
      "30": "I punished your people in vain.\nThey did not respond to correction.\nYour own sword has devoured your prophets,\n    like a raging lion.",
      "31": "You people of this generation,\nconsider the word of the Lord.\nHave I been a wilderness to Israel,\nor a land of deep darkness?\nWhy do my people say, “We are free to wander.\nWe will not come to you anymore”?",
      "32": "Does a virgin about to be married forget her jewelry?\nDoes a bride forget her veil?\nBut my people have forgotten me for countless days.",
      "33": "How practiced you are in the ways that you pursue love!\nEven the most evil women could learn from your ways.",
      "34": "The lifeblood of poor, innocent people is found on your skirt,\neven though you did not catch them breaking in.\nIn spite of all this,",
      "35": "you say, “I am innocent.\nHe will not be angry with me.”\nBut I have indeed judged you\nbecause you say, “I have not sinned.”",
      "36": "How fickle you are in changing your direction!\nYou will be disappointed by Egypt,\njust as you were by Assyria.",
      "37": "So you will leave there with your hands on your head,\nbecause the Lord has rejected the ones you trust.\nYou will receive no help from them."

      "2": "Look up to the bare hills and see.\nIs there any place where you have not engaged in sex?\nYou sat by the roadsides waiting for lovers,\n    like a nomad in the desert.\nYou have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.",
      "3": "That is why the showers have been withheld,\nand the spring rains have not come.\nYet you have the shameless look of a prostitute.\nYou refuse to be ashamed.",
      "4": "Did you not just call to me, “My father!\nYou are my close friend from my youth!”?",
      "5": "You say, “Will he be angry for so long?\nWill he keep up his wrath forever?”\nYes, that is what you say,\nbut you do whatever evil you can.",
      "6": "In the days of King Josiah, the Lord asked me:\nHave you seen what unfaithful Israel did? She has gone up onto every high hill and under every green tree and acted like a prostitute there.",
      "7": "I told myself that after she did all this, she would return to me, but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.",

      "10": "In spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah did not turn back to me with all her heart, but only pretended, declares the Lord.",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to me:\nUnfaithful Israel is more righteous than treacherous Judah.",
